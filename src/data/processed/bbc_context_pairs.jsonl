And you're seeing them with two eyes rather than with a camera, which sees them with one.\"\n\nYeo says his aim with portraits is to get across the \"unvarnished truth\" of the sitter\n\nYeo's entry to the world of portraits was unconventional. \"I've been doing portraits for nearly 30 years now,\" he explains, \"but I never went to art school and so I never had any formal training.\"\n\nInstead, the artist developed his own techniques and style. \"Portraits are not easy, and it was quite good training because it forced me to figure out how to do it.\"\n\nHis self-taught methods led to a successful career, including a show dedicated to Yeo's work at the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) and a host of exhibitions in museums around the world.\n\n\"Yeo, the closest we have to a latter-day society portraitist in the spirit of Joshua Reynolds, paints flattering portraits with an old-fashioned Modernist edge,\" said Fisun Guner of the Arts Desk in his review of Yeo's NPG show.\n\nThe artist is now set to put his decades of experience into teaching. Yeo has recorded a series of lessons for BBC Maestro - a commercial service funded by subscriptions where experts share their skills.\n\nMany of Yeo's portraits are of high-profile figures, something which, he says, can be both a blessing and a curse.\n\n\"In some ways, if people are well known, they're a bit more used to being scrutinised and having their photograph taken,\" he notes. \"Which can be an advantage, because they're not as awkward at first, but it might also be that you have to scratch a bit harder to remove the public face.\"\n\nHere is a selection of some of the big names Yeo has painted:\n\nIn the mid 2010s, Cara Delevingne's star was still on the rise. As a model, she dominated fashion pages, but she was also forging a career as an actress and author.\n\nYeo recalls the model, now 31, wanted to have fun and play around more than many of his other sitters - something which ultimately benefitted the resulting portraits he produced in 2015.\n\n\"She would come in and and she didn't like to sit still,\" he recalls. \"But she did tend to look around, and we had a whole load of things left over from a party, some glasses and goggles, and she started putting all these things on and playing around.\n\n\"So I ended up doing several pictures of her for a museum in Denmark where she was in a different performance mode in each one.\"\n\nHe adds: \"My favourite was when she put this Groucho Marks disguise on [pictured top]. So you've got this supermodel who's generally paid quite a lot of money to have her picture taken, and you could barely see that it's her because of these eyebrows.\"\n\nOf the actors he has painted, one that particularly sticks in Yeo's mind is Taron Egerton - whom he captured while he was portraying Sir Elton John in the 2019 biopic Rocketman.\n\n\"I thought I'd do something that was more about that idea of elusiveness, and the point where the actor stops and the character starts,\" he says.\n\n\"But also, he was portraying someone we know in the real world, Elton John, who's also got the performance Elton and the private Elton.\n\n\"So I thought it was kind of fun to have this picture of him in character in one of the outfits from the movie, but you've hopefully got this sense of a moving target of where the identity is.\"\n\nYeo recalls another actor he got on well with during sitting - but who ended up accidentally missing his next show.\n\n\"Kristen Scott Thomas was great and said she was going to come to my exhibition in Denmark,\" he recalls. \"She showed up a week early, she had got the dates wrong. She ended up helping me hang the exhibition, but missed the opening!\"\n\nOne of Yeo's portraits which attracted the most attention was tha", "continuation": "t of Jonathan Ive, who was chief design officer of Apple at the time (2018).\n\nIve played a key role in developing the look of the iPod, iPhone, iPad and MacBook.\n\n\"I was interested in this idea he mentioned one day that he'd always been fascinated by self-portraiture as a kid, and had written his thesis on it,\" Yeo says.\n\n\"So I loved that - this guy had been partially responsible for putting cameras on the iPhone and basically indirectly was responsible for billions of selfies, more than had ever been made when he wrote his thesis.\n\n\"I thought that link was lovely, so in the picture he was sort of making a selfie but we flipped it around a bit.\"\n\nOne artist painting another artist is surely an intimidating proposition. \"It's a bit more stressful,\" Yeo acknowledges.\n\nHe highlights Grayson Perry, an artist who is also well known for dressing as a woman, as an example.\n\n\"[Perry] used to come and sit on Wednesdays, that was his day for being [alter-ego] Claire. So I said 'I don't mind what you wear, but it would be helpful if you wore the same thing'.\n\n\"And of course he totally ignored that,\" Yeo laughs, \"and one day would come in as a Victorian schoolgirl, another day as a power-dressed 80s businesswoman with bouffant hair.\n\n\"I don't know if it was deliberate and he was playing with me. I could've carried on doing that one for years, I always learn so much from him.\"\n\nAt the time Yeo painted Sir Tony, the former prime minister happened to be wearing a poppy at the time of his sittings as it was close to Remembrance Day. The piercing red of of the poppy was noticeable against Sir Tony's grey suit.\n\nYeo recalls Sir Tony as an impressive communicator - something he was able to observe on the campaign trail.\n\n\"To some extent, I would group politicians with actors because they're often quite sophisticated performers,\" Yeo says. \"Tony Blair was very impressive and was good at projecting what he wanted to project, but he used his body language, the way he said things, to suit the purpose.\n\n\"I followed some politicians around on an election campaign a long time ago, and you'd see them in different situations, and he would subtly adapt to each situation almost like a mimic would do, taking on the body language and other affectations.\"\n\nJonathan Yeo: Portrait Painting is released on the BBC Maestro platform on 24 January."}

The main cause is ultraviolet light, which comes from the sun or sunbeds.\n\nFactors such as age, pale skin, a large number of moles, and a family history of skin cancer can increase an individual's chances of developing melanoma.\n\nSigns to look out for include a new mole, a change in an existing mole, large moles, and even moles that are either an uneven shape or a mixture of colours.\n\nThe NHS says people who notice new moles, changes to existing moles, moles that are painful, itchy, or bleeding are encouraged to contact their GP.\n\nIndividuals can lower their chances of developing melanoma by covering arms and legs when exposed to the sun and wearing sunscreen."}

For years it has carried out strikes on Iranian-linked targets in Syria.\n\nSuch strikes have intensified since the Israel-Gaza war began following Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israel.\n\nIn a statement posted on the president's officials website, Mr Raisi expressed his condolences to the families of the \"high-ranking martyrs\".\n\nHe vowed to avenge their deaths, and described the attack as a \"cowardly assassination of five of Iran's most distinguished advisors\".\n\nThe statement described the strike as \"terrorist and criminal\" and said it \"shows the height of [Israel's] desperation and weakness against the combatants of the resistance front\".\n\n\"It will not remain unanswered,\" said the statement.\n\nIran's foreign ministry said the attacks were an \"aggressive and provocative\" act by Israel, urging international actors to condemn them.\n\nSenior figures among the Iranian Revolutionary Guard - a major military, political and economic force in Iran - have been present in Syria since the civil war began there in 2011, helping to support the regime of President Bashar al-Assad against widespread rebellion to his rule.\n\nSaturday's attack took place in the Mazzeh neighbourhood, south-west Damascus, an area home to a military airport, as well as the UN headquarters in Damascus, embassies and restaurants.\n\nIran's semi-official Mehr news agency said the attacks killed the IRGC's Syria intelligence chief and his deputy, as well as other Guard members.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based campaign group, said 10 people were killed in the strikes, including leaders of the Revolutionary Guard.\n\nThe state-run Syrian Arab News Agency quoted a military source as saying it had managed to stop some ", "continuation": "of the missiles, but that the attacks - which it said had hit a residential building - killed and injured some civilians.

More than 132 hostages are thought to still be held in the territory.\n\nMore than 24,900 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its military response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel says its ground and air operation in Gaza is aimed at destroying Hamas.\n\nThe conflict has raised concerns about a wider war spreading around the region, particularly between fierce rivals Israel and Iran, and amid a series of overlapping crises.\n\nIsrael is targeting the Palestinian group Hamas, which is supported by Tehran. It has been carrying out precision strikes across the border in Syria for some time now, bombing weapons supplies heading for its Iran-backed foe, Hezbollah, or taking out key figures in that supply chain, and it is also exchanging fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nIran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria are also targeting US forces in the region, and the US and UK have struck the Houthis - another Iran-backed group - in Yemen, who have been attacking ships in the Red Sea.\n\nFears about an even wider conflict were further heightened this week, when Iran exchanged strikes with its neighbour Pakistan.\n\nOn Tuesday, Iran admitted carrying out a missile and drone attack in south-western Pakistan, killing two children, saying it was targeting an \"Iranian terrorist group\" in Pakistan.\n\nDays later, Islamabad hit back, launching strikes it said were targeting \"terrorist hideouts\" in south-eastern Iran, killing nine people.\n\nAlthough both sides insisted they were targeting militant bases in each other's countries, Iran and Pakistan withdrew their ambassadors from the respective capitals.\n\nBut following talks, diplomatic ties were restored.\n\nIran has hit targets in Pakistan, Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan, Turkey has also bombed Kurdistan, while Jordan has attacked drug smugglers across its border with Syria.\n\nThe US is still hitting ISIS in Syria and simultaneously fighting off drone strikes by Iran's proxies there and in Iraq.\n\nThere is no common policy behind these attacks, other than the well-worn pretext of \"acting in national self defence\".\n\nCorrection 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas.

{"context": "The past week has seen new rounds of violence across the Middle East, deepening fears of conflict spreading in an already unstable region.\n\nHere is a brief guide to what has happened - and where it might lead.\n\nOn Tuesday, Iran unexpectedly carried out a missile and drone attack on Pakistani territory. Iran said it was targeting an Iranian Sunni Muslim militant group, Jaish al-Adl, that has staged attacks inside Iran. Pakistan said two children were killed and swiftly hit back, launching missiles at Pakistani \"terrorist hideouts\" on Iran's side of the border. Iran said three women, two men and four children were killed.\n\nThe flare-up has heightened tensions in a region already experiencing a multitude of crises. Although the area of the tit-for-tat strikes is far from the main theatres of fighting in the Middle East, the border is volatile and further incidents here could quickly escalate, for instance if Jaish al-Adl retaliates against Iran.\n\nThis week saw multiple rounds of US Navy missile strikes against the Houthi Zaidi Shia movement in Yemen, following Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a waterway crucial to world trade. The Houthis - backed by Iran - stepped up their attacks in November following the outbreak of the war in Gaza. They vowed to target \"Israeli-linked\" boats so long as Israel's offensive continued, to show solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nConsequently all merchant shipping in the international waters has been put under threat, something considered intolerable by Western powers. The US and UK, backed by allies, launched the first air strikes against the Houthis last week to try to deter them - but the group has remained defiant.\n\nOn Monday, the Houthis hit a US vessel in the Gulf of Aden in what appeared to be their first successful attack on an American ship since their campaign began. A second was hit in the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday and the Houthis have vowed to continue - raising the prospect of further US strikes and the question of whether Iran will feel forced to respond.\n\nAn increasingly intensifying years-long shadow war between arch-foes Israel and Iran ratcheted up on Monday when Iran fired missiles at what it described as headquarters of Israel's Mossad spy agency in Irbil in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, killing four people. Iraq - an ally of Iran and hostile to Israel - denied Mossad was there and condemned the attack.\n\nIran said its attack was a response to the alleged Israeli killings recently of a senior Iranian commander in Syria and two top Iran-backed militants in Lebanon - one a commander of the Shia militant movement Hezbollah and the other the deputy leader of the Palestinian group Hamas.\n\nThe Israel-Lebanese border, where Israel and Hezbollah - heavily armed and funded by Iran - have frequently traded strikes since the Hamas attack on Israel and start of the Gaza war on 7 October, is one of the most dangerous fronts in the region.\n\nOn Wednesday Israel's military chief of staff said \"the likelihood of [war in the north] happening in the coming months is much higher than it was in the past.\"\n\nAt the same time as it struck in Iraq, Iran fired missiles into a rebel-held province in north-west Syria, saying it had targeted bases of the Islamic State (IS) group in retaliation for IS suicide bombings in southern Iran on 3 January which killed 94 people. IS, a Sunni jihadist group, considers Shia Muslims heretical, and Iran is the dominant Shia power in the region.\n\nWhile Iran is a key ally of the Syrian government, directly striking militants in the rebel-held region is a rare step and a signal to its adversaries that Iran is prepared to act far afield.\n\nAn air strike on the Syrian capital, Damascus, on Saturday killed 10 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Five of them were senior members of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nIt follows similar strikes around Damascus earlier in the week. Israel has not commented, but has previously acknowledged carrying out hundreds of aerial operations in Syria involving attacks on targets it says are linked to Iran. An interception of a fighter aircraft by Syrian air defences - which has so far not happened - or deadly retaliation could ignite a new crisis in a region beset by wars.\n\nIntense fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has continued, with the war there now in its 15th week. At least 891 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli bombardment since last Sunday, raising the death toll there since 7 October to more than 25,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. On the Israeli side, nine soldiers were killed in the same period, bringing its combat death total to 189.\n\nIsrael intensified its offensive on the southern city of Khan Younis this week, while troops reached their furthest point south since the start of the war, the Israeli military said. Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the conflict could go on until 2025, Israeli TV reported this week.\n\nIsrael was also hit by a car-ramming and stabbing attack on Monday, for which police arrested two Palestinian suspects from the occupied West Bank. The attack, which was praised by Hamas, killed a woman and injured 17 other people. It was one of the first such attacks inside Israel since the start of the Gaza war, heightening anxieties among Israelis still reeling from the 7 October attacks.\n\nViolence has also escalated in the West Bank alongside the war. Israeli air strikes there on Wednesday killed nine Palestinians, medics said. Israel said at least five of the dead were planning an imminent attack.\n\nMissiles were fired at an air base used by US-led coalition forces in western Iraq on Saturday, injuring several US military personnel, US Central Command said. Iranian-backed militants are suspected of being behind the attack.\n\nBases housing US and coalition forces in Iraq and north-east Syria have been attacked dozens of times by Iranian-backed militants in recent months, drawing US retaliation. The attacks are seen as part of Iran's indirect conflict with the US, where it can strike US assets at arms length.\n\nAbout 3,400 coalition personnel are in Iraq and Syria as part of efforts to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group, which still operates in pockets in the region.\n\nAttacks by one country into another have also been happening in other places in the Middle East this week.\n\nTurkey carr", "continuation": "ied out air strikes against Kurdish militants in northern Iraq and a US-backed Kurdish-led militia alliance in northern Syria on Monday, its defence ministry said. The latest strikes are part of a decades-long and bloody conflict between Turkey and armed Kurdish groups which Turkey, which has a large Kurdish minority, regards as terrorist organisations. One of the strikes is reported to have hit a prison holding more than 3,000 IS prisoners.\n\nThere were also rare air strikes by Jordan across its border with Syria. Ten people, including children, are reported to have been killed. It is thought to have targeted drug smugglers. Iran-backed militias in Syria have been accused by Jordan of trafficking the amphetamine Captagon into the kingdom and on to Gulf Arab states."}

I am no longer able to provide the simplest requirements of life for my children.\n\n\"I hold the Israeli occupation responsible for the massive destruction, but I do not absolve Hamas of responsibility for everything that happened,\" he said.\n\nHamas is the Palestinian group which has run Gaza since 2007. Its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, was thought to have about 30,000 members before the 7 October attack.\n\n\"The worst thing that could happen is that we return to the previous situation, to a war every two or three years. The situation was difficult before the war and has become catastrophic now,\" Mr Khaldi said.\n\n\"The prices of goods have risen tenfold and most basic necessities are not available.

Mr Mahmoud witnessed a major Israeli attack that took place in northern Gaza and left for Khan Younis during the week-long humanitarian truce at the end of November.\n\n\"We feel that the ground is shaking under us, something like an earthquake, and this is repeated almost every evening, the bombings seem to target the tunnels,\" he told the BBC. \"When we were in Gaza [City], most of the attacks were from the air.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nManifestations of security breakdown are spreading throughout Gaza, and people are complaining about the phenomenon of theft and armed robbery.\n\nA journalist who requested anonymity told the BBC: \"I was returning from my job in Rafah late at night. I had three masked people stop me - they were carrying knives, and one of them was carrying a gun.\n\n\"They searched the car for anything valuable. One of them noticed that I was a journalist and allowed me to leave.\"\n\nOn the streets of Rafah masked police officers with guns in police cars can be seen, but people are complaining that they are not doing enough to deter merchants who monopolise goods and raise prices in an insane manner.\n\n\"I bought a bag of wheat marked Unrwa [the UN agency for Palestinian refugees] for $100 (£79; €92) - 10 times the original price. Why are the police not arresting the war traders who sell wheat most likely stolen from the UN aid agencies?\" complained Mohammed Sheik Khalil.\n\n\"I can't find milk for my baby, my son has autism and has not received treatment for months. I cannot calm him down, and his condition has deteriorated after we made great strides in treating him before the war.\"\n\nHamas always worked according to emergency plans during the previous four wars, but this time it is different.\n\nThe Israeli army has destroyed the government system, killed a large number of security and police officers, and destroyed security headquarters and police stations, leaving ordinary crime uncontrolled.\n\nNeveen Imadedin, a mother displaced from her home in Gaza City and now living in the southern town of Rafah, said: \"We want the war to end but with a sustained long-term political solution. We want our state, not to return to the no-peace, no-war situation.\n\n\"Look what happened to us, thieves stole everything from my house, my clothes, home furni", "continuation": "ture and even solar panels.\"\n\n\"My house is located in the western part of Gaza City and was hit by four shells from the Israeli tanks that were controlling the neighbourhood.\n\n\"We are displaced here in Rafah and before that [we were] in Khan Younis.

{"context": "Something strange is happening in part of the UK.\n\nNormally, when we ask politicians who they think will win an election they are performatively shy. \"Ooh, I couldn't possibly say,\" or, \"You should know far better than to ask before a single vote has been cast, Laura!\"\n\nBut there is one prominent politician who claims to know the outcome of the upcoming general election. They say it's \"inevitable\" that Sir Keir Starmer will be the next PM - and they're not even in the Labour Party.\n\nYou voters are a volatile bunch and polling suggests swathes of the public are yet to make up their minds. So what is exactly is the First Minister of Scotland, Humza Yousaf, up to when he proclaims so confidently that Starmer will reach Downing Street - and that the Labour leader \"doesn't need Scotland\" in order to do it?\n\nThe great polling guru Sir John Curtice tells me that, as thing stands, Yousaf is technically right. Based on current numbers, Labour does not have to win dozens of seats in Scotland to get back into power. \"Frankly the Labour Party at the moment is going to go walkies without needing to do particularly well\" with Scottish voters, he says.\n\nYet at the risk of sounding like a broken record: the election is miles away. Polls are polls, not elections. Nearly all MPs privately believe the polls will narrow when we get to the campaign proper (although this too is not inevitable). Labour needs an epic swing to get a majority even of one, and Scotland's 57 seats might be utterly crucial.\n\nIn 2019 the SNP's dominance in Scotland was absolute - the biggest party by miles for the third general election in a row. The SNP took 48 seats while Labour managed only one. Now there is a real fight between them for first place with the possibility, as things stand, they end up with roughly the same number. You read those numbers right: the SNP could lose about half their seats.\n\nWhat the first minister is really trying to say to voters, according to a senior SNP MP, is: \"Don't worry about getting rid of the Tories - that's going to happen anyway.\"\n\nYousaf's challenge is to make the SNP relevant in a UK-wide argument about generational change - and to draw voters into thinking about what Sir Keir Starmer, as prime minister, would actually do for Scotland on big issues such as public spending and an independence referendum.\n\nBut another SNP MP says there is \"anger and dismay\" at the argument Yousaf is making to voters, which they describe as \"all over the place\". You can see and listen to Yousaf try to explain it on the show.\n\nYou can also expect the party in the coming days and weeks to try to lure Labour into a fight on their terms, the senior MP says: \"I want to see him come north and onto our territory.\"\n\nFights about the pitch to the public don't mask the enormous changes that have taken place before our eyes to one of the biggest political forces. The SNP approaches the general election as a completely different outfit to last time around, and that makes the job of convincing voters to stick with them difficult, whatever the message.\n\nTheir decline in the polls is partly because voters didn't like seeing the party's divisions and disagreements during its leadership campaign after Nicola Sturgeon quit.\n\nBut the position had already changed before those messy few months, because Tory disasters under Boris Johnson and then Liz Truss prompted some softer Scottish unionists to shift to Labour. The Conservative crash under Liz Truss made it look much more likely that Labour could win a majority - and by implication the SNP lost its potential leverage in the event of a hung parliament.\n\nHumza Yousaf, still a relatively new leader, seems to have been unable to catch a break as he grapples with a series of embarrassments that just seem to keep coming.\n\nThe police investigation into the party's finances, the arrest of Nicola Sturgeon herself and subsequent release without charge, and a minister in trouble over roaming charges on his work iPad. In the last 24 hours we've seen revelations about government WhatsApps being deleted during the pandemic.\n\nThe polls suggest - and his colleagues acknowledge privately - that Yousaf is yet to convince the public he is an effective leader with a compelling argument to make. And without a realistic prospect of another referendum on independence any time soon, the constitutional argument that used to enthuse some voters doesn't galvanise support as it did before.\n\nThat said, voters in Scotland are as volatile as in the rest of the UK", "continuation": ", and things could change quickly.\n\nOne of his backers argues that Yousaf has played \"probably the most difficult hand imaginable\" about as well as anyone could have. There is no question that he inherited a mess not all of his own making.\n\nBut there is little sign of him being able to improve the situation, with a widespread tacit acknowledgement that the party will fall back. One MP even fears the SNP would be better off in opposition at Holyrood to sort itself out, with the chance of independence \"put back by a decade by Sturgeon's antics\", they fear.\n\nArguments about the constitution and whether or not to have another independence referendum used to protect the SNP somewhat from judgement on its record. With that fading, voters seem willing to judge the party's achievements - or lack of - more harshly than they did before.\n\nHumza Yousaf wants to make the argument that it is \"inevitable\" that Keir Starmer will be PM - instead there is widespread belief that it's inevitable the SNP will fall back significantly at the next election, possibly losing its position as the third biggest party at Westminster if the Lib Dems score well. That would be a huge redrawing of the political map.\n\nYousaf might not like the comparison but as the election draws closer, it's inevitable too that parallels will be drawn between the SNP and the Conservatives. Both have a young, new-ish leader, who inherited a mess, in charge of a party that had been dominant for more than a decade.\n\nWith infighting and a patchy record, the hopes of a turnaround fade as the months pass, and the poll that matters at the ballot box approaches. That could describe our PM Rishi Sunak - but right now it could describe Humza Yousaf too.\n\nWhat questions would you like to ask Humza Yousaf this Sunday?\n\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

{"context": "Tou Ger Xiong is one of several Americans whose deaths in Colombia have been linked to dating apps\n\nA series of mysterious deaths involving American men in Colombia has been linked to dating apps. Relatives of those killed are now searching for answers, writes Austin Landis in Medellin.\n\n\"He talked about the high spirited people… just enjoying life,\" his brother, Eh Xiong, told BBC News. \"He even picked up Spanish.\n\n\"It never, ever even crossed his mind that he would end up in a tragic incident this way.\"\n\nTou Ger, 50, was a Hmong-American community activist and comedian from Minnesota. Prior to his most recent trip to Medellin, he had been speaking to a woman online.\n\nA few weeks into his two-month visit, in mid-December, he called his brother and asked him for $2,000 but didn't say what it was for or that anything was wrong. Eh said he would transfer the money. He never heard from his brother again.\n\nThe next day, police found Tou Ger's body in a remote, wooded area of the city. A friend in Medellin explained to Eh that his brother had been kidnapped and held at gunpoint for the $2,000 ransom.\n\n\"I did not want to believe it. I didn't know if it was really happening,\" Eh ", "continuation": "said. \"My heart just sank.\"\n\nEh scrambled to contact the US embassy, who confirmed it was his brother's body. Colombian police this week arrested a woman and two men linked to his death, charging them with kidnapping and murder.\n\nIt's not clear whether he first met the woman through a dating app or through friends. But his death is one of eight in Medellin that prompted a warning from the US embassy about the risks of using dating apps. All eight victims were Americans who died in suspicious circumstances in November and December.\n\nThe US state department said it was aware of a gang in the city that previously used dating apps to isolate victims before abducting and killing them. But it's unclear if a gang was behind the US deaths.\n\nIn the first 10 months of 2023, Medellin's tourism observatory had already recorded 32 violent killings of foreigners in the city - including at least 12 Americans and three from the United Kingdom - a 40% increase from the previous year.\n\nJeff Hewett was found \"lying dead in a pool of blood\" in his Medellin hotel room, his friends wrote online, describing him as \"an easy-going, wry, kind spirit\" and apparent victim of a \"robbery gone bad\".\n\nJohny Jerome was killed on his 45th birthday. Phillip Mullins was drugged and died of an overdose, according to local media reports.\n\nThe embassy says several of these cases began with a dating app used to lure victims, part of a concerning increase in people who end up \"drugged, robbed, and even killed by their Colombian dates\". Neither Tinder nor Bumble, both popular in the city, would comment.\n\nCarlos Calle, the former director of the city's tourism observatory, said it's common for criminals to drug tourists with scopolamine, an odourless substance known as \"Devil's Breath\". The US embassy also warned about the drug, which sedates victims for up to 24 hours.\n\n\"There's a negative profile of the tourist in the city that looks for a certain type of opportunities,\" said Calle in an interview. It's usually related to sex work, he said.\n\nA spokesperson for the tourism observatory confirmed that the \"majority\" of victims last year were men, but added that many cases are still under investigation.\n\nProstitution is legal in Colombia and widespread in tourism hotspots like the cities of Medellin and Cartagena. But there's nothing to suggest the men killed were using prostitutes.\n\nAlok Shah, 36, thinks scopolamine is what caused his vision to \"go sideways\" when he brought a woman back to his hotel room in late 2022. It was like his short-term memory was disappearing, he said.\n\nThe Texas resident had matched with a Colombian woman in her mid-20s on Tinder. They first went out for coffee, but Shah later decided to buy beers and bring her to his hotel.\n\nHe says he hadn't felt unsafe during his previous frequent visits to Medellin, or like prostitution was as prevalent when he first came in 2017. But he knew women were a draw to the city. \"If you're a single guy, the women are very lovely here,\" a friend had told him.\n\nBefore his watch, jacket and $200 in cash disappeared that night, he remembers his date rubbing a powder on his neck. But he stayed conscious enough to realise something was wrong, threatening to call the police and chasing her away.\n\n\"I generally don't interact with the locals there now,\" he said. \"There's just too much danger, there's too much risk.\"\n\nThe new US embassy notice recommends its citizens avoid taking dates to private places like hotels, plus inform friends, family or building staff about who they're with. And don't resist a robbery because that could be fatal.\n\nMedellin's city police would not comment on the recent increase in violent deaths and referred BBC News to the mayor's office.\n\n\"We want more and more foreigners to come to the city,\" said Mayor Federico Gutierrez, but added that tourists coming purely for sex and drugs were not welcome. He said he's directed the police to crack down on what he says is a related underlying issue - the sex trafficking of minors.\n\nPolice have been directed to begin \"special interventions\" in the neighbourhoods where tourism is most prominent, a spokesperson for the mayor told BBC News, including the popular nightlife area called El Poblado.\n\nMore than 1.4 million foreigners visited the city as tourists in 2022, a new record over previous years, and over a quarter were American, according to statistics released by the mayor's office. The numbers for 2023 are expected to be even higher, partly because Medellin has become a top destination for remote workers.\n\nLast week, Eh Xiong came to Medellin himself for the first time, to carry out a Hmong tradition by calling his brother's spirits back home.\n\n\"We're not mad at the people of Colombia,\" he said. \"I truly believe that he would have forgiven the people who did that to him.\"\n\nHe added: \"[Tou Ger had] this quick wit, fearlessness, that believes in the goodness of all people.\"\n\nAustin Landis is a multimedia journalist based in Medellin, covering migration and stories from Colombia.

{"context": "These are shape-shifting times in the Middle East.\n\nThis week, out of the blue, Iran suddenly attacked targets in \"friendly\" Pakistan, sparking an unprecedented tit-for-tat across their volatile border and a sharp spike in tension on a far edge of the grievous Israel-Gaza war.\n\nIran wanted a message to be heard loud and clear - at home, and a long way beyond.\n\n\"It has showcased its missile arsenal and its willingness to use it,\" says Vali Nasr, professor of international affairs and Middle East studies at Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\"It was a message also likely intended for Israel and the US in the midst of the Gaza war, especially with the potential escalation in Lebanon and Yemen.\"\n\nLike most observers, he believes \"for now Iran is not looking to escalate\".\n\nEver since the Gaza war exploded after Hamas's murderous 7 October assault on southern Israel, it has been darkened by fears of an even more dangerous contagion. No-one, including Iran and its principal partner Hezbollah, as well as the United States", "continuation": ", wants to see an even hotter conflagration.\n\nIran's war has been a web of shadow wars. It sits at the fulcrum of what it calls an \"axis of resistance\", the alliance of Tehran-backed groups dotting the region, from Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, to the Houthis in Yemen, and well-armed groups in both Iraq and Syria. Most have been designated as terrorist entities by some Western states.\n\nTheir military prowess is rooted in Iran's accelerated arming and training; each actor also has agendas and ambitions of its own.\n\nFires have been burning on all these fronts, and sometimes blazing, with efforts to douse the flames lest they provoke crippling Israeli and American reprisals.\n\nWhen Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) carried out these first direct strikes since this crisis erupted, they trained their sights on Pakistan and two other friendly countries. They may have seen them as areas of least resistance beyond the highly combustible landscape of their \"axis of resistance\".\n\nIran's elite force unleashed a barrage of ballistic missiles and suicide drones against what it called an intelligence centre for Israel's Mossad spy agency in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq, and at \"anti-Iran terror groups\" including Islamic State in rebel-controlled swathes of Syria.\n\nEach operation was said to have its own specific retaliatory rationale.\n\nIran says it had to aim fire at Iranian Baloch separatists operating in restive southwest Pakistan.\n\n\"An attack was imminent. They had gathered and were leaving the base,\" says Prof Seyed Mohammad Marandi at the University of Tehran. He also points to last month's killing of 11 Iranian police officers in its tense province of Sistan and Balochistan.\n\nPakistan also spoke of an \"impending attack\" when it then fired its own salvos two days later into southern Iran against what it said were bases of its own Baloch nationalists, which it called \"terrorist targets\". This cross-border tension has simmered for decades; this is its worst moment.\n\nNorthern Iraq and Syria, closer to the Gaza epicentre, were about settling separate scores.\n\n\"The attacks in Iraq and Syria were retaliation for the general as well as the atrocity in Kerman,\" explains Prof Marandi. He's referring to last month's assassination just outside Damascus of one of the IRGC's most senior men, Sayyed Razi Mousavi, which was widely reported as the work of an Israeli air strike.\n\nThen, earlier this month, a double suicide bombing shattered a memorial service in Iran for Qasem Soleimani, the top commander assassinated by an American drone in Iraq four years ago. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the deadliest attack in Iran since the 1979 revolution.\n\n\"Iran has been under pressure to react, including to the killing of senior Hamas and Hezbollah commanders in Lebanon, but it doesn't want to get directly embroiled in any escalation by hitting Israel or the US,\" says Mohammad Ali Shabani, editor of Amwaj media, which provides in-depth analyses of the region.\n\n\"We are going to continue to see a slow boil,\" he says.\n\nThese are also tough times at home for Iran's ruling clerics. They've faced unprecedented women-led protests over social freedoms and more, as well as financial woes stemming from international sanctions, alleged corruption, and mismanagement.\n\nAnd there has been blowback after these latest operations, with angry denunciations from Iraq, as well as the Arab League, and an even more forceful rebuke from Pakistan.\n\n\"They did not think through that striking in Pakistan territory could just have no repercussions,\" remarks former Pakistan foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar. \"Their action created a crater of distrust. It will take hard work and persistence to fill.\"\n\nThere are wars within wars in every corner of this conflict. Pakistan also had to be seen to be setting its own red lines in a neighbourhood where age-old rival India, as well as Taliban-run Afghanistan, were watching closely. Accusations and more of harbouring hostile forces have long been hurled across those borders too.\n\nThis past week has been a reminder, if one was needed, of the unpredictability and peril in this moment of a widening and worsening Israel-Gaza war.\n\nAny day can be a flare-up on one or multiple fronts - and there are the longer-term risks being shaped in a region where fault lines were deeply and darkly etched long before Hamas's 7 October attacks.\n\nIsrael's largest loss of life in a single day since the founding of its state, as well as the seizing of more than 250 hostages, sparked a military campaign causing a staggering number of civilian deaths and turning much of Gaza into an unliveable wasteland.\n\nIt has enraged and emboldened this Iran-backed military alliance of militant non-state actors. They've been drawing closer for years. Now they've forged a far more vocal and visible league.\n\nFor Iran's adversaries, the proverbial \"we need to do something about Iran\" may now be even riskier. It may also mean confronting Tehran's staunchest allies across the region.\n\n\"Tehran has achieved what the Pentagon calls military 'overmatch' - a level of capability in which a country has weaponry that makes it extremely difficult to check or defeat,\" says Robin Wright, author of several books on Iran and a distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars.\n\nThis current escalation has not been cost-free. US salvos against Iranian-backed fighters in Iraq are reported to have significantly damaged their infrastructure.\n\nThe Pentagon says its air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, in an effort to stop their attacks on vessels in the vital Red Sea shipping lanes, have destroyed a quarter of the Houthi arsenal.\n\nBut on the balance sheets of some of Iran's allies, they believe they're winning far more than they're losing. Standing up for Gazans has galvanised their popularity on Arab streets. Yemen's Houthis in particular are relishing being catapulted into the centre of world attention.\n\nMinds are already focused on the \"day after\", when this Israel-Gaza war ends, including in Tehran, which has long prided itself on its \"strategic patience\".\n\n\"Iran is playing a broader longer game,\" points out Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House. \"It perhaps anticipates that after Gaza winds down Israel is going to be more provocative towards Iran, so it is preparing for a longer fight.\"\n\nIran's long-term goals include keeping the US out of its backyard, and avoiding a direct confrontation with Israel and America.\n\nThat means careful calculations on where and how it strikes in a hazardous region where the risks of miscalculation are always dangerously high."}

Coventry's Kasey Palmer said he received similar abuse at Hillsborough.

The players eventually returned and Milan went on to win 3-2. \"This shouldn't exist in the world of football, but unfortunately for many years this is a recurrence,\" the 28-year-old told Milan TV. \"With all the cameras present and sanctions for these things, something must be done to change things. \"We all have to react, we must do something because you can't play like this.\" Milan and city rivals Inter have both publicly supported Maignan, Serie A said it \"condemns all forms of racism\", while France striker Kylian Mbappe said \"enough is enough\". Former England and Arsenal striker Ian Wright applauded the \"solidarity\" in the Milan side and urged teams to \"keep walking off\" when they hear abuse and called for stronger sanctions. The incident involving Palmer happened during Coventry's 2-1 Championship win over next-to-bottom Sheffield Wednesday and led to the match being stopped for several minutes while the match officials spoke to both managers. South Yorkshire police have launched an investigation and said they \"will be working alongside the clubs and West Midlands Police to understand the circumstances and identify those involved\". Wednesday confirmed the gesture was made by someone in the stands and that anyone \"found culpable\" would face the \"strictest possible sanctions\".

None were found when the tunnel was discovered, though.\n\nIsraeli soldiers have also faced renewed attacks in the north of the Gaza Strip, where Hamas is said to have seized an opening around the town of Jabalia as Israel moved troops and tanks south.\n\nMore than three months since the conflict erupted, Israel - whose army far outstrips Hamas's capabilities - is still facing significant resistance across Gaza.\n\nUS intelligence agencies reportedly estimate that the Israeli military has killed 20-30% of Hamas fighters, which falls far short of Mr Netanyahu's stated aim of \"completely destroying\" the armed group.\n\nThe classified report is also said to have found that Hamas still has enough munitions to continue striking Israel and Israeli forces for months, raising the spectre of a prolonged war in which Israel could get bogged down.\n\nThe apparent slow progress, the fact no top Hamas commander has yet been captured or killed, and the collective trauma over the 130 or so Israeli hostages still missing, is prompting growing anti-government anger in Israel.\n\nProtests are continuing by relatives of those still held by Hamas, calling for Mr Netanyahu to prioritise their release over the potentially impossible aim of destroying Hamas. And a still relatively small anti-war movement is also demonstrating, horrified by the damage wrought on Gaza - one of the most intense and destructive military campaigns in recent history.\n\nMost Israelis have rallied around their flag - but not around their prime minister, who, according to a recent poll, only 15% of the public believe should stay in office once the war ends.\n\nHow it does end is the subject of growing disagreement between Mr Netanyahu and Israel's western allies. After speaking to US President Joe Biden for the first time in almost a month, the Israeli prime minister reiterated his rejection of a future Palestinian state.\n\nIn a post on X - formerly Twitter - he said Israel must retain \"security control over the entire area west of [River] Jordan\", which also encompasses the Israeli-occupied West Bank territory.\n\nMr Netanyahu has been fiercely opposed to a Palestinian state throughout his political career. But by repeatedly asserting it now, an increasingly unpopular prime minister appears to be doubling down on a view that he feels chimes with the majority opinion in a nation too horrified by the attacks to countenance an independent Palestinian state.\n\nHis apparent fight for political survival is clashing with exasperated Israeli allies, who hope that the current bloodshed could force both sides into meaningful diplomacy over a sustainable two-state solution.\n\nUK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC earlier that Mr Netanyahu's stance was \"disappointing\". The White House has said the US and Israel \"clearly see things differently\".\n\nAntonio Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, went further, calling the refusal to accept a Palestinian state \"completely unacceptable\". He added it \"would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security\".\n\nCorrection 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200.

We can smell your fear,\" AfD MP Bernd Baumann declared this week, addressing politicians from the ruling coalition parties.\n\nIt was investigative outlet Correctiv that released a bombshell report about a \"secret\" meeting at a hotel near Berlin in November involving around 20 people - including senior AfD figures and neo-Nazi influencers.\n\nAt least two members of the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU), the party of former Chancellor Angela Merkel, were also said to be present - claims being \"examined\" by party officials", "continuation": ".\n\nDiscussion allegedly focused on so-called \"remigration\" - the removal of millions of asylum seekers, \"non-assimilated\" people and those with \"non-German\" backgrounds, even if they hold residency rights and citizenship.\n\nAfD co-leader Alice Weidel has condemned all talk of a ban of the party\n\nSince its release, the report has sparked large anti-AfD rallies including in Berlin, Cologne and Hamburg, and more are taking place this weekend.\n\nPolice and organisers said at least 300,000 people took part in protests across the country on Saturday, according to initial estimates.\n\nAbout 35,000 marched in Frankfurt, the financial heart of the country, while a similar number turned out in the western city of Dortmund.\n\nAt least 50,000 people turned out in the centre of Hamburg on Friday to hear centre-left Mayor Peter Tschentscher deliver a message to the AfD: \"We are united and determined not to let our country and democracy be destroyed for the second time since 1945.\"\n\nMany at the protest voiced shock at the deportation plan and concern at the strength of the AfD.\n\n\"I feel threatened and I am already making plans to get out of Germany. I don't feel comfortable here any more,\" said one German citizen whose family comes from Latin America.\n\nDemonstrations were expected to take place in about 100 towns and cities throughout the weekend, according to German media, with protests in Berlin, Munich Cologne, Dresden, Leipzig and Bonn on Sunday.\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz has expressed gratitude for the \"tens of thousands\" of protesters, warning that any expulsion plan amounted to \"an attack against our democracy and in turn on all of us\".\n\nFriday's anti-AfD protest in Hamburg was the biggest so far but more cities are holding demos this weekend\n\nThe AfD leadership's response has been one of combative rebuttals mixed with efforts to distance itself from the controversy. It was a private, rather than secret, meeting and it wasn't organised by the party, they insist.\n\n\"Of course everyone who has German citizenship is part of our people,\" said Alice Weidel, the AfD's co-leader and its most recognisable face.\n\n\"That's exactly why the German passport shouldn't be flogged to just anybody.\"\n\nShe condemned any idea of banning her party as well as the reporting that had led to a reigniting of that debate.\n\n\"It is scandalous when left-wing activists using Stasi methods attack a private meeting to spy on respectable citizens.\"\n\nBut Ms Weidel has now notably parted ways with her senior aide, Roland Hartwig, who was among those in attendance.\n\nAustrian far-right activist Martin Sellner, who has previously been barred from the UK, is alleged to have presented the mass deportation \"masterplan\".\n\nIt reportedly included details of moving people to a \"model state\" in North Africa that could provide space for up to two million people.\n\nMr Sellner has promoted the idea of \"remigration\" before, mainly for migrants he considers a \"burden\", but in comments posted on YouTube he said it was mentioned only in passing at Potsdam and then it was \"turned into a masterplan for deportation by the lying press\".\n\nReacting to the reports, 25 Social Democratic Bundestag members called for a ban on the AfD to be examined, particularly for the party's \"extremist\" state associations.\n\nDespite the calls for a ban, the AfD is polling second nationally at more than 20%\n\nBut there's scepticism amongst both lawyers and politicians.\n\n\"A ban makes no sense,\" said Dr Horst Meier, a constitutional lawyer who believes it would be legally possible but ill-advised.\n\n\"The competition between parties needs to happen on the political stage, not in court,\" he told the BBC.\n\nThe German constitution says that parties that seek to undermine or abolish the \"free democratic basic order\" should be deemed unconstitutional.\n\nTwo groups were dissolved in 1950s West Germany: the ultra-right Socialist Reich Party and the Communist KPD, but later cases, against the neo-Nazi NPD, failed.\n\nIn 2003 judges found that infiltration of the NPD by German security services had muddied the waters, while in 2017 the movement was deemed too insignificant.\n\nGerman Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck accused the AfD this week of wanting to turn Germany into a Russian-style autocratic state, in comments seen by some as tacit support for a ban.\n\nBut speaking to Stern magazine, he acknowledged a failed attempt would cause \"massive\" damage.\n\nReports of a secret meeting where mass deportations were discussed have been compared to Nazi plans for the Holocaust\n\nAlso sounding a cautious note was Thorsten Frei, an MP from the CDU: \"We have to ask ourselves a different question.\"\n\n\"If a party like the AfD polls so high there must be reasons. There's no point in insulting voters,\" he said.\n\nAlternative für Deutschland has been enjoying record success in the polls in a significant election year, placing second behind the CDU and ahead of all three coalition parties; the Social Democrats, Greens and Free Democrats.\n\nTheir rise coincides with dissatisfaction among voters with the divided government, as well as policy issues such as the cost of living and levels of immigration.\n\nThe AfD is hoping to make big gains in the European Parliament elections in June and could even emerge as the strongest party in next September's votes in the three eastern states of Thuringia, Saxony and Brandenburg.\n\nAny pursuit of a ban would present serious political dangers as well as legal obstacles.\n\nYet Germany's Interior Minister, Nancy Faeser, promised to \"use all instruments available\" to defend democracy.\n\nThe AfD denies racism, but is already under surveillance and has been classified by domestic intelligence as a right-wing extremist organisation in Saxony, Thuringia and the neighbouring state of Saxony-Anhalt.\n\nReports of the meeting have prompted comparisons to the Nazis' 1940 scheme to deport four million Jews to Madagascar and the Wannsee conference of 1942, where top officials plotted the \"Final Solution\" - the genocide of Europe's Jewish population.\n\n\"Those who fantasise about reconquering and remigration are drawing on the same ideas that paved the way for the inhuman racial laws of the Nazis,\" said Nancy Faeser.\n\nA party ban was the \"sharpest sword available\" and she did not rule out using it, but only as a final step."}

Another featured a man wearing no trousers who had criticised the Chechen leader for singing a song called \"President Putin is my best friend\".\n\nThis man was shown apologising for snowboarding down a slope in a Borat-style \"mankini\"\n\nThe videos soon spread to other parts of the North Caucasus and some were published by police.\n\nIn one from the interior ministry in Karachay-Cherkessia, a man apologised for snowboarding down a mountain slope sporting nothing but a thong, similar to that worn by the comedy character Borat.\n\nMore recently, since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, numerous clips have appeared featuring critics of what it calls its \"special military operation\".\n\nSome were published via official police accounts on social media. Many others were posted by pro-war activists or state media, but they also appear to have had some police involvement.\n\nThey were filmed in barren rooms typical of police stations and use language characteristic of police reports.\n\nIn June last year, a singer called Sharlot burned his passport, saying he did not want to be a citizen of \"a criminal Russia\" and instead wanted to move to Kyiv in a gesture of support for the Ukrainian people.\n\nSharlot posted a video burning his passport but then apologised and said he would not do it again\n\nHe was arrested and soon appeared in a video where he apologised for \"a lapse in understanding what i", "continuation": "s going on\".\n\nIn another example, the interior ministry in Chuvashia, a region about 600km (373 miles) east of Moscow, posted a video of a man apologising for defacing pro-war graffiti. He had painted over a red flag and turned it into the Russian opposition's white-blue-white flag.\n\nOther videos posted by Russian police feature men repenting for offences such as trying to topple a monument in the shape of the letter Z, which has come to symbolise Russia's war, and setting fire to a pro-war blogger's door.\n\nOne man had to apologise for defacing pro-war graffiti in the republic of Chuvashia\n\nThere have been accusations that such videos are often recorded under duress.\n\nFor example, a blogger known as Nekoglay said police in Moscow forced him to appear on camera after stripping him, beating him up and attempting to rape him with a plastic bottle.\n\nThe apology video, released via official news agency Ria Novosti, was posted after he recorded a clip parodying a Russian soldier defending himself from a Ukrainian drone attack.\n\nApology videos are also being used to shame war critics in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine.\n\nTwo-thirds of the apology videos monitored by Russian human rights website OVD-Info over a period of almost 16 months after the start of the invasion actually came from the occupied region of Crimea.\n\nRussian social anthropologist Aleksandra Arkhipova describes the videos as \"rituals of guilt and shame\" that amount to extrajudicial punishment.\n\nVladimir Putin is set for six more years as president and the apology videos have become prevalent during his war with Ukraine\n\n\"This violates internal freedom. This has become the norm, this is very bad. If someone does something wrong, the first thing they're supposed to do is record an apology video,\" she told the BBC.\n\nOne woman in Crimea was shown apologising for sharing Ukrainian songs on her social media accounts and another for posting pictures of various objects in the blue-and-yellow colours of the Ukrainian flag.\n\nA puppet theatre actress from occupied Donetsk who was shown saying sorry for sharing Ukrainian songs on TikTok said later she had been pressured into doing it by the police.\n\n\"Either you record this video or... you're going to jail and your child is going to an orphanage,\" she quoted a police officer as saying.\n\nMs Arkhipova believes that the videos are a product of a president who treats Russia like an overbearing father.\n\n\"Everyone else is like children who have no legal agency of their own. The father is always right. So if they do anything wrong, they have to apologise to their father.\"\n\nShe too has come under pressure from Russian authorities, who have designated her as a \"foreign agent\"."}

I was thinking it was maybe going to be for a couple of days but they said, no, it could be for up to a year.\n\n\"How is anybody supposed to mentally go forward paying £100 a night, racking up a future debt, just to get a home with a housing association?\"\n\nIt comes less than two months after the city became the third council in Scotland to declare a housing emergency.\n\nDaniel was told there was available space in one of Glasgow city centre's bed-and-breakfasts.\n\nCrisis said the use of homeless B&Bs in Scotland has risen by 124% since the Covid pandemic.\n\nHowever, Glasgow City Council said last year it was planning on \"decommissioning\" the hotels as part of a £4.9m savings to its homelessness budget.\n\nMeanwhile, campaigners raised concerns about the number of drug deaths in the city's hostels.\n\nDaniel told BBC Scotland News that his own brother Gary died in homeless accommodation last July.\n\nDaniel's brother Gary Thomson passed away in a homeless hostel last year.\n\n\"It is not a place I want to go,\" he said.\n\n\"Plus the stories I have heard as well - there are a lot of drugs and drug dealing in those types of places and I don't want to be around that.\n\n\"I also wouldn't get to see my daughter if I was in a hostel.\"\n\nHe continued: \"There is no priority for anybody that works. I was even told that I'll be at the bottom of that list and I'll stay there until my circumstances change.\n\n\"It upsets me to know that I am paying all that money to the government in taxes and here I am, walking the streets on my day off.\n\n\"I could be at home or warm in my bed but here I am, walking the streets and freezing.\"\n\nDaniel spoke as Crisis released the latest findings from its Homelessness Monitor this week.\n\nThe UK-wide study analyses homelessness trends across the country as well as the impact of housing policy.\n\nIn England, it found rough sleeping had increased 132% since 2010.\n\nIn Scotland, it suggested \"core homelessness\" happens at a lower rate but has risen 11% since 2020.\n\nIt is expected to rise by a further 33% due to a shortage in social housing, increasing private rent costs and cost of living pressures.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of children in temporary accommodation has reached record levels in Scotland., while half of Scottish councils reported \"significant increases\" in footfall to homelessness services.\n\nGlasgow City Council announced it would 'decommission' some of its homeless bed-and-breakfasts last year.\n\nDr Beth Watts-Cobbe, of Heriot-Watt University, said the rises were \"concerning\".\n\nShe continued: \"But while many of the trends revealed in the Monitor are worrying, the report also shows that projected rises in core homelessness can be prevented through a comprehensive response from policy-makers.\n\n\"Homelessness has been a major area of policy focus for the Scottish government since 2017 and with the right commitment Scotland can reverse these trends and reduce homelessness.\"\n\nThe charity urged the Scottish government to allow people to \"get help up to six months before they are at risk of homelessness, while also introducing new legal duties requiring public services to play a greater role in preventing homelessness\".\n\nThe recommendations are expected to be included in the Scott", "continuation": "ish government's forthcoming Housing Bill, which is supported by Crisis and other charities.\n\nHousing Minister Paul McLennan said the government had \"already committed to many of these measures in our homelessness strategy\".\n\nHe added: \"We are committed to reducing the number of households in temporary accommodation and we are acting on the recommendations of the expert temporary accommodation task and finish group.\n\n\"This includes investing at least £60m in 2023-24 as part of our £752m Affordable Housing Supply Programme to support a national acquisition plan.\n\n\"However, as the report notes, other changes which would make a significant difference are not within the powers of the Scottish government.\n\n\"The UK government should heed the calls from Crisis to increase Housing Benefit and other working age benefits. It is also concerning that another Local Housing Allowance freeze is on the horizon.\"\n\nA UK government spokesperson said it was spending £2bn on tackling rough sleeping in England.\n\nShe added: \"Our Single Homelessness Accommodation Programme is delivering up to 2,400 homes for rough sleepers by March 2025, and through our Rough Sleeping Strategy, we will continue to work to end rough sleeping completely.\"\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

A baby who was in the vehicle survived.\n\nA frozen car after an accident in Iowa on 15 January\n\nOther deaths remain under investigation, including that of a person killed in a five-car crash in Kentucky and four in Illinois.\n\nFive people - most of them presumed to be homeless - died over the course of just four days in Seattle, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIn Mississippi, the weather has prompted officials to warn drivers to \"drive only if necessary\" and \"be aware of black ice\" on the state's roads. Colleges and universities in the state have delayed students' return from winter break due to the conditions.\n\nThe state's death toll rose to 11 after three more deaths were announced there on Sunday.\n\nMississippi officials are also investigating whether online rumours about potential storm-related water shortages prompted residents to store water in their bathtubs. The move caused a temporary drop in water pressure and dry faucets for thousands of residents in Jackson, the state's capital, which has historic water issues.\n\nWater issues also continue to plague Tennessee, where 400,000 remain under a boil water notice due to broken pipes in the Memphis area - one of nearly 30 areas that issues similar warnings.

The prime minister answered questions on the Rwanda bill during Thursday's press conference\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has urged the House of Lords to pass his flagship Rwanda bill, as he warned peers not to \"frustrate the will of the people\".\n\nGiving a press conference after the legislation was approved by MPs, Mr Sunak said it was now up to the Lords to \"do the right thing\".\n\nHe told the BBC the government was still aiming for deportation flights to take off by the spring.\n\nBut he added that peers needed to pass the bill \"as quickly as possible\".\n\nThe legislation, which seeks to revive the government's plan to send some asylum seekers to the east African country, was passed by 320 to 276 votes in the House of Commons on Wednesday.\n\nAlthough in the end only 11 Conservative MPs voted against the legislation as a whole, Mr Sunak still suffered his biggest rebellion since becoming prime minister when around 60 backed changes they said would toughen up the legislation.\n\nThe rebels argue the bill will not work in its current form as they believe flights will still be blocked by legal challenges.\n\nThe aim of the policy is to deter people from crossing the Channel in small boats, which Mr Sunak has made a key priority of his premiership.\n\nHowever, Labour says it an expensive \"gimmick\", which is unworkable and unlawful.\n\nBefore becoming law, the bill must be approved by the House of Lords, where it is expected to face strong opposition.\n\nThe Lords are unlikely to vote it down completely but they can propose changes which would delay its progress.\n\nCrossbench peer Lord Carlile, a leading lawyer and former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, described the bill as \"a step towards totalitarianism\".\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme many peers would see it as \"a step too far\" and an \"illegitimate interference by politics with the law\".\n\nMr Sunak urged peers to pass the bill unamended to get flights up and running, describing this as \"an urgent national priority\".\n\n\"The treaty with Rwanda is signed and the legislation which deems Rwanda a safe country has been passed unamended in our elected chamber,\" he said.\n\n\"There is now only one question. Will the opposition in the appointed House of Lords try and frustrate the will of the people as expressed by the elected House? Or will they get on board and do the right thing?\"\n\nLabour's shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the PM's comments were \"bizarre\".\n\n\"The House of Lords exists to scrutinise legislation,\" he said, adding that this function was \"very important in our democracy\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nQuestioned by journalists after the press conference over when flights carrying asylum seekers would leave for Rwanda, the prime minister did not give a concrete date.\n\nAsked if he could guarantee flights would take off before the next general election, which is expected this year, Mr Sunak said: \"I've been crystal clear that we want to do this as quickly as possible… and it's now up to the House of Lords.\"\n\nHowever, in an interview with the BBC later, he said: \"We're working to the same timetable that we've always been working to... and that means spring but ob", "continuation": "viously the House of Lords needs to pass its legislation as quickly as possible.\"\n\nPeers are due to begin debating the Rwanda bill before the end of this month, with the most crucial votes held in early March, according to senior House of Lords sources.\n\nAfter this, the legislation will enter \"ping pong\", where the Commons and Lords try to reconcile their versions of the bill.\n\nThis is likely to involve the government trying to remove any changes inserted by the Lords.\n\nIf all goes to plan the bill should pass around mid-March.\n\nEven after it becomes law, Mr Sunak's critics believe legal challenges could still delay or block deportation flights.\n\nDebate over the bill has exposed the deep divisions within the Conservative Party.\n\nOn Tuesday two deputy party chairmen - Lee Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith - as well as a ministerial aide, Jane Stevenson, quit their roles to rebel against the government and vote for changes to the bill.\n\nThe BBC has been told a handful of Tory MPs have submitted letters calling for a vote of confidence in Mr Sunak.\n\nHowever, this is almost impossible to prove unless an MP chooses to publish their letter.\n\nIt would take 15% of the parliamentary party - currently 53 MPs - to submit letters to trigger a no-confidence vote.\n\nAfter this a majority of Tory MPs would have to vote against Mr Sunak in a secret ballot for him to be removed as leader."}

{"context": "Up to 3,000 people across the UK could lose their jobs as a result of the funding deal\n\nPort Talbot's steelworks will be given up to £500m by the UK government in a bid to keep the plant open and produce steel in a greener way, but it could see thousands lose their jobs.\n\nTata Steel will add £700m of its own as it invests in cutting emissions. It had asked ministers to provide a bigger chunk of the cost.\n\nBut the package could mean as many as 3,000 job losses across the UK.\n\nThe site in south Wales is home to Britain's biggest steelworks.\n\nThe steelworks features two blast furnaces working around the clock to produce steel used in everything from tin cans to cars.\n\nBut it is also one of the UK's largest polluters.\n\nThe UK government has agreed to fund the installation of new electric arc furnaces for steelmaking.\n\nThe £1.25bn furnaces are expected to be up and running within three years of getting regulatory and planning approvals.\n\nThe company warned there would be a \"transition period including potential deep restructuring\" at the plant.\n\nThe UK government said the deal \"has the potential to safeguard over 5,000 jobs across the UK\".\n\nTata Steel employs about 8,000 people in the UK, 4,000 of those in Port Talbot.\n\nThe site in Port Talbot is the biggest steelworks in Britain\n\nUnions previously said the move to the new less labour-intensive furnaces could lead to thousands of job losses.\n\nThe UK government said the transition was expected to reduce the UK's entire business and industry carbon emissions by 7%, Wales's overall emissions by 22% and the Port Talbot site's emissions by 85%.\n\nIt also said the plan to replace existing coal-powered blast furnaces at the site would \"reduce the UK's entire carbon emissions by around 1.5%\".\n\nFor the government and the UK steel sector the £500m support package for Port Talbot's steelworks is an important intervention that secures an industry whose future, finances and emissions are unsustainable.\n\nAnd, as government officials point out, it is much less than the £1.5bn Tata originally said was needed to save Port Talbot from possible closure.\n\nFor the Labour Party, it's another example of a hotchpotch, patchwork of last-minute deals that are a poor substitute for a coherent industrial strategy. The worst possible combination of spending hundreds of millions while costing thousands of jobs.\n\nFor the workers and unions, it's a terrible outcome of a process that they have not been involved with or consulted upon, with a result that will leave the UK still reliant on imports of the kinds of steel these new proposed furnaces cannot supply.\n\nRead more of Simon's analysis: UK now forced to act in a global subsidy war\n\nKemi Badenoch, business and trade secretary for the UK government, called the deal \"an historic package of support from the UK government\".\n\nAsked whether the job losses were a price worth paying, she said: \"That's completely the wrong way to look at it.\n\n\"We are saving jobs which would have been lost.

Littler, who turns 17 in three days, was the youngest PDC World Championship finalist earlier in January. He faces fellow Englishman Nathan Aspinall in the last eight, after the World Matchplay champion edged past the Philippines' Lourence Ilagan 6-5. The winner of the tournament will collect a top prize of £20,000.\n\nThursday's first round pits eight players from the PDC circuit against eight players from Asia in best-of-11 leg matches. The quarter-finals, semi-finals, and final are all scheduled to take place on Friday. Littler, who has had some time off since his exploits at Alexandra Palace, missed three attempts at double five in the first leg as he went 2-0 down. However, he then reeled off five consecutive legs before sealing his victory against the world number 126. Meanwhile, new world champion Luke Humphries extended his 19-match winning run with a resounding 6-0 victory over the host nation's Abdulla Saeed. The world number one has also won the World Grand Prix, Grand Slam of Darts and Players Championship Finals in recent months and is bidding to lift his fifth televised title in the space of six events.

And even if they did, they should have impacted far away from any population.\n\nAstrobotic's goal had been to deliver five Nasa instruments to the Moon's surface, to study the local environment ahead of the return of astronauts later this decade.\n\nHad the Peregrine craft been able to land successfully, it would have become the first American mission in half a century to do so, and the first ever private venture to achieve the feat.\n\nOnly government agencies from the US, the Soviet Union, China and India have managed controlled lunar landings to date.\n\nBut Astrobotic's mission was in trouble almost as soon as it came off the top of its launch rocket on Monday 8 January. It can, though, console itself with what it did manage to accomplish in difficult circumstances by continuing to operate Peregrine in space for more than 10 days.\n\nArtwork: How Astrobotic envisioned Peregrine on the lunar surface\n\nEngineers were able to diagnose what went wrong with Peregrine and then eke out life in the lander far beyond what seemed possible at the start.\n\n\"Space exploration is a learning game, especially at this stage and we shouldn't look at this as a failure; we should look at this as an incredible engineering success,\" Sian Cleaver, Airbus' Orion European Service Module industrial manager, told the BBC's Today Programme.\n\n\"At one point it was looking like this mission was doomed, but a team of engineers and scientists managed to work together and to problem solve and to restore some capabilities of the spacecraft and ultimately direct it back to Earth,\" she said. \"I think that's actually pretty impressive.\"\n\n\"There's a lot that we can take away from this, but ultimately space travel is difficult and we're seeing that here.\"\n\nThe fault was traced to leaking propellant from a ruptured oxidiser tank. This was generating a thrust, turning the craft and preventing it from keeping its solar panels constantly pointed at the Sun - vital to maintain a power supply.\n\nAstrobotic posted a video on social media showing the spacecraft's view of Earth before it burned up.\n\nThe Astrobotic team worked the thrusters on Peregrine to restore stable pointing, but this of course used up even more of the rapidly depleting oxidiser.\n\nNonetheless, payloads onboard were activated, proving their space-worthiness, and some were even able to gather data, such as on the nature of the radiation environment between Earth and the Moon.\n\nOne of the Nasa instruments to be started up - the Peregrine Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (PITMS) - had its sensor and electronics developed in the UK by the Open University and RAL Space.\n\nThe instrument was reported to be performing well in the check-out tests. The technology should have the opportunity to fly again on later lunar missions.\n\nIntuitive Machines is the next US company to attempt a soft-landing on the Moon\n\nAstrobotic is the first of three US companies to send a lander to the Moon this year under a new private-public partnership with Nasa.\n\nThe agency is buying transport services from the Pittsburgh firm and two other commercial ventures - Intuitive Machines and Firefly. Together, the trio had planned six missions to the lunar surface in 2024.\n\nAstrobotic should get a second go in the back half of the year when it tries to land a Nasa rover called Viper. Houston-based Intuitive Machines' first attempt is likely to launch next month. Its Nova-C craft will be aimed at the lunar south pole.\n\nBefore then, the Japanese space agency will try to put down safely close to a near-equatorial impact crater called Shioli.

Pakistan had earlier recalled its ambassador and blocked the Iranian envoy from returning.\n\nChina, Turkey and the Taliban government in Afghanistan have all called for restraint and dialogue.\n\nEarlier in the week Iran also attacked targets in Iraq and Syria.

Islamabad had a strong incentive to try to restore deterrence, especially with Iran on the offensive around the wider region deploying direct strikes and proxies to hit out at threats and rivals. In effect, if Pakistan had held back, it would have faced the risk of additional strikes,\" he said.\n\nOthers suggested that the government in Islamabad was under domestic pressure to respond. The country, which saw its former leader Imran Khan removed nearly two years ago, is holding an election next month.\n\n\"There was a lot of public pressure on the government to do something and so they have done this just to prove that they are not less than [Iran], this act of sabre-rattling,\" said retired Lt General Asif Yaseen, a former Pakistani defence secretary.\n\nBut he said he had a \"gut feeling that this will stop here for both the countries\" and Pakistan could now be in a position to restart dialogue with Iran.\n\nIranian missiles - seen here during a training drill - have hit Pakistan, Iraq and Syria in recent days\n\nSome commentators have suggested Iran's strikes on Iraq, Syria and Pakistan this week were also driven by the current turbulent dynamics in the Middle East.\n\nTehran has said it does not want to get involved in the wider Israel-Gaza conflict, but groups that it backs have been targeting Israel and its allies to show solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nHowever, Shashank Joshi, defence editor at The Economist, said he does not believe the strikes are an outcome of the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, which killed about 1,200 people and triggered Israeli retaliation against Hamas in Gaza, which officials from the Hamas-run health ministry there say has killed about 24,000 people.\n\n\"The story here is about Iran flexing its muscles, perhaps outraged by what it saw as a grievous assault on its country,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, referring to the deadly bomb attack in Kerman earlier this month, which he described as \"the worst terrorist attack in Iran since the revolution of 1979\".\n\n\"Iran is wounded and is lashing out. I don't think there's any compelling reason to say the bombing was caused by, or is an outcome of 7 October,\" he said.\n\nHe adds that this is \"not the first time there have been border tensions, but it is by far and away the most serious escalation in tensions that I can remember\".\n\nCorrection 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final."}

The bombers targeted crowds gathered near the tomb of Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani to mark the fourth anniversary of his assassination in a US drone strike.\n\nThe IRGC said it used a Kheibar Shekan (Castle Buster) missile, which can travel up to 1,450km (900 miles), to target Idlib.\n\nIt also said the missile was launched from the southern province of Khuzestan, even though it could have done so from the western province of Azerbaijan, which is much closer to Syria.\n\nThe choice of missile and launch location suggest that Iran wants to convey to the world its ability to reach various locations in Israel, which borders Syria."}

More than 900 sub-postmasters and postmistresses were prosecuted for theft and false accounting from 1999 to 2015 based on Horizon evidence.\n\nIt has been described as the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice.\n\nMr Castleton's branch was found to have a £25,000 shortfall and he was subsequently suspended following an audit almost 20 years ago.

They're wrong.\"\n\nHe asked: \"So will the government give further serious thought to blocking large companies like Fujitsu with terrible track records from bidding for future contracts?

However, the Post Office carried on with the prosecutions.\n\nAt a hearing before MPs, Mr Patterson also said that Fujitsu had a \"moral obligation\" to contribute to compensation for sub-postmasters wrongly prosecuted as a result of its faulty software.\n\nOn Thursday, Fujitsu Group, which is based in Japan, said that it would \"be working with the UK government on the appropriate actions, including contribution to compensation\".\n\n\"The Fujitsu Group hopes for a swift resolution that ensures a just outcome for the victims,\" it added."}

The couple had two sons, William and Harry. They later separated and their marriage was dissolved in 1996. On 31 August 1997, the princess was killed in a car crash in Paris.\n\nHe married Camilla Parker Bowles on 9 April 2005. When Charles became King, she became Queen Consort, as per the wishes of the late queen. Following the coronation she is now known as Queen Camilla.\n\nPrince William is the elder son of King Charles III and Diana, Princess of Wales, and is now first in line to the throne.\n\nHe was 15 when his mother died. He went on to study at the University of St Andrews, where he met his future wife, Kate Middleton. The couple were married in 2011.\n\nOn his 21st birthday he was appointed a Counsellor of State - standing in for the late queen on official occasions. He and his wife had their first child, George, in July 2013, their second, Charlotte, in 2015 and third, Louis, in 2018.\n\nThe prince trained with the Army, Royal Navy and RAF before spending three years as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot with RAF Valley on Anglesey, north Wales. He also worked part-time for two years as a co-pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance alongside his royal duties. He left the role in July 2017 to take on more royal duties on behalf of his grandparents.\n\nWilliam inherited the Duchy of Cornwall estate from his father and is now the Prince of Wales.

Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor - to be known as Lili - is named after the Royal Family's nickname for the late queen.\n\nShe was given the middle name Diana in honour of Prince Harry's mother, who died in a car crash in 1997 when he was 12 years old. Like her brother, she gained the right to use the royal title when her grandfather became king.\n\nPrince Andrew, eighth in line to the throne, was the third child of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip - but the first to be born to a reigning monarch for 103 years.\n\nHe was created the Duke of York on his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, who became Duchess of York, in 1986. They had two daughters - Beatrice, in 1988, and Eugenie, in 1990. In March 1992 it was announced the duke and duchess were to separate. They divorced in 1996.\n\nThe duke served for 22 years in the Royal Navy and saw active service in the Falklands War in 1982. In addition to royal engagements, he served as a special trade representative for the government until 2011.\n\nPrince Andrew stepped away from royal duties in 2019 after an interview with the BBC about his relationship with US financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges.\n\nIn February 2022, the duke agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to settle a civil sexual assault case brought against him in the US by one of Epstein's victims, although he made no admission of liability and had repeatedly denied the allegations.\n\nPrincess Beatrice is the elder daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York.

He was given the title after his father Prince Edward became the Duke of Edinburgh in March 2023.

It is thought his parents made this decision to avoid some of the burdens of royal titles.\n\nBorn in 2003, Lady Louise Windsor is the elder child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. However, she is lower in the line of succession than her younger brother because she was born before a law came into force scrapping the system that meant a younger son could displace an older daughter.\n\nAnne, Princess Royal is Elizabeth II and Prince Philip's second child and only daughter.

Instead of being sacked in 1973 after the first allegations against him emerged, British Transport Police (BTP) moved him to another team.\n\nThis morning, Lord Justice Holroyde - one of the most senior judges in England and Wales - said both the men were innocent and posthumously quashed their convictions.\n\n\"We cannot turn back the clock,\" said the judge. \"But we can, and do, quash the convictions.\"\n\nRidgewell's framing of the two men was not referred back to judges to be reconsidered until now - and was only uncovered thanks to work on another of the officer's victims by the official miscarriages review body.\n\nRegu Saliah, Mr Mehmet's oldest son, said: \"This judgment today brings some relief from an injustice that has lasted nearly half a century and for this we would like to thank our legal team and the Criminal Cases Review Commission for making it possible.\n\n\"Regrettably, our father doesn't get to experience this judgment today, he passed away two years ago having lived as a victim of Ridgewell, a corrupt, racist police officer for over 43 years.\n\n\"What he was put through over those years left a traumatic legacy that stayed with him his whole life.\n\n\"The injustice he suffered he never managed to comprehend - but even harder for him was knowing that his incarceration left my mother and I penniless and homeless in 1970s London.\"\n\nDerek Ridgewell admitted theft and died in jail in 1982\n\nJanice Peterkin, Mr Peterkin's daughter, said she had been determined to clear her father's name.\n\n\"He didn't deserve to spend time in prison,\" she said.\n\n\"He was a law-abiding citizen and a family man. Basil was unfairly targeted and framed by the ex-policeman Ridgewell who was clearly racist and corrupt.\n\n\"Our dad was not given the chance to prove his innocence either at trial or when he appealed.\"\n\nThe long battle to clear the men has raised questions about how police forces investigate their own officers after an allegation of corruption has been proven.\n\nIn 2021, BTP said they had completed a search for any other potential wrongful convictions linked to Ridgewell - but did not submit the 1977 case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, the body that investigates potential miscarriages of justice.\n\n\"As a family we find it extremely difficult to understand why BTP failed to initiate a review into my father's case when Ridgewell was convicted so soon after,\" said Regu Saliah.\n\n\"We are bitterly disappointed that to this day we have had no contact from the BTP to explain their actions and, more importantly, their inactions regarding what we consider to be a crime perpetrated against our father, and by extension us as a family.\"\n\nMr Matt Foot, the men's solicitor from miscarriages campaign group Appeal, said their case showed the law must be changed to prevent other such injustices.\n\nHe and the families are now calling for an automatic review of the corrupt officer's case files to avoid the same mistake being made again.\n\n\"There is no excuse for the hideous delay of nearly 50 years,\" said Mr Foot.\n\n\"We need [Justice Secretary] Alex Chalk to introduce an immediate change in the law so that miscarriages of justice caused by corrupt police officers like Ridgewell are swiftly put right.\"\n\nIn 2021 BTP apologised for what it said had been Ridgewell's \"systemic racism\".\n\nChief Constable Lucy D'Orsi, said: \"I am sincerely sorry for the trauma suffered by the British African community through the criminal actions of former police officer DS Derek Ridgewell who worked in BTP during the 1960s and '70s.\n\n\"In particular, it is of regret that we did not act sooner to end his criminalisation of British Africans, which led to the conviction of innocent people.\n\n\"This is simply inexcusable and is something that my colleagues and I are appalled by.\"\n\nThe BBC is", "continuation": " not responsible for the content of external sites."}

He is expected to hold talks with Palestinian officials in the occupied West Bank and Israeli leaders.\n\nHis visit comes amid heightened tensions in the region following the assassination of top Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri on Tuesday in Lebanon's capital Beirut. His killing has widely been blamed on Israel. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement.\n\nUnder Mr Gallant's now \"four corner\" plan, Israel would retain overall security control of Gaza.\n\nA multi-national force would take charge of rebuilding the territory after the widespread destruction caused by Israeli bombing.\n\nNeighbouring Egypt would also have an unspecified role to play under the plan.\n\nBut the document adds that Palestinians would be responsible for running the territory.\n\n\"Gaza residents are Palestinian, therefore Palestinian bodies will be in charge, with the condition that there will be no hostile actions or threats against the State of Israel,\" Mr Gallant said.\n\nThe plan was not discussed in any detail in the cabinet meeting and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly commented on it.

That trial was based on his 2022 remarks that her story was a \"con job\" and a \"hoax\".\n\nThe current case focuses on different remarks - which the judge has already ruled were defamatory - that Mr Trump made while he was president in 2019, when he called her allegation \"totally false\". This second trial will determine additional damages.\n\nBut much of Wednesday's proceedings were marked by angry exchanges between Mr Trump and the judge, who threatened to revoke the former president's right to attend trial after a lawyer for Ms Carroll heard him call the case a \"witch hunt\" and criticise his accuser's memory within earshot of the jury.\n\n\"Mr Trump has a right to be present here,\" Judge Kaplan said, frustration evident in his voice. \"That right can be forfeited and it can be forfeited if he is disruptive, which is what has been reported to me, and if he disregards court orders.\"\n\n\"Mr Trump,\" he continued. \"I hope I don't have to consider excluding you from the trial. I understand you're probably eager for me to do that.\"\n\n\"I would love it,\" the former president replied. \"I understand you're probably very eager for me to do that because you just can't control yourself in these circumstances,\" Judge Kaplan barked back.\n\nIn all his years of bomb throwing and political attacks, Mr Trump has rarely had to face the subjects of his ire. But on Wednesday, aside from those comments, he was forced to remain silent as Ms Carroll told a jury how he had damaged her reputation.\n\nIn 2019, she alleged Mr Trump forced himself on her after a chance encounter decades earlier inside the luxury Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan.\n\n\"I am here because Donald Trump assaulted me, and when I wrote about it, he said it never happened,\" Ms Carroll, 80, said. \"He lied, and it shattered my reputation.\"\n\nAfter building a 50-year career as a journalist, she told the court: \"now I'm known as a liar, a fraud and a whack job\".\n\n\"I am here to get my reputation back and to stop him from telling lies about me.\"\n\nE Jean Carroll told the court Trump \"lied, and it shattered my reputation\"\n\nLawyers for Ms Carroll displayed a series of death threats, rape threats and insults she says she has received since coming forward.\n\nOne message told her to \"stick a gun in your mouth and pull the trigger\", while another called her a \"Satan worshipping Nazi\" - abuse, she said, that left her fearful.\n\nIn the light of these safety concerns, Ms Carroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, asked her client about a photo showing her smiling next to a man in a rubber Trump mask as she walked past Trump Tower in Manhattan.\n\nMs Carroll said she felt safe there because of the large police presence.\n\nSitting two rows back with his legal team, Mr Trump listened intently, staring at Ms Carroll and shaking his head at one point.\n\nDuring cross-examination, his lawyers went on the attack. Alina Habba - Mr Trump's attorney - tried to make the case that Ms Carroll wanted fame, citing her multiple television and podcast appearances to talk about her book and the allegations.\n\nShe said Ms Carroll continues to give interviews about the case she won last year. \"After all those appearances, you want to gain more publicity don't you?\" Ms Habba asked.\n\nMs Carroll responded that she had her fill of that, adding that she did not like saying Mr Trump's name but interviewers always wanted to ask about him.\n\nTrump attorney Alina Habba clashed repeatedly with the judge on Wednesday\n\nAs the court returned for its afternoon session, the tension between Mr Trump, his legal team, and the judge resumed after they asked Mr Kaplan, a Clinton appointee, to recuse himself for \"general hostility toward the defence\". The motion was denied.\n\nMs Habba repeatedly clashed with the judge as the day wore on. She asked for the trial to be delayed so Mr Trump could attend his mother-in-law's funeral on Thursday, saying it would be \"insanely prejudicial\" to have him sit in court.\n\n\"The application is denied. I will hear no further argument on it,\" Judge Kaplan said. \"None. Do you understand that word? None.\"\n\nThough the former president was deposed in the earlier trial, he did not attend in person or testify, both of which he is doing voluntarily in these proceedings.

By the end of the war there were 10 computers helping to decipher the Nazi messages.\n\nFitted with 2,500 valves and standing at more than 2 metres tall, Colossus required a team of skilled operators and technicians to run and maintain it.\n\nOften they were members of the Women's Royal Naval Service (Wrens) - one of the new images shows Wrens working on the machine.\n\nBlueprints of its inner workings have also been made public for the first time, along with a letter referring to \"rather alarming German instructions\" intercepted by Colossus, as well as an audio clip of the machine at work.\n\nBy the end of the war, 63 million characters of high grade German messages had been decrypted by the 550 people working on the computers.\n\nOne of its notable successes was helping the Allies know that Hitler had swallowed the bait that the D-Day landings in June 1944 would be at Calais rather than Normandy.\n\nHistorians think the computers shortened the war and saved many lives.\n\nDespite its huge impact, engineers and codebreakers who had worked on the Colossus programme were sworn to secrecy and the existence of this vital piece of machinery was kept from the history books for almost six decades.\n\nColossus wasn't formally acknowledged by the UK intelligence services until the 2000's.\n\nAfter the war eight of the 10 computers were destroyed.\n\nThe engineer who designed it, Tommy Flowers, was ordered to hand over all documentation on the machinery to GCHQ.\n\nThe attempts to keep it secret were so succ", "continuation": "essful that Bill Marshall, a former GCHQ engineer who worked on Colossus in the 1960s, said he had no idea about its wartime role.\n\nHe said he was now \"very proud to have been involved with Colossus even in just a small way.\"\n\nAndrew Herbert, chairman of trustees at the National Museum of Computing, which is based at Bletchley Park, said the release of the images was another opportunity to celebrate the lasting impact Colossus had had.\n\n\"From a technical perspective, Colossus was an important precursor of the modern electronic digital computer,\" he said.\n\n\"Many of those who used Colossus at Bletchley Park went on to become important pioneers and leaders of British computing in the decades following the war, often leading the world in their work\", he added."}

It's a special day.\"\n\nShortly after Henderson's departure was confirmed, it was announced that ex-Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard had extended his deal as Al-Ettifaq manager until 2027.\n\n'Everyone tried and no one is to blame'\n\nAs a prominent supporter of the LGBTQ+ community during his time at Anfield, Henderson was criticised for making the move to Saudi Arabia, where same-sex sexual activity is illegal.\n\nHe said he was \"really hurt\" by the backlash, adding his intention has always been to \"help causes and communities\".\n\nHowever, recent reports suggested Henderson had failed to settle in Saudi Arabia; he leaves Al-Ettifaq having made just 17 league appearances.\n\nBBC Sport was told the split between the Saudi Pro League and Henderson was amicable, and the financial implications of his departure are said to be \"positive\" for the Saudis.\n\nAl-Ettifaq president Samer Al Misehal said: \"Firstly, the club would like to thank Jordan for his efforts and wish him the best for his future endeavours.\n\n\"We are always respectful of our players. The club and Jordan believe this quick decision, without any delay or further distraction, has been made for both the overall good of the club and for Jordan.\"\n\nSaad Allazeez, the vice-chairman and interim chief executive of the Saudi Pro League, added: \"This is all just part of football, all across the world and life, across all careers.\n\n\"Sometimes, despite best efforts, people don't always adjust or settle and that can impact performances and lead to frustrations for all.\n\n\"Jordan is a good guy and it's a shame that things didn't work out for him, but he'd be the first to admit that full support was given to him and respect shown. So everyone tried and no one is to blame.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I'm pleased the club acted fast as they have to protect their own interests as well as the player and this instance, this is all for the best.\n\n\"Since their financial conditions for cancelling the contract were agreed, they can now make full use of the winter break and transfer window to reset and go again.\n\n\"And as a league, we have the strength and depth to move forward.\"\n\nAjax, who have endured a difficult campaign so far, are 23 points behind leaders PSV Eindhoven in the Eredivisie.\n\n\"We wanted an experienced midfielder with leadership qualities,\" said Ajax boss John van 't Schip.\n\n\"Partially due to injuries in the team, we were looking for someone who could step in immediately. Jordan Henderson is that type of player.\"\n\nHenderson began his career at hometown club Sunderland before joining Liverpool in 2011 in a deal reported to be worth £20m.\n\nHe played 492 times for the Reds, scoring 33 goals and registering 57 assists, and won seven major trophies with the club.\n\nVan 't Schip added: \"His arrival means a huge enhancement for our squad. Both on and off the pitch, a football player of this calibre is important for our many young players.\n\n\"He's an English international player and has won the Champions League and many other prizes with Liverpool. I am happy he's here, and I think it's very good for our club.\"\n\n'It will take time to win back trust of gay community'\n\nHenderson will have to earn back the trust of the LGBTQ+ community, says Sven Kistner, board member of Queer Football Fan Clubs. The organisation, which has around 1,200 members, is a network for European gay and lesbian supporters.\n\n\"He could and should have known better before, but he didn't and now he's coming back,\" Kistner said. \"I think he might again play a good role for our community, but it will take some time until the trust in him is back. It will need some effo", "continuation": "rt from his side to get this reputation back.\"\n\nFans may give Henderson a frosty reception when he plays for Ajax.\n\n\"I think he will go through some tough times still with the LGBT+ community,\" added Kistner. \"He was kind of an icon, a role model to many of the community, but then he decided to leave for Saudi Arabia - it is not the US or Japan, or even China. It is Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"I think that was not very well received by the community, which is absolutely understandable. When he was there, he noticed quite soon that it is not the best place to be.\n\n\"Also from a football point of view, because if in 80% of the cases, you play with a stadium which is only 2% occupied, it's not really fun for a player as well.\"\n\nSome will see Jordan Henderson's exit after just six months - despite having a hugely lucrative contract ripped up - as a setback for the Saudi Pro League, and ask whether it could signal the start of a number of high-profile departures.\n\nWhile Al-Ettifaq and league officials are emphasising that the parting of ways was amicable, and can now reinvest the money Henderson would have earned, the club president has also admitted the news was a \"disappointing end to the relationship\".\n\nHowever, Saudi officials also point out that more than 90 players arrived in the summer as part of a £750m spending spree and they always anticipated that not all would work out. With the low attendances at some matches, the adjusting to the climate, and the difficult ethical questions that some players (such as Henderson) have faced over going to Saudi Arabia, it is no surprise if some have had second thoughts.\n\nHenderson is a big name, but there are plenty of other players in Saudi Arabia that league bosses would be more concerned about keeping. Karim Benzema for instance, who is understood to be unhappy with the quality of his Al-Ittihad team amid a difficult first season there.\n\nFrom the Saudi perspective, the news that Steven Gerrard has extended his stay as head coach at Al-Ettifaq will soften the blow of Henderson's departure, and provide a timely response to those doubting the Pro League's pulling power. And with stars such as Ronaldo, Neymar, Ruben Neves and N'Golo Kante appearing to enjoy life in the kingdom, there seems little fear that this could be the start of an exodus as the Pro League tries to establish itself among the top footballing competitions in the world."}

But it was the absence of defeat.\n\nNo-one outside Westminster will cheer a bill passing what's called third reading.\n\nSome, such as Labour, the Liberal Democrats and others, will maintain that the policy is ridiculous.\n\nAnd its advocates and others will - and do still - ask all the same questions, and don't get st", "continuation": "raight answers, not least the big one: will any migrants actually be sent to Rwanda before the general election?\n\nRishi Sunak doesn't offer a straight answer to that question because he can't. He is not in control of the House of Lords or the courts, and they both could gum up his plan to get a plane off to Kigali soon.\n\nBut Mr Sunak didn't seek to use this moment to change the record and talk about something else. Instead he wanted to continue talking about illegal immigration, and turn his focus to Labour.\n\nThere has been a deep frustration within Downing Street at the government's relative inability to do this, such has been the noise from their own side.\n\nThat said, I didn't manage to tempt the ever-disciplined prime minister to offer any public criticism of his bickering backbenchers when I got the chance to ask him a question.\n\nIn taking the political tussle to Labour he repeatedly used the phrase \"back to square one\" to describe how he thought Keir Starmer would handle the issue - and tried to draw a dividing line between his willingness to slog on with his Rwanda idea, and Labour's commitment to ditch it.\n\nInstead, as he also said repeatedly, he would \"stick to the plan\".\n\nThat phrase is an illustration of the latest about turn in the Conservatives' campaigning strategy.\n\nHaving briefly pitched himself, at the Conservative conference in the autumn, as an agent of change, he has now switched to the more conventional electoral approach of a party long in government: stick with the folk you know, don't trust the other lot.\n\nThe thing is, having tried change and continuity, the opinion polls remain dire for the Tories. The political story of 2023 was Rishi Sunak's inability to budge the polls.\n\nJust this week there has been a YouGov polls for The Times and the Daily Telegraph, which both look desperate from No10's perspective.\n\nThis piles gloom on top of bad blood for many Conservatives, fearful for their jobs while also irritated either at the behaviour of their rebellious colleagues or at the way the government has handled things.\n\nYet again there are mutters that a handful of Tory MPs have submitted letters calling for a vote of confidence in Rishi Sunak.\n\nOnly one Conservative MP has publicly acknowledged they have done this - Dame Andrea Jenkyns.\n\nAnd talk of further letters should be treated with a decent dose of scepticism, because proving they have, unless an MP publishes their letter, is almost impossible.\n\nNonetheless all this is the backdrop against which the prime minister is attempting to seize the initiative in a general election year: it is not remotely easy for him."}

So far very few Conservative MPs have explicitly committed to voting against the bill.\n\nAt least four Conservative MPs - including former ministers Robert Jenrick and Suella Braverman - have publicly said they are prepared to vote against the bill if it is not improved.\n\nBut it is unclear how many more could join them.\n\nIllegal Migration Minister Michael Tomlinson told BBC Breakfast the Tory rebellion against the policy was a sign of \"constructive and robust debate\".\n\nPlaying down the scale of Conservative divisions, he said: \"Almost every single person, in fact every single person, who stood up on our side on the Conservative side said they want this scheme to work\".\n\nMr Tomlinson said he was \"very sorry\" that two party deputy chairmen and a parliamentary private secretary resigned, but that \"each and every one of them want this policy to work\".\n\nHe said there was only \"an inch between us on the Conservative benches\".\n\nThe illegal migration minister also confirmed the government was \"looking at\" new rules for civil servants, to make it the default assumption that orders from international courts temporarily blocking flights to Rwanda should be ignored.\n\nThe FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, is already pushing back against the idea - saying it will mean officials will be asked to breach international law.\n\nOn Tuesday, tabled amendments to the bill - which aimed to prevent any international law being used to block someone's removal to Rwanda and severely limit an individual's ability to appeal their deportation - were defeated.\n\nBut they still secured significant backing from senior Tories, including former home secretary Mrs Braverman and former prime minister Liz Truss.\n\nMr Sunak has so far resisted giving in to the demands of his critics on the right of the party - and if he did, this could risk losing support among more centrist MPs.\n\nHowever, in a bid to appease some of these critics, the government is considering changing the Civil Service Code to include a presumption emergency injunctions from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg are ignored.\n\nThe move is part of an attempt to quell the Conservative rebellion over Mr Sunak's Rwanda legislation.\n\nEven a government victory would come at a political cost, with debates over the issue exposing the extent of divisions within the Conservative Party.\n\nA significant rebellion would also be damaging to the prime minister, who has made the Rwanda policy central to his pledge to stop small boats crossing the Channel.\n\nMiriam Cates, one of those who voted for Tuesday's amendments, told the BBC she would \"potentially\" be prepared to vote against the entire bill.\n\n\"But we've got 24 hour", "continuation": "s - that's a long time in politics.

A family learned of a death by being asked about an autopsy.\n\n\"One adult victim was placed on a walkway on the ground outside to be attended to - she died,\" Ms Gupta said.\n\nIt became the third-deadliest US school shooting ever, just behind 2007's Virginia Tech and 2012's Sandy Hook mass killings.\n\nMuch of the blame for the confused and slow response was put on Pete Arredondo, Uvalde's former school police chief.\n\n\"He did not provide appropriate leadership, command, and control,\" the report said, adding his \"failures may have been influenced by policy and training deficiencies\".\n\nFamilies of the Uvalde victims listened as justice department officials described the multiple failures\n\nMr Arredondo left his radio behind, and had to communicate with his team either verbally or over a cell phone, the report said.\n\nThe Justice Department will not be bringing any charges, as it does not have jurisdiction, Mr Garland said,\n\nIt conducted its investigation to provide clarity around the circumstances that led to the large loss of life and to provide guidance for responding to future shootings.\n\nFormer Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin had requested the federal probe after state officials provided conflicting accounts about what happened. Residents in the small Texas town of roughly 15,000 waited 20 months for the final report.\n\nThe justice department relied on more than 14,000 pieces of data and 260 intervie", "continuation": "ws, Ms Gupta said.\n\nMr Garland visited families in Uvalde on Wednesday and stopped by the town's murals of victim.

{"context": "Raducanu was playing in only the second tournament of her comeback\n\nCoverage: Commentary every day from 07:00 GMT on Tennis Breakfast on Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, with selected live text commentaries and match reports on the BBC Sport website and app\n\nEmma Raducanu says there was \"no way\" she was going to quit in her Grand Slam comeback as she battled valiantly before losing at the Australian Open. Britain's Raducanu, 21, was beaten 6-4 4-6 6-4 by China's Wang Yafan in a second-round match where she was \"throwing up\" in her mouth. Raducanu was playing only her fourth match after wrist and ankle surgeri", "continuation": "es which kept her out for eight months. \"Everything I went through last year has made me so much tougher,\" she said. \"There was no way I was going to pull out. She was going to have to beat me - and she did.\" Raducanu's exit came after Katie Boulter, who has taken over as British number one, lost to Chinese 12th seed Zheng Qinwen on the same Kia Arena court. They were bidding to set up an all-British meeting in the third round, but instead it is the Chinese pair who will meet on Saturday. The defeats for Raducanu and Boulter mean there are no British players left in the women's singles. Cameron Norrie, who fought back from two sets down to win in five sets earlier on Thursday, is the only remaining player from the nation in the singles draws.\n\nFor any player coming back from such a long absence, it takes time to reach match sharpness and patience with their progress will be required. With Raducanu, given the long list of physical and mental struggles she has endured since winning the 2021 US Open, even more caution is necessary. Therefore it was unsurprising - but not necessarily worrying - to see Raducanu suffer in the deciding set of an intense battle with 94th-ranked Wang. Raducanu looked like she was going to be sick early in the third set and had her blood pressure checked by a doctor. Despite that, she had chances to break back in the decider but Wang held on. Afterwards, Raducanu alleviated any concerns by saying she thought it was a stomach bug. \"All of a sudden I just felt so sick, really like weak and nauseous. Throughout the third set I think everyone could see it was a bit of a battle,\" she said. \"Physically, I felt fine. It was more I was throwing up in my mouth. Now I'm OK, I'll get over it. \"It just sucks with the timing.\"\n\nThe way she scrapped throughout a three-hour contest, and showed glimpses of her undoubted quality, was encouraging and admirable. In a testing breeze, Wang played precisely and smartly in the first set as Raducanu was made to pay for a slow start. The former British number one was unable to recover from going a double break down and lost serve again in the first game of the second set. When Raducanu faced two more break points at 1-1, it felt as though Wang's solidity would be enough to win in straight sets. But there was plenty to admire about Raducanu's response. She managed to increase her level, put an extra spring in her step, and immediately broke back for 2-2 at the fifth attempt. When Wang again served into the wind at 4-3 down, Raducanu stuck in another baseline duel and finished off a 24-shot rally with a crosscourt forehand winner to move a break up. Getting over the line was difficult. But competing on the biggest stages of all is where Raducanu wants to be and she showed her resilience. Raducanu missed two set points on her own serve, but took a fourth opportunity in the next game to force a decider. Both players took a breather before the third set started and Raducanu handed over an early advantage by missing a forehand which she would expect to put away. Then came the breathing difficulties and feeling nauseous. When she trailed 2-0, she required an assessment from the doctor and the prescribing of some tablets. Still Raducanu refused to give in. Four more break points came and went for the Briton before Wang served out to reach a Grand Slam third round for the first time."}

The bodies of those killed by Israel are often wrapped in the flags of movements supported by friends or family members - even when the deceased are not supporters themselves.\n\nRelatives and neighbours all told us the men had no connection with militant groups - as did the head of Jenin's main hospital, Wissam Bakr, where the bodies were brought that morning.\n\nIbtesam Asous had not expected all four of her sons to die\n\n\"They are not armed, they are not fighters,\" he said. \"Normally, it's clear from the people if he's a fighter with one of the militant groups. These seven? No, no, it's sure, all of them are civilians.\"\n\nIt was at the hospital that the men's mother, Ibtesam Asous, saw her sons' bodies.\n\n\"They were all gone,\" she said. \"I expected that one of them might have been martyred, but not all four of them. I was shocked when I saw that they had all been killed.\"\n\nWe asked the Israeli army to explain why this group of men was targeted.\n\nA spokesperson replied that soldiers had begun pursuing the \"terrorists who murdered an Israeli citize", "continuation": "n\" and that the air strike targeted \"a terrorist squad that hurled explosives at the forces operating in the area, putting them in danger\".\n\nHours before the air strike in al-Shuhada, a 19-year-old border policewoman, Shai Germai, was killed when her vehicle hit an explosive device during clashes with Palestinian fighters in Jenin Camp.\n\nAfterwards, the army convoy withdrew from Jenin through al-Shuhada, where the Darweesh brothers had gathered with their three distant relatives, near an all-night coffee shop popular with agricultural workers and customers for the nearby dawn vegetable market.\n\nNight-vision drone footage provided by the IDF shows small flashes followed by an explosion as vehicles pass along the road - a heat pattern that could be produced by a petrol bomb. The video does not have a date-stamp or time-stamp.\n\nThe army also provided similar footage of its air strike on the location - but the two pieces of video are cut and edited together, making it impossible to tell how much time passed between them.\n\nWe asked the IDF to clarify the timings of both events. It replied that it would not be providing any more comment or information.\n\nThe timing is important, because of the circumstances needed under international law to justify using lethal force.\n\nThe UN's human rights body described the situation in the West Bank at the end of last year as \"alarming and urgent\".\n\n\"Israeli forces have increasingly used military tactics and weapons in law enforcement operations,\" a statement from its spokesperson said in November. \"Law enforcement is governed by international human rights law, which prohibits the intentional use of lethal force except when strictly necessary to protect life.\"\n\nIbtesam Asous, the men's mother, said she had seen a change in the methods used by Israeli forces in the West Bank since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October.\n\n\"They are acting just as they used to,\" she said. \"The only thing that changed is that, before, the army would shoot a guy in his leg. But now it's bigger - now they are bombing with rockets and killing as many people as they can.\"\n\nAccording to UN figures, last year was the bloodiest on record in the West Bank: 492 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces - 300 of them since the Hamas attacks in October, including 80 children.\n\nAlmost all were killed with live ammunition.\n\nTwenty-eight Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed in the West Bank by Palestinians last year - including three since the attacks in October, two of whom were soldiers.\n\nAttacks have also been carried out by Palestinians inside Israel, including one earlier this week that killed one woman and injured 17 other people.\n\nTwo witnesses who were in the coffee shop that morning told us that the army convoy left al-Shuhada between 04:00 and 04:45 local time (02:00-02:45 GMT), before the air strike took place, and that there were no clashes with local people.\n\n\"The soldiers passed four times and nobody approached them,\" one said. \"When the [vehicles] were fully outside the village, they bombed. Young men, sitting near a fire to stay warm, were hit with a rocket.\"\n\nAnother man told the BBC it was around an hour between the army leaving the village and the air strike happening around 05:00, and that many people in the coffee shop - including him - had left in between the two events.\n\nKhalid al-Ahmad, the paramedic from the Palestinian Red Crescent, remembers the Israeli army withdrawing from Jenin Camp in the early hours of the morning, and says it was \"almost 5am\" when he was called to the village after the strike.\n\nThe director at Jenin Hospital confirmed that the bodies had arrived there at around 05:15.\n\nCCTV footage from a nearby camera, part of which was filmed on a mobile phone by an unknown source, shows the 30 seconds immediately before the air strike, during which a car passes down the same stretch of empty road, apparently without incident. There is no time-stamp visible in the recording.\n\nA group of people - the Darweesh brothers and their relatives - can be seen standing and sitting around a fire. Then the air strike hits.\n\nSome of the brothers had been going to work, their mother said, while Hazza had been heading to an early morning dialysis appointment at Jenin Hospital.\n\nHe was worried that the military operation would block the road, she said, and wanted to leave early.\n\nThe hospital kidney unit confirmed that Hazza Darweesh had a regular 7am appointment for dialysis that day, and showed us his name on the schedule.\n\nA video taken by the brothers' uncle, Youssef Asous, shortly after the air strike shows bodies strewn across the ground.\n\nThe experienced Jenin paramedic, Khalid al-Ahmad, said he despaired of ever being able to forget the scene.\n\n\"They were kids without weapons,\" Youssef said. \"If they had weapons, I would have seen them. There were only the chairs they were sitting on.\"\n\n\"At the end of the day, anyone Palestinian is a target - if you are an armed person, then you are targeted; and if you are a civilian, then you are also a target.\"\n\nWe put all the allegations in this report to the IDF spokesperson, who repeated that the army had nothing more to add.\n\nIbtesam Asous visited the site of her children's deaths\n\nIbtesam Asous visited the site of the attack for the first time this week - her other children had tried to stop her coming, she said, but she had to see it for herself.\n\n\"I wanted to come and imagine where each of them was sitting,\" she explained, gesturing to different points on the ground as traffic thunders by.\n\n\"Alaa was there; Ahmad, Rami and Hazza were here. I wanted to see exactly where my sons were. It helps.\""}

I think we were six women,\" Lokko recalled.\n\n\"My first impression was, oh, there's not many people who are like me here, and I was unsure as to whether I had the right to be there.\n\n\"So I always understood diversity, not just about numbers and about policy, but also about the narratives and the stories and the experiences and the perspectives that people from diverse backgrounds could bring to architecture.\"\n\nLokko is also a best-selling novelist.

{"context": "Businessman Doug Barrowman is married to former Tory peer Baroness Michelle Mone\n\nThe husband of ex-Tory peer Michelle Mone is connected to a company that tax experts say should be investigated for fraud, BBC Newsnight has found.\n\nDoug Barrowman has previously denied involvement in Vanquish Options, a firm that falsely claimed customers could write off money owed to the government.\n\nBut BBC News has identified Vanquish bosses with links to Mr Barrowman and seen emails sent by Vanquish from the same IP address as his Isle of Man HQ.\n\nTax experts suggest there are grounds to open a criminal investigation into Vanquish Options.\n\nOne of Mr Barrowman's firms, PPE MedPro, is already being investigated by the National Crime Agency over contracts worth more than £200m to supply PPE to the NHS during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn March 2022, a company owned by Mr Barrowman, called AML Tax (UK) Limited, was fined £150,000 by a tax tribunal.\n\nHMRC, the UK's tax authority, said the firm was part of Mr Barrowman's Isle of Man-based Knox Group, and accused it of \"aggressively\" promoting tax avoidance schemes in the UK. HMRC referred to the firm as \"Doug Barrowman's tax avoidance firm\".\n\nHis company sold schemes to self-employed contractors in the 2010s, on the promise they could avoid UK income tax by having their earnings funnelled into an offshore trust.\n\nThe trust would then transfer the cash back to the contractor as a loan, which would supposedly never need to be repaid. Loans, unlike wages, are not subject to income tax. But the government clamped down on the schemes in 2016, bringing in new legislation.\n\nThis made those who had accrued such offshore loans liable for \"loan charges\", effectively requiring them to retrospectively pay back the income tax they had avoided.\n\nBBC News has spoken to contractors who subscribed to the AML scheme in 2011 and were left with huge tax bills.\n\nOne of them is Doug Adams, who is facing a £90,000 loan charge from HMRC and says the financial fallout and stress has had a disastrous impact on his mental and physical health. He links it to the breakdown of his marriage and a divorce settlement that is forcing him to sell his home.\n\n\"It has effectively destroyed my life. It's meant that, at the age of 56, I'm going to be homeless,\" he said.\n\nMichelle Mone and Doug Barrowman were interviewed by BBC's Laura Kuenssberg last month\n\nAML clients were then sent letters recommending they contact a third company, called Vanquish Options.\n\nVanquish was offering another scheme that would supposedly make the individual's loan charge problem go away, if customers paid a large fee to swap their existing loan for another loan.\n\nThe company was giving people advice that this transaction would square them with the tax authorities.\n\nTax Policy Associates, which conducted an investigation into the practice, has shared a letter with BBC News. It was sent to someone who signed up to the Vanquish scheme in April 2019.\n\nThe letter was intended to be sent to HMRC by the individual to explain why they were no longer liable for a loan charge. In it, the customer would claim they now had \"no outstanding liability\".\n\nTax experts believe this document provides grounds to investigate whether Vanquish Options was engaged in fraud towards HMRC.\n\nIt is unclear what, if any, Barrowman's involvement in the potential fraudulent letters was, but he has defended the lawfulness of the scheme in his response to the BBC.\n\nHowever, Ray McCann, a former president of the Chartered Institute of Taxation and a former HM Inspector of Taxes, told the BBC: \"I think there's undoubtedly enough for HMRC to justify opening a criminal investigation.\"\n\nMr Barrowman has previously denied any involvement in Vanquish.\n\nIn 2019, a spokesman told the Times newspaper he had \"no involvement or interest in Vanquish Options\". In 2020, Mr Barrowman's lawyers told the BBC he had not \"at any time owned or controlled Vanquish\".\n\nHowever, an analysis of the emails sent to people from Vanquish and from Mr Barrowman's AML business shows they share the same IP address - a unique label that identifies a device on the internet or a local network - in the Isle of Man, where his business operations are based.\n\nBBC News has also found AML and Vanquish shared some of the same directors, including a man called Arthur Lancaster.\n\nMr Lancaster, a long-time business partner of Mr Barrowman, has since been appointed director of PPE Medpro, which was awarded contracts worth more than £200m to supply PPE to the NHS.\n\nAs well as the National Crime Agency investigation, the firm is also being sued by the government for breach of contract.\n\nIn a recent BBC interview, Mr Barrowman and his wife Baroness Mone admitted intentionally misleading the press over their connection to PPE Medpro.\n\nAs well as Mr Lancaster, the investigation into Vanquish's directors also found they included Timothy Eve and Paul Ruocco - two close business associates of Mr Barrowman.\n\nLawyers for Mr Barrowman's Knox Group denied \"any and all allegations of dishonesty, misconduct and wrongdoing\".\n\nIn a statement, it said HMRC was \"properly notified\" of the schemes and that there had been \"extensive dialogue and disclosure\" with tax authorities for \"several years\".\n\nDuring this time, it said HMRC had \"never even suggested, let alone alleged, that there has been any form of dishonesty or wrongdoing by the Knox Group\".\n\nKnox Group \"deeply and sincerely\" regretted the distress and anguish arising from the HMRC loan charge, which it blamed on \"retrospective\" and \"retroactive\" legal action from the government.\n\nHowever, Dan Neidle, founder of Tax Policy Associates, told BBC News that it would send a \"deeply corrosive\" message if HMRC did not take action against these companies connected to Mr Barrowman in light of the new evidence.\n\n\"It means that you can ignore tax law. You can make up tax schemes that have no prospect of working. You can sell them to people, extract large amounts of money from people, and then when it all goes wrong, you can just walk away, hide in an offshore", "continuation": " island.\"\n\nAn HMRC spokesperson said: \"We collect the tax due under the law, creating a level playing field for everyone and funding public services.

He also appeared alongside then-Prime Minister Theresa May at a media conference.\n\nKurdish-born SNP councillor Roza Salih said she was \"disgusted\" ", "continuation": "by Mr Yousaf's meeting with Mr Erdogan in December as Turkey had stepped up attacks on Kurdish groups in Syria.\n\nThe UK government also threatened to withdraw support for Scottish ministers during overseas visits since no UK official was present.\n\nThe Turkish government has been accused of human rights abuses against Kurds\n\nBefore being questioned about the invite to the Turkish president, Mr Yousaf told BBC Radio 4's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast that he had concerns about his own party's title.\n\n\"I've never really been comfortable with the fact that we have national in our party's name,\" he said.\n\nThe first minister explained that was not because he thought founding members of the SNP had any \"far-right nationalist inclination\" but because the term can be \"misinterpreted\".\n\nHe told the podcast that the SNP had developed a \"very strong brand\" based on being a \"civic national party\".\n\n\"We're a party that believes it doesn't matter really where you come from - what's important is where are we going together,\" the SNP leader said.\n\n\"And there's no doubt about our politics being very routed in the left and the centre left of political discourse.\"\n\nFormer SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said in 2017 that she would have changed the SNP's name if she could \"turn the clock back\" as she believed the word \"national\" could be \"hugely problematic\".\n\nMr Yousaf succeeded Ms Sturgeon as first minister in March last year.\n\nMs Sturgeon, her husband and former SNP chief executive Peter Murrell and treasurer Colin Beattie have since been arrested as part of the police investigation into SNP finances.\n\nAll were released without charge pending further investigation.\n\nThe arrests were part of Police Scotland's Operation Branchform investigation, which centred on about £600,000 raised by the party for independence campaigning.\n\nMr Yousaf told the podcast the police investigation had been \"one of the most difficult times for the party\" and that it had to work hard to rebuild trust.\n\nFormer first minister Nicola Sturgeon was arrested and released without charge\n\nMr Yousaf also spoke of the weeks that his parents-in-law were under siege in Gaza after the conflict broke out in October. They became trapped during a trip to visit relatives before eventually leaving through the Rafah crossing.\n\nHe said for him and his wife Nadia El-Nakla it had been \"probably the lowest points\" of their lives.\n\nPressed on whether he would accuse Israel of \"genocide\", Mr Yousaf said any potential breach of international law should be investigated by the International Court of Justice.\n\nMr Yousaf told the podcast the benefits of being first minister included being able to \"make somebody's day\" but that \"press intrusion\" was one of the major drawbacks.\n\n\"There's no getting away from it and your family, your children, being in the public,\" he said.\n\nHumza Yousaf's apparent attempt to distance himself from the concept of nationalism seems at odds with his own words as recently as last year when he was running for the leadership of the Scottish National Party.\n\nAddressing SNP members at the first hustings of the contest in Cumbernauld, in March 2023, Mr Yousaf appeared to describe himself as a \"nationalist\" in response to a question about a dispute with the UK government over proposed changes to gender law.\n\n\"The starting principle I would say, for any nationalist, the starting principle must be to defend Scotland's parliament and defend Scotland's democracy,\" he said, adding: \"From me, I'm unapologetic, unequivocal. We must stand up to Westminster's power grab.\"\n\nIn 2017, Mr Yousaf's predecessor as SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon also expressed concern about the party's name and its association with nationalism.\n\nYet she too had previously embraced the term \"nationalists,\" to describe herself and her supporters, for example using it five times during her speech to the party's 2014 spring conference in Aberdeen, including in this phrase:\n\n\"Well, my fellow nationalists, after 80 years of campaigning, the last mile of our journey to independence is upon us.\"\n\nThat was a reference to the history of the Scottish National Party which was founded in 1934 by the merger of the National Party of Scotland under the socialist RB Cunninghame Graham and the Scottish Party of the more right-wing Duke of Montrose.\n\nIn more recent times, defenders of the concept of Scottish nationalism have often argued that it could not be further from the \"blood and soil\" version associated with the Nazis and is actually a \"civic nationalism\" built on values rather than identity.\n\nMr Yousaf used a slightly different phrase in this interview, describing the SNP as a \"civic national party\".\n\nThere is an irony that within hours of making those comments, the First Minister was suggesting that an authoritarian leader, known for his slogan \"One Nation, One Flag, One Motherland, One State\", should visit Scotland.\n\nThe SNP's opponents sometimes scoff at 'civic nationalism', accusing the party of window-dressing a discredited, if not dangerous, concept.\n\nOf course Scottish nationalism does not stand alone.

Tata Steel employs 8,000 people across the UK.\n\nHowever, the money will see new electric arc furnaces replace existing blast furnaces, reducing the number of workers needed.\n\nThe company, which asked the government to provide further funds, is also investing £700m in the site.\n\nPort Talbot's steelworks is one of the biggest polluters in the UK, with its two existing blast furnaces working around the clock.\n\nThe new £1.25bn greener arc furnaces are expected to be operational within three years of getting regulatory and planning approval.\n\nThe UK government said the deal \"has the potential to safeguard\" more than 5,000 jobs across the UK.\n\nUp to 3,000 people could lose their jobs as a result of the deal\n\nBut the unions have criticised this plan, with GMB's national officer for steel, Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, saying: \"Tata must pull back from the brink, work with us to deliver a better outcome for their workforce and protect UK virgin steelmaking.\n\n\"If this plan remains unchanged, Tata and UK government have fired the starting gun on the death of UK steel.\"\n\nShe warned closing down facilities while supplying mills with foreign steel would \"put us on a collision course with massive industrial unrest\".\n\nThe unions also want Tata to wait for a report from consultant Syndex, which is looking at other options to decarbonise the steel industry.\n\nRoy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Community union, said: \"This is another kick in the teeth for Tata's loyal workforce and the Port Talbot community.\n\n\"The unions do not accept the closure of the heavy end and we continue to believe the blast furnaces are crucial to the transition to green steelmaking.\"\n\nHe added the unions would \"never accept\" the plan and would \"oppose it with everything we've got\".\n\nAlun Davies, also from Community, said staff had been left \"on tenterhooks\".\n\n\"All we want is meaningful consul", "continuation": "tation with the company,\" he said.\n\nAhead of the expected announcement Tata said it hoped to start formal consultation with staff representatives shortly.\n\nBut on Wednesday the firm said: \"Despite today's press commentary, we are not in a position to make a formal announcement about any proposals for a transition to a decarbonised future for Tata Steel UK.\n\n\"We hope to soon start a formal information and consultation process with our employee representatives, in which we would share more details about any such proposals.\n\n\"We believe our £1.25bn proposal to transition to green steel making will secure the business for the longer term, bolster UK steel security and help develop a green ecosystem in the region.\n\n\"We are committed to a meaningful information and consultation process with our trade union partners and will carefully consider any proposals put forward.\""}

What to do? I tell this truth to our American friends, and I also stopped the attempt to impose a reality on us that would harm Israel's security,\" he said.\n\nMr Netanyahu has spent much of his political career opposing Palestinian statehood, boasting just last month that he was proud to have prevented its establishment, so his latest remarks come as no surprise.\n\nBut the very public rebuttal of Washington's diplomatic push, and determination to stay the current military course, show the chasm widening with Israel's western allies.\n\nSince the 7 October attacks - the worst in Israel's history, when Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 Israelis and took some 240 hostage - the US has supported its right to defend itself.\n\nBut as the death toll in Gaza has grown, and the scenes of horror there have abounded, Western governments have called for Israeli restraint.\n\nThe White House has repeatedly tried to influence Israel's military policy: urging more precision-guided weapons rather than the blanket air strikes; discouraging a ground offensive; and calling for a two-state solution, with a role for the Palestinian Authority in post-conflict Gaza.\n\nProtesters in Tel Aviv have been calling for the safe release of Israeli hostages\n\nMr Kirby said the US has been \"exceedingly clear\" about what it wants Gaza to look like after the war.\n\n\"We want governance in Gaza that's representative of the aspirations of the Palestinian people, that they have a vote and a voice in what that looks like and that there's no reoccupation of Gaza,\" he said.\n\nWashington's advice has frequently fallen on deaf ears or been met by outright rejection - often publicly so, during visits by the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nThat, in turn, has hardened frustration in some American circles over the Biden administration's apparent blanket support for Israel, with strident calls to put conditions on US aid to its Middle East ally.\n\nIsrael's prime minister's comments will please his dwindling support base and the far-right ministers who prop up his government.\n\nBut they will dismay those at home and abroad who are increasingly horrified by the human cost of this war. Recent polls show most Israelis want him to prioritise bringing the remaining hostages home over the potentially impossible aim of destroying Hamas.\n\nCorrection 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200.

It said there was some damage but no injuries, and the vessel remained seaworthy.\n\nUS National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the re-designation of the Houthis as \"global terrorists\" is in response to the Iran-backed group's attacks on commercial shipping in the region.\n\nThe move to re-designate the Houthis reverses Secretary of State Antony Blinken's 2021 decision to remove the rebels from the US Special", "continuation": "ly Designated Global Terrorist List (SDGT).\n\nIn a statement, Mr Sullivan said the recent Houthi attacks \"fit the textbook definition of terrorism\", as they have put US personnel in danger and jeopardized global trade operations.\n\n\"If the Houthis cease their attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, the United States will immediately re-evaluate this designation,\" Mr Sullivan added.\n\nIn the waning days of the Trump administration officials imposed the SDGT and foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) labels on the Houthis.\n\nThis action was taken despite warnings from the UN and aid groups that it could push war-torn Yemen into a large-scale famine.\n\nBut in 2021, shortly after President Joe Biden's inauguration, that decision was reversed by Mr Blinken, the newly installed Secretary of State. He cited the dire humanitarian situation faced by the people of Yemen.\n\nSpeaking to reporters ahead of Wednesday's announcement, senior administration officials defended the decision to reinstate the SDGT designation but not the FTO designation, which they said had been taken to ensure the continued flow of aid into Yemen.\n\n\"It was the correct step to revoke,\" one official said, arguing that it was a move taken in \"recognition of a very dire humanitarian situation\" in the country and to ensure that \"US policies weren't impeding\" civilians' access to urgent aid.\n\nBut they accepted that the Houthis' campaign of attacks on commercial shipping, which has now seen dozens of missiles fired at vessels in the Red Sea, has become \"unacceptable\".\n\nThe new SDGT designation will also bar people and companies in the US from offering any support to the Houthis.\n\nHowever, officials were keen to emphasise that a range of exemptions will be worked into the new designation to ensure humanitarian aid continues to flow into Yemen, a country devastated by almost a decade of civil war.\n\n\"We are rolling out unprecedented carve outs and licenses to help prevent adverse impacts on the Yemeni people,\" said Mr Sullivan in his statement. \"The people of Yemen should not pay the price for the actions of the Houthis.\"\n\nThe Houthis began attacking merchant vessels in November, saying they were responding to Israel's military operation in Gaza. Since then, the group has launched dozens of attacks on commercial tankers passing through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.\n\nIn response, the US and UK launched a wave of air strikes against dozens of Houthi targets on 11 January. The strikes - supported by Australia, Bahrain, the Netherlands and Canada - began after Houthi forces ignored an ultimatum to cease their attacks in the region.\n\nBiden administration officials denied that the new terrorist designation was an acceptance that the air campaign may not deter further Houthi attacks.\n\n\"We see these sanctions as one piece of a broader effort to bring the Houthis back from the terror attacks they are currently committing,\" one official said. \"Our sanctions are best not seen in isolation but as part of a broader effort.\"\n\nIn the wake of last week's strikes, the Houthis said the US and UK would \"soon realise\" the action was \"the greatest folly in their history\".\n\n\"America and Britain made a mistake in launching the war on Yemen because they did not benefit from their previous experiences,\" senior Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti wrote on social media.\n\nYemen has been devastated by a civil war that escalated in 2015, when the Houthis seized control of large parts of the west of the country from the internationally recognised government and a Saudi-led coalition intervened in an effort to restore its rule.\n\nThe fighting has reportedly left more than 160,000 people dead and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, with two thirds of the population - 21 million people - in need of some form of aid."}

At the pre-inquest hearing the family were told the court was short-staffed and had a backlog of 500 cases, which had built up over the pandemic.\n\nThey say they only discovered what drug their son had taken before he died, on 18 December 2020, after investigating his death with one of his friends - including examining photographs that showed the scene of Will's death.\n\nThey say a vital piece of evidence - the packet of blue pills found next to Will's body - was not tested until they raised it with the coroner's court a year after his death.\n\nTheir son's blood sample was destroyed after the company storing it went into administration, and by the time it came to the inquest, the family say they felt traumatised by the whole process.\n\n\"We thought the inquest system was there to give us answers,\" Mrs Melbourne says. \"Instead, we felt blocked at every turn. It was outrageous that we had to take the investigation on ourselves.\"\n\nThe parents of an autistic teenager follow his trail of evidence to uncover how he died.\n\nDescribed by those who knew him as a \"genius\", Will had been hoping to study mathematics at Cambridge. He was funny, passionate, and loved his friends and family, his parents say.\n\nHe was also autistic and battled with crippling social anxiety. Diagnosed at the age of eight, his parents say he received little support from any services.\n\nDiagnosed with autism at the age of eight, Will's family say he received little support\n\nThey say the world could be extremely challenging for Will, and by the time he was in his mid-teens, his anxiety had morphed into severe depression.\n\n\"He just wanted an escape from the pain,\" his mother explains. \"He was self-medicating with drugs.\"\n\nAccording to the Autism Research Centre, at the University of Cambridge, autistic people across the UK are far more likely to use recreational drugs to self-medicate for their mental health symptoms due to an absence of specific support in the NHS.\n\n\"This wasn't someone who's just trying to get high to have a good time,\" Mrs Melbourne says. \"It was an obsession with trying to make himself feel better.\"\n\nWill documented his struggles on YouTube in the months before his died\n\nIn just a few months, Will had been in and out of A&E nine times following suicide attempts and the police had been called more than 50 times.\n\nThe local authority, Cheshire East Council, had told the family their only option was to make their son homeless - and then they would find Will supported accommodation to help with his mental health issues.\n\nAt the time of his death, Will had been living in assisted accommodation for six months.\n\n\"It was like throwing out our sick child, but we felt we had no choice,\" his mother says. \"We couldn't get the support he needed and every day something more dangerous would happen. We also had to protect our daughter, Alice.\"\n\nWill's behaviour became so volatile he could no longer live with his family\n\nBy now, Will was ordering drugs from the dark web.\n\nOn 18 December 2020, he received what he believed to be oxycodone - a highly addictive opioid which not only helps with pain relief, but can also reduce the symptoms of anxiety.\n\n\"He could get so anxious he would be scared to leave the building. He wasn't getting any mental health support and he was struggling to cope,\" Mrs Melbourne says. \"His flat was in a complete state. We couldn't help because we weren't allowed in because of Covid regulations.\"\n\nWill's flat was in disarray when his body was found surrounded by debris\n\nThe inquest heard that because Will was deemed to have capacity, Richmond Fellowship, the charity that ran his assisted accommodation, was unable to prevent him ordering drugs or help keep his flat in order.\n\nOn the day he died, Will had been planning to meet friends. His parents now know that the two blue pills he took, marked M30, were not oxycodone. They were metonitazene - a synthetic opioid hundreds of times stronger than morphine.\n\n\"The only reason we now know that is because we investigated,\" his father says, \"and Will helped us with that\".\n\nMetonitazene is part of the family of nitazenes, synthetic opioids recently linked to dozens of deaths across the UK.\n\nWill had kept a careful log of everything he took, how he consumed it, and at what time he had taken it. It was this log that helped his parents understand what he thought he had ordered and how much he had taken.\n\nWith the help of Will's best friend, Matt Beton, they were able to guess Will's password and access his computer where they found these detailed tables and lists. 'We had to investigate our autistic son's death'\n\n\"He left his own breadcrumb trail,\" Matt explains. \"I couldn't have pieced it all together - his parents couldn't have pieced it all together.\n\n\"But with collaboration between us, we were able to figure out exactly what happened.\"\n\nWill and Matt were best friends for many years\n\nThe inquest heard that the investigating team from Cheshire Police had spotted the drugs, \"Googled\" them, and decided they were oxycodone. Yet despite toxicology tests from Will's blood coming back negative for oxycodone, the blue pills were not tested.\n\nCheshire Police said it is not \"common practice\" to test all drugs found at the scene of sudden deaths.\n\nThey added that because Will's death was not suspicious, a standard post-mortem and toxicology report was requested by the coroner and no further tests were requested.\n\nCoroner Victoria Davies agreed with the evidence gathered by Will's family, that the blue pills were metonitazene and that Will had bought them believing them to be oxycodone.\n\nWill kept a detailed log of the drugs he had taken on his computer\n\nThe court heard the drug would have been so potent it would have caused respiratory depression - preventing Will's lungs from taking in enough oxygen - and he would have died within an hour.\n\nThe inquest verdict was death by misadventure.\n\nCheshire East Council said it supported the coroner's findings and it remains \"committed to providing the highest standards of care\" and will continue to \"identify opportunities to improve services\".\n\nRichmond Fellowship, which ran the assisted accommodation in Macclesfield, said the \"health, safety and wellbeing of the people we support have always been at the heart of everything we do\" and that it would continue to review and improve its services.\n\n\"Our son is now part of a wider picture about synthetic opioids,\" Will's mother says. \"Maybe if they had tested the drugs as a matter of course, the warning bells about this drug could have been sounded sooner.\"\n\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by mental health issues, please visit BBC Action Line to find information on organisations that can help.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."}

People are fed up with being told what to eat, what to drink, how to travel. There's a way of life that also deserves respect,\" he said.\n\n\"I'd be very suspicious if I heard the government was telling people how to live their lives for a month,\" said former health minister Aurélien Rousseau when asked in early December, before his resignation, about whether he was joining Dry January.\n\nFor critics these reactions are all signs that the government, taking its cue from President Macron, has decided it is more important not to offend the wine lobby than to promote good health.\n\n\"We know full well that with this government, and above all with this president, the links with the alcohol lobby are particularly strong,\" said addictologist Jean-Pierre Couteron.\n\nSupporters of Dry January say France is still Europe's fourth largest consumer of alcohol, and that alcohol is responsible for more than 40,000 French deaths every year.\n\nPresident Macron was accused of encouraging binge drinking when he downed a bottle after a rugby final\n\nAnd they say that a campaign that enjoyed government financial and moral backing would reach far more people than the 16,000 who signed up in 2023.\n\nThe allegation that the president personally discouraged support for Dry January is backed by his very public endorsement of alcohol in the past.\n\nIn 2", "continuation": "022 he was elected Personality of the Year by the Review of French Wines magazine after he said he drank wine twice every day, at lunch and at dinner.\n\nLast June he was filmed downing a bottle of Corona beer in one, in the changing room of the Stade Toulousain rugby team at the Stade de France - inviting accusations that he was encouraging binge drinking.\n\nWith the wine industry bringing in €9bn (£7.7bn; $10bn) in foreign sales every year, the decision to champion French winemakers is certainly rational.

His wife thought the baby was so beautiful, they decided to adopt him.\"\n\n\"I listened to his version, but I didn't believe it,\" the now-47-year-old Aníbal says.\n\nAníbal agreed to take a DNA test, which confirmed he was Sara's son. He and Sara have spent the last 20 years building a relationship.\n\n\"At the beginning it was very difficult. Imagine, a person that didn't raise you, that you've only just met, but you know she is your biological mother, this was something we had to overcome,\" he explains.\n\nSara Méndez was able to find her son and is now a grandmother to his baby\n\nAníbal has also had to grapple with his conflicting feelings for the couple who raised him: \"I am very clear that these two people who brought me up committed this terrible crime of taking a baby and changing its identity. But I grew up with their love and I am not going to erase this love they gave me or the love I also felt for them.\"\n\nSara says that reconnecting with her son \"took many years of work\".\n\nOf the estimated 500 babies taken in Argentina from women political detainees like Sara during the dictatorship, 133 children have been reunited with their birth families.\n\nBut the baby thefts have left a legacy of complex trauma.\n\n'I think that the stealing of babies was one of the cruellest things these dictatorships did - the taking of a child by people who formed part of a repressive apparatus that persecuted, tortured and killed their parents,\" Sara says.\n\nShe is concerned that the proposed law currently winding its way through Congress \"doesn't distinguish between common crimes and crimes committed by the state\".\n\nShe also thinks the bill \"does not consider the victim's opinion when it comes to deciding any modification of the prison regime for convicted officers\".\n\nThree retired military officers and one policeman are currently serving sentences in Uruguay in connection with the kidnap and torture of Sara Méndez.\n\nOne of them has already been released into house arrest.

There is also no record in pilot logs of Mr Clinton going there.\n\nMr Clinton himself has said he flew on Epstein's plane four times, including twice to Africa, because they worked together on humanitarian projects.\n\nBut those meetings took place before the financier came under investigation, he said, and he had no knowledge of his crimes.\n\nThe document also includes testimony about Donald Trump from Ms Sjoberg about a diversion Epstein's plane made to New Jersey to visit the businessman in 2001 at one of his casinos.\n\nWhen pilots said their plane could not land in New York and would need to stop in Atlantic City, Epstein said he would call up Trump and drop by to see him, she said.\n\nThe documents contain no alleged wrongdoing by Mr Trump.\n\nMs Sjoberg is asked whether she ever gave Mr Trump a massage and she said she did not.\n\nMs Sjoberg said she had met the singer through Epstein, although she did not allege any wrongdoing by him."}

Keir Starmer says Labour would offer a \"decade of national renewal\" in government\n\nSir Keir Starmer has insisted there are real dividing lines between Labour and the Conservatives ahead of the looming general election.\n\nThe Labour leader dismissed criticism his policies are not different enough to PM Rishi Sunak's.\n\nHe told the BBC his plans to decarbonise electricity by 2030 and build more homes were among \"huge\" areas of disagreement.\n\nAnd he said the election would enable voters to \"test this in practice\".\n\nSir Keir was speaking after a new year speech in which he vowed to defeat the Tories with \"project hope\" and fight the election on the economy.\n\nRishi Sunak has said his \"working assumption\" was that the next election - which must take place by January 2025 - would take place in the second half of this year.\n\nThe prime minster's comments will be seen as an attempt to dampen speculation in recent weeks he might call a general election on 2 May, when local elections are being held.\n\nBut it will also shape the political year ahead, as the parties seek to differentiate themselves in the minds of voters as polling day approaches.\n\nThe Labour leader has recently faced criticism his blueprint for power is not specific enough - with Labour MP Jon Cruddas, the party's former policy chief, saying he was \"elusive\".\n\nIn an interview with BBC political editor Chris Mason, Sir Keir rejected this, adding he did not think there was \"anything elusive\" about his party's plans to halve violence against women and girls.\n\nSpeaking to about his commitment to net zero energy by 2030, he added: \"the [Conservative] government isn't going anywhere near that\".\n\nHe added: \"I can't see that there's any ambiguity there, or lack of clarity there.\n\n\"And for anybody who thinks there is, then I say just bring the election on. Let's test this in practice.\"\n\nHe also dismissed recent reports he was set to further water down his party's plan to eventually spend £28bn on green energy projects, adding he was \"absolutely committed to that mission\".\n\nThe Labour leader has announced he would \"bulldoze\" restrictive planning rules and overrule objecting local MPs to boost housebuilding in England.\n\nLabour has set a target to build 1.5m homes in England in five years if elected. The government's own ambition is broadly similar, pledging 300,000 new units a year from the mid-2020s.\n\nIn an interview with Sky News, Sir Keir said he wanted to make a \"positive case\" to voters and predicted the Tories would \"go low\" with personal attacks during the campaign.\n\nSuggesting his party would not hesitate to respond in kind, he added: \"if they want to go with fire into this election, we will meet their fire with fire\".\n\nIn his new year speech in Bristol, Sir Keir said Labour was offering \"national renewal\" as an alternative to the \"miserabilist Tory project\", vowing to \"crush their politics of divide and decline with a new project hope\".\n\nBut he added: \"Not a grandiose utopian hope. Not the hope of the easy answer, the quick fix, or the miracle cure. People have had their fill of that from politicians over the past 14 years.\n\n\"No - they need credible hope, a frank hope, a hope that levels with you about the hard road ahead, but which shows you a way through, a light at the end of the tunnel. The hope of a certain destination.\"\n\nQuizzed afterwards by reporters, Sir Keir said that \"in principle\" he wanted to see lower taxes on working people but that \"before we get to the question of tax we've got to grow the economy\".\n\nHe also said he was \"fundamentally opposed\" to the idea of scrapping or reducing inheritance tax - something some Conservative MPs have called for.\n\nAsked if Labour would overturn any cut to inheritance tax if the party wins power, Sir Keir said: \"I don't believe in tax breaks for those who are already well-off when there's nothing on offer for working people.\"\n\nIn his speech Sir Keir pledged to \"clean up politics\" with a \"crackdown on cronyism\", saying the public were \"right to be anti-Westminster\" and \"angry about what politics has become\".\n\n\"After the sex scandals, the expenses scandals, the waste scandals, the contracts for friends, even in a crisis like the pandemic, some people have looked at us and concluded we're all just in it for ourselves,\" he said.\n\nHe also criticised Liz T", "continuation": "russ - who served as prime minister for just 49 days - for nominating her allies for honours after \"crashing the economy\".\n\nSir Keir said a Labour government would \"restore standards in public life\" and show \"zero tolerance towards the darker side of Westminster\"."}

Only eight players contest the 16-week series and the 16-year-old, who was beaten 7-4 by Luke Humphries in Wednesday's final, has been included. World number one Humphries is also involved and will make his debut in the competition.

{"context": "In the blizzard of guesswork about politics in the coming year, there's a fact as solid as a lump of coal at the bottom of your Christmas stocking.\n\nThe election campaign has to begin in 2024, and it looks likely it will end, with the election itself, in 2024 too.\n\nIndeed, the prime minister told reporters just before Christmas: \"2024 will be an election year.\"\n\nFirst, let's examine the facts about why the campaign legally has to begin in 2024.\n\nTuesday 17 December 2024 marks five years since Parliament met after the last general election, and so if Rishi Sunak hasn't trundled to the palace to see the King to request a dissolution of Parliament before then, Parliament will dissolve automatically and a general election campaign would formally begin just before Christmas.\n\nTuesday 28 January 2025 is the latest the next election can legally be. (You can read more on all this here, courtesy of the Institute for Government).\n\nSo there was a snippet of hard facts.\n\nOnce we are into the new year, the sprocket wheel of general election fever will crank around a few notches. For some at least.\n\nMost people miss most of what's going on at Westminster most of the time, but there's a mild risk nonetheless of getting a little tired of the E word.\n\nI have been trying to ration how many times I used the E word in 2023, conscious that folk might say: \"Oh shut up about it until you can tell us when ", "continuation": "it's actually happening.\"\n\nThe thing is, once we are into January all the parties will think, behave and prepare as though the election will be in the spring, until it legally can't be.\n\nDitto the summer, ditto the autumn, and yes, ditto the winter.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer with new Tamworth MP Sarah Edwards after her by-election victory\n\nAs I've written before, there is an excitable industry of guesswork about the timing of the election at Westminster.\n\nThe timing will obsess Westminster to the point of tedium, with just a handful of folk around the prime minister in the know and/or influential in arriving at an answer.\n\nIt means the opposition parties, not least Labour, will have to work towards potential election dates that may turn out to be phantom - and do so several times until polling day is actually announced.\n\nThat has practical campaigning consequences: if you are Keir Starmer - or any of the other opposition leaders - what do you announce in, say, March, when the election might be two months away, or seven months away? Or more, or less?\n\nFor Labour, in particular, we are still in the foothills of scrutiny; this will notch up and up and up with every passing week next year.\n\nFor the Conservatives, the scrutiny has been incessant and Rishi Sunak has attempted multiple reboots to try to improve his political fortunes.\n\nSo far at least, they haven't seemed to work.\n\nLet's put the coming general election into a bit of historical context.\n\nIn the past century, no party has won five general elections in a row.\n\nGranted David Cameron needed a little help from the Liberal Democrats to get over the line in 2010, but the last four general elections have led to a Conservative prime minister.\n\nRishi Sunak is attempting to win a fifth on the spin.\n\nPerhaps little wonder diminishing returns might be kicking in with those reboots.\n\nThe electorate tends to tire of parties that have been in government for a fair chunk of time.\n\nHistory suggests it will be mighty difficult for the Conservatives to win again.\n\nBut then again, the Conservatives are incredibly good at winning general elections, including ones many suspect they will lose.\n\nAnd Labour are very good at losing general elections, including ones many suspect they will win.\n\nIn 18 out of the 28 general elections since 1918 the Conservative Party have won the most seats.\n\nLabour have won the most seats on the other 10 occasions.\n\nAnd Labour approach the next election from a starting point that is the worst for them in nearly a century.\n\nIn 2019 they won 202 seats, their lowest number since 1935.\n\nWith Jeremy Corbyn as leader they secured 10.3 million votes, 32.1% of the total - a share lower than in 2017, but higher than in 2015 and 2010.\n\nBut it is seats that count and they need to count one heck of a lot more.\n\nSo, when it comes to the history books, something will have to give.\n\nThe Conservatives are seeking to make history.\n\nLabour is seeking to win from a generationally bad starting point, from their perspective.\n\nNext into the mix, the Scottish National Party, which was the colossus of Scottish politics at the last three general elections in a row.\n\nAnd in government at Holyrood since 2007.\n\nBut the evidence - such as Labour's victory in the Rutherglen and Hamilton West by-election - suggests they're on the slide and Keir Starmer is super keen to capitalise.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are chipper and are hopeful they can chip away at Conservative support, and seats, primarily in the south of England.\n\nReform UK, honorary president one Nigel Farage, continue to spook the Tories too with their polling numbers.\n\nThe Green Party lose their only MP Caroline Lucas, who is standing down - but hope to be competitive in a handful of places.\n\nThen there is Plaid Cymru in Wales, and the platter of parties that contest Northern Ireland's seats.\n\nAnd talking of Northern Ireland, could devolved government return to Stormont early in the new year, with - for the first time - a Sinn Féin first minister? Let's see.\n\nSo here goes with politics in 2024.\n\nI'll try to guide you through it.\n\nAnd sorry in advance for the E word. It'll feature quite a bit."}

The Liberal Democrats have called on Mr Sunak to hold the vote in May.\n\nSNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said Mr Sunak had \"shown a little bit of cowardice\" by \"trying to run back into the autumn\".\n\nGreen Party co-leader Carla Denyer said voters did not want the Conservatives to \"get one day more to screw up the country\", but were not \"feeling inspired by the Labour party either\".\n\nOpposition parties were talking up the prospect of a May poll so that, if the prime minister decided to wait until later in the year, they could then accuse him of running scared.\n\nMr Sunak and his team have clearly decided this is not a risk they want to take - and the phrase \"working assumption\" gives him enough room to change his mind should circumstances change.\n\nThe prime minister told broadcasters on a visit to a youth centre in Mansfield: \"I've got lots that I want to get on with.\"\n\nHe declined to rule out a May election categorically, but repeated his intention to go to the country later in the year.\n\n\"I want to keep going, managing the economy well and cutting people's taxes.\n\n\"But I also want to keep tackling illegal migration. I'm determined to keep delivering for the British people,\" the prime minister said.\n\nHe acknowledged that the last 12 months had been \"tricky\", but promised a \"better year\" ahead.\n\n\"Look, 2023, I'll be honest, it wasn't the easiest of years, for any of us, it wasn't an easy year for our country.\"\n\nThe nation was still dealing with the legacy of Covid, the war in Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza, he said.\n\nMr Sunak raised the prospect of further tax cuts after the easing of national insurance on 6 January, despite the Conservatives increasing the overall tax burden to its highest level since the Second World War.\n\nHe said: \"We want to do more because as we manage the economy responsibly, we can cut your taxes, give you and your family peace of mind, immediate relief from some of the challenges you're facing and confidence that the future is going to be better for you and your children.\"\n\nEarlier, in a speech in Bristol, Sir Keir set out what he called \"Project Hope\" for a \"downtrodden Britain\".\n\nHe said the public were right to be \"anti-Westminster\" after 14 years of Conservative rule, but added his party was offering \"a decade of national renewal\".\n\nIn a dividing line with the Conservatives, he signalled he would wait to grow the economy before cutting taxes."}

Watch: How the Japan passenger plane burst into flames\n\nJapanese authorities said late on Wednesday that the coastguard plane was not cleared for take-off on Haneda's runway. The plane was scheduled to deliver relief supplies to earthquake-hit areas.\n\nAccording to officials, the JAL flight was cleared to land on runway 34R at Haneda while the coastguard aircraft was told to \"taxi to holding point C5\" - a place on the airfield's taxiway system where aircraft await permission to enter the active runway for take-off.\n\nThe transcript shows the coastguard aircraft acknowledged the call from air traffic to taxi to the holding point - its last transmission before the collision.\n\nThe transcripts appear to contradict the coastguard plane's captain - the only one of the six crew to survive - who told investigators he had been given permission to enter the runway which the JAL airliner was approaching.\n\nThe BBC has also found information that suggests the series of lights at the relevant holding point may not have been working. But experts point out there are other visual cues like painted markings which would show where aircraft needed to stop short of the runway.\n\nThe well-drilled scenes on the Japan Airlines plane contrast starkly with aircraft evacuations that fail to strictly adhere to safety protocols.\n\nIn 2016, an Emirates Boeing 777 crash landed in Dubai and video footage showed chaotic scenes of passengers trying to take their luggage with them as they fled to the emergency slides. The crew were praised for their efforts to evacuate passengers, and luckily all 300 on board the Dubai flight survived.\n\nTuesday's incident is the first major accident involving an Airbus A350, one of a new breed of aircraft built largely of advanced materials such as carbon fibre-reinforced plastic.\n\nThe aircraft manufacturer is sending a team of specialists to assist in the investigation of the Japan Transport Safety Board."}

That number is expected to rise, as some areas surrounding the town are still cut off by ruptured roads and landslides, with help unable to reach people.\n\nShigeru Sakaguchi, mayor of Wajima, said food and other aid supplies had reached only 2,000 out of 10,000 evacuees from the town so far.\n\nAccording to the mayor of Suzu, a town with a population of about 13,000, almost none of its houses are standing. Around 90% are completely or almost completely collapsed, Masuhiro Izumiya said.\n\nA small tsunami struck the town one minute after the major quake.\n\nJapan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, and activity has been increasing around Noto since the end of 2020.

{"context": "Thousands poured onto the streets of Beirut for the funeral of Saleh al-Arouri\n\nThousands of people have attended the funeral in Beirut of Saleh al-Arouri, the top Hamas leader assassinated in a suspected Israeli attack in the Lebanese capital two days ago.\n\nCrowds carried banners with his picture and waved Palestinian and Hamas flags through the streets amid the sound of music, prayers and heavy gunfire, while Hamas officials vowed to retaliate.\n\nThe assassination of Arouri was a blow for Hamas - he was a deputy Hamas leader and a key figure in the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the group's armed wing - and renewed fears of a wider war in the region. It also hit its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed movement, as it struck Dahiyeh, a suburb of the city that is a stronghold for the group.\n\nIn Lebanon, again, the focus is on what Hassan Nasrallah, the influential Hezbollah leader, will decide to do.\n\nLess than 24 hours after the attack, he addressed his followers, in a speech that had been scheduled to commemorate the Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani, killed in a US drone strike four years ago. He could not ignore what had just happened in his own backyard.\n\nAs usual, Nasrallah spoke from an undisclosed location, and described Arouri's assassination as a \"flagrant Israeli aggression\" that would not go unpunished. \"If the enemy considers waging a war against Lebanon, our battle will be without boundaries or rules,\" he said.\n\nBut, crucially, there was no open threat to a", "continuation": "ttack Israel, which has neither confirmed or denied involvement in the killing, nor any indication of how Hezbollah might act.\n\nOne of Hezbollah's aims is the destruction of Israel, which sees the group as a more formidable enemy than Hamas. Hezbollah has a vast arsenal of weapons including precision-guided missiles that can strike deep into Israeli territory, as well as tens of thousands of well-trained, battle-hardened fighters.\n\nSince the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October, Hezbollah has been attacking positions in northern Israel almost every day, describing the actions as its support for the Palestinian group. The Israeli military has retaliated, but so far, the violence has been largely contained to areas along the Lebanon-Israel border.\n\nAl-Arouri's assassination was a blow for Hamas, but it also hit its ally Hezbollah\n\nHezbollah has calculated its actions to prevent a full-scale war with Israel, and there is no indication this strategy is likely to change. Many here still remember the destruction caused by the month-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, and with Lebanon suffering a massive economic crisis, there is virtually no public support for any military confrontation.\n\nIsraeli authorities have warned Hezbollah against escalating the conflict. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has in the past said Israel's military could do to Beirut what it had done to Gaza.\n\nOn Thursday, as he met US envoy Amos Hochstein in Tel Aviv, Mr Gallant reaffirmed his country's determination to change the security situation in northern Israel, to allow the return of residents evacuated due to constant attacks. But, he said, there was a \"short window of time for diplomatic understandings, which we prefer\".\n\nSome senior Israeli officials, however, have supported further action against Hezbollah to eliminate the threat posed by the group.\n\nNasrallah is expected to address his supporters again on Friday. His latest speech may be an indication that for whatever reason, he wants to avoid triggering a bigger conflict with Israel. However, he needs to be seen to be giving a response to the attack in Beirut. But any reaction is likely to be calibrated to avoid strong retaliation from Israel, and the possibility of another catastrophic conflict for Lebanon."}

The terms of individual deals are kept confidential though it is thought the biggest names may be able to negotiate special rates.\n\nMrBeast, real name Jimmy Donaldson, said he would publicly reveal the money he made from the X video, which picked up 33 million views in just 10 hours, in a week's time.\n\nHowever, it has some way to go to beat the total audience it gained on the previous platform, where it has been viewed 211 million times since it was posted in September 2023.\n\nRegardless, it amounts to a significant change of heart for MrBeast, who previously said it was not worth his time to post videos to X, as \"even if they got a billion views\" it wouldn't cover the cost.\n\nMrBeast has claimed that his Yo", "continuation": "uTube videos cost millions of dollars to make.

But what I really want to see is the government to accept these amendments.\"\n\nShe said that defeat for the government at that stage could still mean the Rwanda policy gets going before the general election later this year.\n\nMr Anderson said he agreed with \"90% of the bill\" but wanted it \"beefed up\".\n\n\"This is not a rebellion,\" Mr Anderson told GB News. \"We just feel that there's a few areas in the bill that could be tightened up to make sure that it's watertight.\"\n\nAs deputy chairmen, Mr Anderson and Mr Clarke-Smith are expected to support government bills, though they do not hold government roles.\n\nThe proposed amendments are not expected to pass, as both the government and opposition parties are likely to vote them down.\n\nIf the amendments are rejected, rebel backbenchers will have to decide whether or not to support the bill, without the changes they want.\n\nJust 29 Tory MPs voting against the bill on Wednesday could derail the legislation.\n\nHowever, asked if he would vote against it without any changes, Mr Clarke-Smith said: \"Not necessarily… We have to weigh that up at the time.\"\n\nRishi Sunak reiterated his desire to get his Safety of Rwanda Bill passed while on a visit to Leigh-on-Sea, Essex\n\nIn a bid to deter people from trying to get to the UK across the Channel in small boats, the government wants to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. Labour has criticised the policy as an expensive \"gimmick\" and says it would prioritise tackling the smuggling gangs.\n\nThe government's Rwanda policy was blocked by the Supreme Court on the grounds of concerns about the safety of the east African country.\n\nFollowing the court decision, the government introduced the Safety of Rwanda Bill which states that in UK law, Rwanda is a safe country.\n\nIt also allows ministers to ignore emergency orders from the European Court of Human Rights to suspend a flight to Rwanda while an individual legal case was being heard.\n\nThe plans have been criticised from both sides of the Conservative Party, with those on the right fearing it would not prevent legal challenges, while MPs from the party's One Nation group are concerned that any hardening of the bill would risk breaking international law.\n\nRobert Jenrick - who resigned as immigration minister last year - and veteran MP Sir Bill Cash have tabled a number of amendments to the bill aimed at restricting an individual's ability to block their own removal and allowing human rights law to be bypassed.\n\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Jenrick has said that, over the last 30 years, successive governments have shown \"complete disdain\" for voters' concerns about immigration.\n\n\"This is utterly corrosive to trust in democratic politics, and in an election year when the British public has their chance to mark our work, it is a recipe for electoral wipeout,\" he said.\n\nDamian Green, chairman of the One ", "continuation": "Nation group, said: \"We've made our position clear. For all our reservations...we want the government to carry it through unamended.\"\n\nFormer Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said he supported the government's wish to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda but changes were needed.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4 Today programme the bill would benefit from being \"much simpler\" and from removing clauses which seek to limit the jurisdiction of the courts.\n\nOther Conservative MPs, including Sir Simon Clarke, Mark Francois, Sir John Hayes and Danny Kruger - as well as former home secretary Suella Braverman - have suggested they could oppose the entire bill if changes are not made.\n\nSir Simon told BBC Politics Live that if left unamended there was \"every reason\" to believe it would \"fail on contact with reality\".\n\nHe warned that if the bill did not work, the Conservatives would \"get destroyed\" in the general election, expected to take place this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch has not denied a report in The Times that she privately warned the plans did not go far enough.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said the Rwanda plan was \"not compatible\" with international refugee law in a new assessment.\n\nThe UNHCR, the UN's Refugee Agency, has also said the revived plan \"does not meet the required standards relating to the legality and appropriateness of the transfer of asylum seekers and is not compatible with international refugee law\".\n\nIt comes after a YouGov opinion poll indicated the Conservatives were on course for huge losses in the election.\n\nThe polling, reported by the Telegraph, suggests the party could be reduced to just 169 seats."}

He claims the painting is the original, while the one stolen in 2013 was a copy.\n\nThe allegations surfaced in an investigation by the programme 'Report' on the Italian TV broadcaster Rai. The owner of the castle who reported the painting stolen told journalists that the canvas was cut out of the frame in 2013. She also said that a friend of Mr Sgarbi had earlier visited the property and expressed an interest in buying the work.\n\n'Report' also stated it had found that another friend of the politician later transferred a damaged painting of \"The Capture of Saint Peter\" to a restorer. It was said it bore a hole with the same shape as a piece of the canvas cut out of the Piedmont castle frame in 2013.\n\nBy the time the restored work was put on display by Mr Sgarbi in 2021, the painting had the addition of the candle in the top corner.\n\nThe composite image used by Report to illustrate the differences between what it says is the original work, on the left , and the copy, on the right\n\nThe junior minister is now also facing accusations regarding another work: a painting attributed to the French artist Valentin de Boulogne, valued at €5m (£4.3m), which was seized by police in Montecarlo.
