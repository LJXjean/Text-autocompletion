{"context": "The schoolchildren being lured by rebels on TikTok\n\nFighters belonging to breakaway groups associated with Colombia's largest rebel movement are posting videos on TikTok to entice young people to join them. The BBC has investigated the growth of guerrilla \"recruitment\" videos, with dissident factions yet to agree to a peace deal with the Colombian government.\n\n“One or two start the trend and it becomes fashionable in the classroom,” says Lorena (not her real name), a 30-year-old teacher in Cauca, a rural region in south-western Colombia. She says as she enters her class, she is often met by students filming themselves on their smartphones, drawing symbols inspired by the now-demobilised Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrilla group (Farc) on the blackboard, or dancing to revolutionary tunes. Lorena, who asked to remain anonymous for her own security, says this kind of pro-guerrilla behaviour has become increasingly common among pupils. “It used to be more secretive... [but] it has become completely normalised,” she sa", "continuation": "id in an interview with the BBC over Zoom. “Sadly, it’s one or two [students] that start to see the clips [on Tiktok] in one classroom - and then it becomes trendy.” She said students then often disappear, and the next time she sees them they are appearing in TikTok videos - armed and dressed as fighters.\n\nThe BBC found hundreds of guerrilla videos on TikTok (faces blurred by the BBC)\n\nIn Cauca, children and adults alike have grown up alongside the Farc, which has had a strong presence in the region since the leftist armed group was created in 1964. The group, which had over 20,000 members at its height, officially demobilised and signed a peace agreement with the government in 2016. Yet some dissident factions have yet to lay down their weapons, and some of the most powerful of those armed units are currently active in Cauca. These Farc factions have joined forces to form a larger umbrella group, dubbed the Estado Mayor Central (EMC). Authorities estimate the EMC has more than 3,000 members. So far, attempts to negotiate with these diverse factions by the current left-wing government, led by President Gustavo Petro, have faltered. The factions continue to operate, reportedly financing themselves through drug-trafficking and maintaining control of many rural territories. Officials say the dissident groups continue to swell their ranks, with younger people among those being targeted for recruitment. While the recruitment of children by guerrilla groups has been a problem in Colombia for decades, the infiltration of social media has made it more challenging to eliminate, experts and officials told the BBC. The Colombian Ombudsman’s Office Early Alert System Delegate, Ricardo Arias Macías, told the BBC that at least 184 young people were recruited by guerrilla groups in 2023. In 2024, in the first half of the year alone - up to June - 159 young people had enlisted – all of them under 18; 124 of them were children from Cauca. “Those are just the reported cases - most of them don’t even get reported,” he said.\n\nLorena, who has been teaching in poor, remote communities for nine years, says in the past year at least 15 students from her school have left to join the guerrillas. “You feel so much pain, disappointment… so much impotence,” she told the BBC. According to Lorena, the guerrilla factions’ use of social media, particularly TikTok, “exploded” following the Covid pandemic. Now, with the majority of students having phones with internet access, \"we can't control it,\" she says: \"They’re always on them\". Over a period of four weeks, the BBC identified more than 50 accounts on TikTok promoting Colombian guerrillas - featuring fighters showing off their flashy lifestyle and rallying others to join. They do not, however, dwell on the dangers of being part of an armed group. Many of the videos posted by fighters in EMC factions contained implicit recruiting language, encouraging viewers to join one faction or another. Repeatedly, users asked how to join in the comments section. Songs extolling fallen leaders and guerrilla life provide the soundtrack to these videos, and young girls and boys are seen carrying weapons or standing beside coca crops. While some accounts were explicit in stating the name of their faction, many alluded to Farc by using a samurai emoji with a Colombian flag.\n\nSome TikTok users asked how they could join the dissident armed groups\n\nIn April, Colombia’s Defence Minister Iván Velásquez warned of the dangers of such EMC TikTok videos. “These are recruitment actions that are being carried out to attract children - minors - in various regions of the country,” he said. According to Santiago Rodríguez, a journalist who works for Colombian investigative site La Silla Vacia, the EMC has had official social media channels to share statements for a long time, including a WhatsApp group with journalists and a Facebook account. But more recently the content has been migrating to TikTok - and, as such, reaching a younger demographic. According to Sergio Saffon, Colombia expert for investigative media organisation InSight Crime, videos posted by EMC fighters are particularly effective with children living in poor communities. Young people are sold “a great life where you can have anything you may want: money, women, motorcycles,\" says Mr Saffron. Many of the TikTok accounts that the BBC identified were eventually banned by the platform. Yet new content was constantly popping up, as other accounts were taken down. TikTok did not reply to a written request for comment from the BBC, but their community guidelines say that “moderating millions of pieces of content each day is a complex effort, and developing a trusted process to do so is foundational\".\n\nThis TikTok video contains a recruitment message: \"Join us, we await you all for a better future\"\n\nCountering the guerrillas' social media drive is not simple for the Colombian authorities either. The Ombudsman’s Office has created a new delegation specifically to tackle the issue, but it was only just getting off the ground, Mr Arias said. Even the EMC is trying to prevent its members from grandstanding on TikTok, according to Sebastián Martínez, a member of one of the EMC’s factions in Cauca who is officially part of the group’s now-stalled dialogue commission. “There’s no Farc propaganda campaign to recruit people through social media,” he told the BBC, in a Zoom interview. “There are particular cases that sometimes get out of our hands… That can bring security risks, and we are trying to control it,” he said. Mr Martínez conceded that the EMC’s financing came from illegal businesses, such as taxes on coca, poppy, and marijuana growers - though he claimed they were now venturing into legal agricultural crops as well. He also admitted that the group was enlisting children as young as 15 years old, which Colombian authorities view as forced recruitment due to what is described as a \"lack of agency\" at that age. Meanwhile, Lorena is struggling to save her students from the perils of guerrilla life. She and a group of other teachers created a school network to monitor social media accounts, and set up an emergency chat for students to reach out when they feel at risk. “We can’t give them everything. We fight tooth-and-nail, and try to ignore our fears. \"But when you see one life change - when they come back and tell you they’ve graduated college or started a business, that’s what keeps you fighting.”"}
{"context": "Joe Biden’s surprisingly bad debate performance on Thursday night has prompted panic, confusion and even sadness in the Democratic Party, including among people close to the president. There are now serious conversations taking place at the top of the party, in the White House and in the Biden-Harris campaign about a range of options, one of which is whether Joe Biden should step down as a candidate for president. Democratic officials, political operatives, and people close to the president paint a picture of an anxious Democratic Party that is seriously concerned about the strength of their candidate and whether he can beat Donald Trump in November. Among some of the president's allies I’ve spoken to, there’s been hand-wringing about how the preparation for the debate in Atlanta was handled. These people say Mr Biden was over-prepared and overworked by his campaign team - and that if he had been given more time simply to rest in the week leading up to the debate, he would have done much better. Maybe there were too many voices and perspectives and data points put ", "continuation": "in his head, one campaign source suggested to me, and that just threw him off. While that analysis may be correct, the claim that the president was tired and overworked will do little to quell the very real fears that Mr Biden’s advanced age may impact his ability to win this election. These fears over the president’s age, mental fitness and stamina - and the insistence that something must be done about it - are far from new. Back in September, the prominent political columnist David Ignatius, who was a confidant of Mr Biden’s, stated that the president should step aside. In February, Ezra Klein of the New York Times said much the same in a column that generated both buzz and irritation among those inside the White House. Until now, those voices have been one-offs. That changed after last night’s poor debate performance.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Name-calling and insults - key moments from Biden and Trump’s debate\n\nIn the early hours of Friday morning, a string of high-profile Democratic strategists, pundits, and former officials joined the call for Mr. Biden to bow out. I appeared on Morning Joe, an American political morning show that the president frequently watches. Joe Scarborough, the host of the program and a defender of the president, made the point that while Mr Biden can still govern the country, perhaps he no longer has what it takes to win the election. So where does that leave Joe Biden? First, it is important to remember that the decision of whether to continue is - more or less - entirely his. At this point, if he doesn’t want to step back, it’s virtually impossible for him to be removed from the ticket. One campaign source told me any decision to step down would be made by a very small group that includes the president, his wife and his sister, Val Biden. Second, right now the conversation about whether to replace Mr Biden is happening in public among pundits and former officials but it’s still only happening in private among those with actual influence. Indeed this morning, several of the president’s allies (who are also, awkwardly, being floated as his potential replacements) took to television and social media to defend him. California Governor Gavin Newsom said he was “very proud of the president\". Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro told Democrats to “stop worrying\". Senator John Fetterman put it bluntly, saying: “I refuse to join the Democratic vultures on Biden’s shoulder.” My reporting suggests no changes will be made imminently. The team wants to give the president a chance to get out in public and erase the memory of that debate appearance. On Friday, at a markedly more energetic rally in North Carolina, Mr Biden attempted to put concerns over his age and his debate performance to rest. “I know I’m not a young man,” he said. \"I would not be running again if I did not believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job.” On Saturday, he will travel to the ultra-wealthy Hamptons region of New York for fundraisers with Democratic donors. A source on the campaign tells me that, at the moment, the chance of him stepping aside is only around 5%. But if donors were to abandon him en masse, they acknowledge that could change and prompt a speedier decision about his candidacy.\n\nPolling on the public’s reaction to the debate should filter in over the next few days. That too will guide the discussions. Already the campaign is pointing to snap polling data from the debate that shows independent voters had a more unfavourable response to Donald Trump than to Joe Biden. They hope that is replicated in later polls. Joe Biden has been discounted many times before in his political career. When he first ran for Senate he was told he was too young. When he thought of running for president in 2016 he was told it wasn’t his turn. And in 2020 many people felt he didn’t represent the future of a diverse Democratic Party. He has developed a habit of ignoring sceptics. The only people he really trusts are the few close advisers who’ve been with him for years. I’ve been told those advisers, including Ron Klain and Mike Donilon (who prepared him for this disastrous debate), also happen to believe that Joe Biden is the only person who can beat Donald Trump. They were right in 2020. Are they still right today? Yes, Joe Biden has a history of bouncing back, but many Democrats are worried this time is different."}

Comfortably beaten 2-0 by Switzerland at Berlin's Olympiastadion, Luciano Spalletti's side failed to even put up the late fight that at least characterised the comeback draw against Croatia in their final group game. \"I don't think I've witnessed, in my lifetime, a worse Italian team than this,\" said former England striker Gary Lineker on BBC One. In 2006, Italy won their fourth World Cup at this venue, beating France on penalties. Three years ago, the Azzurri went to Wembley and crushed English dreams in another shootout to claim a third European Championship title. There are talented players in this squad but, certainly from the showing against Switzerland, a lack of character - not the craft of Andrea Pirlo, the guile of Marco Materazzi or the grizzly nous of Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini.\n\nOf those who started in the defeat of England in 2021, only goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, defender Giovanni di Lorenzo, midfielder Nicolo Barella and forward Federico Chiesa made Spalletti's starting XI for the limp exit in Berlin. \"From three years ago to this, it's incredible,\" added ex-England captain Alan Shearer. \"I was really shocked at how bad Italy were. They offered nothing in any position, Switzerland toyed with them. \"Up top they were so weak, they offered nothing in front of goal. There was no threat. They were so poor, particularly in forward positions.\"\n\nDefending champions Italy won one of their four games at Euro 2024\n\nSpalletti worked his magic at Napoli last season to win the club's first Scudetto since the Diego Maradona-inspired triumph of 1990. He was supposed to be on a sabbatical, spending time on his farm in Tuscany, but cut it short to take the reins of the national team when Roberto Mancini resigned in August last year. There were Italian fans sporting Maradona jerseys in the stands in Berlin and there was Spalletti on the bench, but there was none of the high-intensity, attacking football that made his Napoli side so enjoyable to watch last season. \"The team were timid in terms of the intensity of the game,\" he said. \"We didn’t do a good job, we weren’t able to maintain a high level of intensity. \"When you are not able to win the ball back, given we don’t possess pace at the back, you have to afford them space.\" Spalletti only had 10 games before the tournament to whip a side that failed to qualify for the World Cup in Qatar into shape, only reaching this tournament as runners-up to England in qualifying. But four games into Euro 2024, and with just a win against Albania and a late draw with Croatia to show for it, Spalletti and Italy's tournament is over. \"They've been shambolic, almost,\" said BBC pundit Rio Ferdinand. \"It's like they've not got one answer or solution for any scenario that's come up in this game today. \"Questions are going to be asked of Spalletti, I'm sure.\" And they were. Immediately after the defeat, the 65-year-old was quizzed about whether he believed he could stay on as national team boss, with the Italian Football Federation quick to back him. \"I have the responsibility for what has happened,\" said Spalletti. \"I picked the players, and of course this is part of a process where I need to get to know players.\"\n\nSpalletti's coaching career began with Empoli in 1993 and has spanned 11 clubs including Roma, Inter and Napoli\n\nSpalletti bemoaned the lack of time he had spent with his squad, compared with other coaches at the tournament, injuries to certain players and even the fact Inter Milan won the title in April. \"Inter won Serie A and then I made sure they are a very professional, serious club because Simone Inzaghi kept training the team in a certain way,\" he explained. \"I was in touch with how often Inter were training, but perhaps you are subconsciously not as applied when you have won the league so early.\" After suggesting he pushed his players too hard in training before the draw against Croatia, this time he said he had let them rest and made six changes to his line-up. \"What happened tonight didn't come down to one single cause,\" he added. \"But if that is the tempo, if you don't do something more in terms of tempo and intensity, it becomes a lot harder to compete, and we were under par.\"\n\nGabriele Gravina, head of Italy's football federation, said Spalletti would stay on. \"I'm pragmatic, it's impossible to resolve problems by abandoning a long-term project or by abandoning the coach and players who have accompanied us in this project,\" said Gravina. \"Spalletti has our faith, he has to have our faith, he needs to get to work, as in 60 days the Nations League begins. \"We can't imagine that a [Kylian] Mbappe or Cristiano Ronaldo will suddenly come on the scene, so we need to be patient.\" Five months into his tenure in Naples, unhappy with the job he was doing, Napoli ultras stole Spalletti's beloved Fiat Panda and said they would only return it if he left the club. After this defeat, one Swiss journalist took the opportunity to quip whether Switzerland were now the Ferrari and Italy a Fiat Panda. \"You have to accept everything,\" said Spalletti", "continuation": ". \"Even rather tasteless allusions like yours – you are clearly a wonderful exponent of sarcasm, and you are right, what more can you say? \"You did a better job than us, you were worthy winners, and we will try and do a better job next time.\" The Napoli ultras eventually gifted Spalletti his steering wheel back when he guided them to a first title in 33 years, and the veteran does not fear question marks over his national team future this time either. \"When you want to scare me, say 'now what, now what'.\" he added. \"I have come under pressure from day one since I decided to become a coach, to make it this far. I am very relaxed in trying to compete at this level.\""}
{"context": "A new nightclub is opening this week with a strict rule that your smartphone camera must be covered with a sticker. Amber's in Manchester is the latest in a handful of venues in the UK to enforce the policy - but in cities like Berlin, renowned for its nightclubs, it's the norm. Amber's director Jeremy Abbott told the BBC the club made the decision because \"we really want the music and the experience to be front and centre\", but the issue is being debated on social media. Some posted on Instagram, external concerns that clubs could suffer as social media videos of their night act as free adverts, while others welcomed the move as \"partying with privacy\".\n\n“It is the fear of being put on the internet isn’t it?\" one woman told the BBC when we asked young people in Manchester how they feel about a no camera phones in clubs rule. “Being really drunk and that embarrassing picture of you ending up on Insta, waking up and seeing the events of last night.” Another woman said: “It does make the vibe better, because the less people [are] on their phone, engaging more with the DJ and stuff, that’s the better environment to have.\"\n\nSo are Britain's clubs at a turning point? Is now the time to get phones off the dancefloor and people's minds back on the music? Sacha Lord, night time economy adviser for Greater Manchester, thinks so. \"These phones are killing the dancefloor, they’re killing the atmosphere,” he says. \"DJs hate it. To look out into a sea of phones and no-one’s dancing is really demoralising.” Smokin Jo, who has been DJing since 1990, remembers when the rave and club scene was burgeoning in the late 80s and early 90s. \"Everyone's got their hands in the air, there's joy, there's happiness. \"Now there's these videos being posted of people standing still with their phone in the air. It's so sad,\" she says. But Dr Lee Hadlington, senior lecturer in cyberpsychology at Nottingham Trent University, says for those clubbers, \"part of their enjoyment is to document their night in terms of photos and memories\".\n\nSmokin Jo wants to see more dancing and fewer smartphones when she's DJing\n\nAt Amber's, phones are not banned outright but clubbers will be required to put a sticker over the camera lens to prevent photos being taken. A content team will be on hand to take and post photos online instead. People violating the rule will be \"politely asked to stop\", says Abbott. \"If you are seen doing it again, you will be asked to leave the venue.\" The rule comes at a tricky time for Britain's nightclub scene, which has struggled to recover from the numerous Covid lockdowns. Between June 2020 and June this year, the number of clubs has fallen from 1,266 to 786, according to figures from the Night Time Industries Association and research firm NeilsenIQ. Abbo", "continuation": "tt concedes Amber's no phones rules is a risk but says the club has been \"blown away\" by the response. Lord says the policy could be a \"shot in the arm\" for the industry and \"bring back the energy to the dancefloor\".\n\nGraeme Park, one of Britain's best-known DJs and a leading figure from Manchester's legendary Hacienda nightclub, says: \"I totally, totally understand and think that no smartphones on the dancefloor is a great idea. \"However, I’ve got a 20-year-old son. He makes music, he DJs, he goes clubbing and he’s like, 'why’s your generation telling our generation we can’t use our smartphones?'\"\n\nDJ Graeme Park wonders how younger clubbers will feel about limiting smartphones\n\nBen Park, Graeme's son, says: “Personally, I’ve got nothing against phones being in clubs. I understand the whole no phone policy but at the same time people want to post pictures of them or their friends on social media, people want to promote it online.\" But he understands why some clubbers - and DJs - get annoyed by so-called TikTok ravers who \"literally go to events just to show that they’ve been there and just post it on TikTok,\" he says. Cyberpsychologist Dr Hadlington says for these clubbers, it could be about a fear of missing out on social media action. \"The paradox is they’re spending more time posting about it than they're enjoying the good time,\" he says.\n\nIt might be a relatively new concept in the UK, but in Berlin, 90% of venues have a no-phones-on-the-dancefloor code, according to Lutz Leichsenring, former spokesperson for Clubcommission Berlin and co-founder of VibeLab. He says that with more tourists coming to the German capital to enjoy the scene, \"I think people really appreciated that this policy was a part of clubbing\". And, on a personal note, he says that for him, \"it is very, very weird when I’m in a club where people around me take pictures and film the whole time\".\n\nAmber's is adopting the same policy that London nightclub fabric has had in place since reopening in 2021 after Covid. The venue has actually been camera-free since it opened its doors in 1999 but as technology changed and smartphones became more ubiquitous it has tweaked its policy. \"When people come in at the point of search, we put a sticker on the camera lens and just really sort of invite people not to use it, that's all it is,\" says fabric's co-founder Cameron Leslie.

Singh, who held the top post for two consecutive terms between 2004 and 2014, was seen as an architect of India's economic liberalisation which changed the country's growth trajectory. The first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru to return to power, Singh was also the first Sikh to assume the top office. Known as a soft-spoken technocrat, he had earlier headed India's central bank, served as a finance secretary and minister, and led the opposition in the upper house of parliament. Here are five milestones from Singh's life that shaped his career and had a lasting impact on more than a billion Indians.\n\nSingh led the initiative to deregulate the economy in the 1990s\n\nSingh was appointed finance minister in 1991 by the Congress party-led government under Prime Minister PV Narsimha Rao. India's economy at the time was facing a serious financial crisis, with the country's foreign reserves at a dangerously low level, barely enough to pay for two weeks of imports. Singh led the initiative to deregulate the economy to avoid its collapse, which he argued was otherwise imminent. Despite stiff opposition from members of his government and party, Singh prevailed. He took bold measures that included devaluing the currency, reducing import tariffs and privatising state-owned companies. He was famously quoted as saying in parliament during his first budget speech in 1991 that \"no power on Earth can stop an idea whose t", "continuation": "ime has come\". Later, as prime minister, Singh continued to build on his economic reform measures, lifting millions of Indians out of poverty and contributing to India's rise as one of the world's fastest-growing major economies.\n\nOpposition parties often criticised Singh for taking directions from the Gandhi family but he always ignored the jibes\n\nThe Congress party made a comeback in 2004 elections, handing a surprise defeat to the government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Congress chief Sonia Gandhi was widely expected to head the government, but many members of the outgoing ruling party raised questions over the fact that she was born in Italy. She declined to take up the post and instead proposed Singh's name, who was seen as a non-controversial, consensus candidate of great personal integrity. In the next parliamentary election, he helped his party win a bigger mandate, but critics often termed him a \"remote-controlled\" prime minister managed by the Gandhi family. Singh often refused to comment on such allegations and kept his focus on the job. He may have started his first stint as prime minister with some reluctance but he soon stamped his authority on the top job. Singh's tenure, particularly between 2004 and 2009, saw the country's GDP grow at a healthy average pace of around 8%, the second fastest among major economies. He took bold decisions on reforms and brought more foreign investment into the country. Experts credit him for shielding India from the 2008 global financial crisis. But his second term, in an alliance with a disparate group of parties, was marked by allegations of corruption against some of his cabinet ministers, though his personal integrity was never questioned. In response to these allegations, he told journalists in 2014 in his last press conference as prime minister that he hoped history would judge him differently. \"I honestly believe that history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media, or for that matter, the opposition parties in parliament,\" he said. \"I think taking into account the circumstances and the compulsions of a coalition polity, I have done as best as I could do under the circumstances.\"\n\nSingh introduced laws that had a far-reaching impact on Indian democracy\n\nAs prime minister, Singh took several far-reaching decisions that continue to impact the health of Indian democracy even today. He introduced new laws that strengthened and guaranteed the right to seek information from the government, allowing citizens an extraordinary power to hold officials accountable. He also introduced a rural employment scheme which guaranteed livelihood for a minimum of 100 days, a measure economists said had a profound impact on rural incomes and poverty reduction. He also brought in a law that guaranteed the right to free and compulsory education for children between the ages of 6 and 14, significantly reducing the school dropout rates. His government also introduced a unique identity project called Aadhar to improve financial inclusion and delivery of welfare benefits to the poor. The current federal government, run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has continued to keep Aadhar as a cornerstone for many of its policies.\n\nIn 1984, prime minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards to avenge a military action she had ordered against separatists hiding in Sikhism's holiest temple in northern India's Amritsar. Her death sparked massive violence that resulted in the death of more than 3,000 Sikhs and a widespread destruction of their property. Singh formally apologised to the nation in 2005 in parliament, saying the violence were \"the negation of the concept of nationhood enshrined in our constitution\". \"I have no hesitation in apologising to the Sikh community. I apologise not only to the Sikh community, but to the whole Indian nation,\" he said. No other prime minister, particularly from the Congress party, had gone this far to apologise in parliament for the riots.\n\nSingh signed a historic deal with the US in 2008 to end India's nuclear isolation\n\nSingh signed a historic deal with the US in 2008 to end India's nuclear isolation after its 1998 testing of the weapon system. His government argued that the deal wouldhelp meet India's growing energy needs and sustain its healthy growth rate. The deal, seen as a watershed moment in the India-US relations, promised to grant a waiver to India to commence civilian nuclear trade with the US and the rest of the world. But it faced massive opposition, with critics of the deal alleging that it would compromise India's sovereignty and independence in foreign policy. In protest, the Left Front withdrew support from the governing alliance. Singh, however, managed to save both his government and the deal."}
{"context": "'We're having to investigate our grandson", "continuation": "'s death'\n\nTyler Kerry's body was found partially clothed at the bottom of the lift shaft at a hotel in Antalya in Turkey\n\nTyler Kerry spent nine months getting excited for his first family holiday. But less than 36 hours after landing in Turkey, he was found dead at the bottom of a hotel lift shaft. In spite of what police have said, his family believe he was murdered and are trying to investigate themselves.\n\nMr Kerry arrived in Antalya with his grandparents, girlfriend Molly and other relatives on 27 November. The 20-year-old had been enjoying everything the resort in Antalya had to offer, lounging by the pool, having drinks with family and making new friends. Mason Read, his brother, was the last person to see him alive in the early hours of 29 November. He said a group of them were drinking in the lounge area before spending about 10 minutes in a nightclub within the hotel. They returned to the lounge area on the ground floor, where Mr Kerry was last seen by his brother taking off his jacket, T-shirt and shoes and going to sleep on a sofa. \"I went to the bar to get a drink came back and Tyler was not there, his clothes were but his phone wasn’t,\" Mr Read explained. A panicked search throughout the hotel ensued and Mr Read, plus Mr Kerry's girlfriend, found him fatally injured at the bottom of the lift shaft. They said hotel staff pointed to the shaft when asked if they had seen someone matching Mr Kerry's appearance. After he was found, his trousers and a blood-covered vape were found on the first floor of the hotel.\n\nRay and Collette Kerry say they are having to investigate the circumstances surrounding their grandson's death\n\nIn the week since Mr Kerry's death, the family have found themselves bagging up what they consider to be potential evidence, which they hope will be examined by British police. This includes his trousers and bloodied vape. The family also took photos at the hotel of all nearby CCTV cameras and believe some footage has not been reviewed. They said they collected statements and phone numbers from fellow guests and potential witnesses, who they claim have not been spoken to by police.\n\nMrs Kerry said her grandson had always been \"happy and hardworking\"\n\nMrs Kerry said: \"In our country, every bit of evidence would have been taken from the crime scene. \"You wouldn’t have been able to touch that place until forensics had been through it. \"But a couple of hours later, I’m told the lift has been cleaned and is up and running.\"\n\nMr Kerry's aunt, Naomi Kerry, said: \"It's so hard for [the family, they're] going to be living with it for a long time now. \"They have got to do so much digging and can't grieve.\" The family have contacted Essex Police to ask the force to look at the case. Mrs Kerry said: \"This isn't just about my grandson, I don't want anyone else going through this. \"It's all taking its toll, it's hard. Someone needs to step up and do a job, it shouldn't be down to us and social media.\" His family have vowed to \"non-stop fight for justice\".\n\nMr Read and a fellow guest said they felt hotel staff were inappropriate in how they handled the aftermath of Mr Kerry's body being found. Boards brought out to shield the area were covered in Halloween decorations, including ones that had \"blood dripping down\", Mr Read described. \"It was like they were taking the mick,\" he explained. A guest at the hotel told the BBC she also saw the bloody decorations on the board which she felt were inappropriate.\n\nTyler Kerry's family have vowed to keep investigating the circumstances around his death\n\nTyler's grandmother, Collette Kerry, said she was \"absolutely disgusted\" by the police investigation and conclusion. In a statement, the Presidency of the Republic of Turkey said it had investigated the case \"meticulously\" and described Mr Kerry as having fallen from a height. \"There was no proof of firearm or sharp object injuries, there were broken parts - thought as they were owing to the falling down - and intense blood congestion on the head was observed,\" a spokesperson said. \"According to the statements, Mr Kerry went to the club at night and was under the influence of alcohol, died falling down from the first floor.\" They said there was no evidence of \"intervention\" on his body. However, his family believe key evidence was not collected and that Mr Kerry was murdered. The bloodied vape and Tyler's trousers were not collected by police, and were instead given to the family - they said.\n\nMr Read said the investigation had been \"pitiful\" and police needed to do more. \"It’s killing me sitting here thinking of all the things that could have happened to him,\" he said. The family said they were told by other guests that the hotel cleaned up the area around the lift shaft, including blood, and had the lift back in operation within hours of Mr Kerry's body being found. They are concerned potential evidence was lost as a result. A final autopsy result was expected in two months' time, Turkish authorities said.\n\nDo you have a story suggestion for Essex?"}
{"context": "Edmonton Oilers on brink of history after thrilling comeback\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers are facing off the Florida Panthers in the Stanley Cup finals\n\nSome of Shelina Gwaduri's earliest memories are of huddling around the family TV to watch the Edmonton Oilers play. Once, she and her older brother, Karim, went to a game and stayed to meet superstar player Wayne Gretzky, the franchise's captain at the time. “From when I was born basically, the Oilers were in my blood,” the 43-year-old, who now lives in Vancouver, told the BBC. Now, she wears his Oilers jersey during every game, including as she watched her home team clinch a miraculous comeback against the Florida Panthers in this year’s Stanley Cup finals. The Edmonton Oilers are now one win away from earning the greatest prize in the National Hockey League (NHL), playing their final game against Florida on Monday in the best-of-seven series. Should the Oilers succeed, they would become the first Canadian NHL team to win the championship since 1993, when the Montreal Canadiens beat the Los Angeles Kings. It would also be the Oilers' first Stanley Cup win since 1990. But the team is on the precipice of something even rarer: not since 1945 has a team come back from a 3-0 loss to tie a series in the Stanley Cup final. They are only the third team in NHL history to achieve such a feat. And only one other team - the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1942 - came back from such a deficit and won the cup. Fans like Ms Gwaduri say a win for Edmonton would be a significant milestone even in the storied history of the team, which was once home to Gretzky, who many argue is the greatest ice hockey player of all time. His team’s winning streak in the 1980s earned Edmonton the nickname “City of Champions”. A win would also be a point of pride for Canada, where dedicated fans have been anxiously waiting decades to see the Stanley Cup return to the birthplace of modern hockey. Ms Gwaduri said that even her husband, a die-hard fan of the Oilers’ rival team the Vancouver Canucks, is excited about the potential win. “It’s bringing all of us together in the excitement of ‘Oh my god, is this actually happening?’” she said.\n\nShelina Gwaduri pictured on her wedding day nine years ago donning an Edmonton Oilers jersey, while her husband wears a Vancouver Canuck's jersey\n\nOnce arguably the greatest team in the NHL, the Edmonton Oilers have been down on their luck for a long time. In 2006, the team climbed their way to the Stanley Cup finals with the hopes of securing a sixth title, only to suffer a crushing Game 7 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes. The period that followed became known as “The Decade of Darkness”. But in 2015, the Oilers signed Connor McDavid - then a 19-year-old hockey phenom from the Toronto area. The young, gifted player proved to be a generational talent, said Daniel Nugent-Bowman, who covers the franchise for sports publication The Athletic. “That term gets tossed around pretty loosely, but he is the definition of a generational player,” Mr Nugent-Bowman told the BBC. McDavid is known for his dazzling skills on the ice, with a speed and accuracy few other players rival. “If his career ended today, he would be in the Hall of Fame and would go down as one of the greatest hockey players of all time, and that’s at 27 years old, without a Stanley Cup,” Mr Nugent-Bowman said. But it would take nine years after McDavid’s signing for the Oilers to once again compete for the Cup. The dramatic comeback and the team's perseverance against the Florida Panthers only adds to the excitement for Monday. “I’m a big fan of really good stories,” said Travis Sengaus, who cheers for rival team the Calgary Flames but who is excited nonetheless about Edmonton’s success. Mr Sengaus recalled other miraculous rebounds in sports history, like when the Boston Red Sox beat the New York Yankees in the 2004 American League C", "continuation": "hampionship Series, becoming the first - and still only - team to return from a 3-0 series deficit in Major League Baseball. Or when LeBron James’ Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Golden State Warriors in 2016 to win the National Basketball Association championship after trailing behind for much of the series. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball finals of all time. The Oilers, he said, are on the cusp of their own great story - one that's “very hard to resist”.\n\nMcDavid, who plays for Edmonton, is widely considered to be one of the best players in the National Hockey League\n\nThe Florida Panthers, of course, have their own story. A relatively new franchise - created 31 years ago, the same year a Canadian team last won the Stanley Cup - the Miami-based team is hungry for its first-ever championship. They came close last year, but lost four out of five games in the finals to the Vegas Golden Knights. While Florida is not known for its winter sports, ice hockey fandom in the state swelled after the recent success of the Tampa Bay Lightning, who won the Stanley Cup in 2020 and 2021. Ahead of Monday's match-up, Panthers' coach Paul Maurice said he is \"not concerned about the past at all\". \"The concern of the previous three games certainly didn’t affect Edmonton and it won’t affect us,\" he said. Meanwhile, the Oilers' coach Kris Knoblauch said he is just enjoying the ride. \"Not just because we're going to Game 7, but I think we were having a great time when we were down three games,\" he said. The series is being fervently followed by tens of thousands of passionate fans in Edmonton, the northernmost city in North America with a population of just over one million people, known for its freezing cold winters and enduring resolve. Spencer Bennett, a teacher in the Edmonton area, said his school streamed Game 6 during its middle school graduation ceremony. “It was amazing. We were all just cheering and high-fiving and screaming at the top of our lungs,” he said. When he and the students sang Oh Canada when it was played during the game's livestream, it was like “having 16,000 of my closest friends singing our national anthem together”. Mr Nugent-Bowman, who was inside the arena, said it was “the loudest I have ever heard that building”. “Hockey means everything to Edmonton,” he said, even though the younger generations likely cannot recall the heyday of Gretsky’s reign. “There’s been just so many lean years, and people have been waiting so long in Edmonton for another team like that of the 80s.” For Ms Gwaduri, a win is a chance for Edmonton to live up to its nickname once again. “The new generation can now see that this was the City of Champions, and it still is,” she said. She plans on watching the final game of the season with her husband and children, along with extended family members. “It’ll be almost like we’re back in the 80s and 1990 with my family, coming together and watching (the team) potentially holding up that Cup.”"}
{"context": "I hope Assad pays the price, says mother whose son's death inflamed 2011 Syrian revolution\n\nHamza al-Khatib's death sparked protests in 2011 that led to Syria's civil war\n\nIf the push to oust Bashar al-Assad was born anywhere, it was born in Deraa, a small city in Syria near the Jordanian border. Here, on 21 May 2011, the tortured and mutilated body of 13-year-old Hamza al-Khatib was delivered to his family weeks after his arrest at an anti-government rally. His death, and the torture of other local teenagers for writing anti-Assad graffiti, sparked widespread protests and a harsh crackdown by government forces. If anyone in Deraa should be celebrating the fall of Assad's regime, it's the Khatib family. But when we visited today, no one in that house was celebrating. They had just been sent screenshots of documents found in the notorious Saydnaya prison confirming that Hamza's older brother Omar - also arrested by the police in 2019 - had died in custody.\n\nThe boys' mother, Samira, shaking with grief, told me she had been waiting for Omar to emerge from prison. \"I was thinking maybe he'll come today or tomorrow,\" she said. \"Today, I got the news.\" Dressed all in black, and already mourning her husband, who died less than three months ago, she asked for former President Bashar al-Assad himself to experience what she had lived through. \"I hope he will pay the price,\" she said. \"And that God will take revenge on him, and on his children.\"\n\nSamira's grief has been compounded by documents confirming the death of her other son Omar\n\nHer nephew, Hossam al-Khatib, said the documents had been published on social media, by people scouring Saydnaya for information on their relatives. They found Omar's file and shared it online, knowing that he was Hamza's brother. The fall of Assad has lifted the lid on decades of repression in Syria, and much of Deraa was out on the streets on Sunday, giddy with freedom, as rebel fighters took the capital Damascus and Assad fled. Mobile phone footage shows crowds of men running around Deraa's central square in a chaotic outpouring of joy - shouting and firing weapons into the air. This area was a key opposition heartland during the Assad regime - heavy battles are etched onto schools and homes here, village after village corroded by tank rounds and machine gun fire. The opposition in this southern part of Syria is different to the alliance led by Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which swept down from the north and took the capital last week. But they both converged on the capital on Sunday. The Free Syria Army (FSA) began fighting here in 2011, when the harsh government crackdowns following Hamza's death convinced some serving officers in Assad's army to defect and form a rebe", "continuation": "l force.\n\nOne of them was Ahmed al-Awda, a poet who studied English literature at university before becoming an army officer, and then a rebel leader - now the militia leader of Deraa Province. \"You can't imagine how happy we are,\" he told me in the nearby town of Busra. \"We have been crying for days. You can't imagine what we feel. Everyone here in Syria lost family. Everyone was suffering.\" Mr Awda said he was among the first to enter Damascus on Sunday, along with HTS. The first thing he did, he added, was to go to the embassies and government buildings, to protect the people inside. \"We took many of the civilian government guys to the Four Seasons hotel, and put a very big force there to protect them,\" he said. \"You know it will be a mad time, so I did my best to protect everybody there, even the government guys. I don't want to punish them, they are Syrian.\" But he says he won't forgive Assad so easily. \"I will do my best to bring him to judgement in court, to take his punishment, because we will not forget what he did to the Syrian people, and how he destroyed Syria.\" Assad's departure has bestowed a fragile unity on Syria and its diverse opposition forces. But they no longer have a common enemy, and with outside powers still invested here, their differences could come under strain. There are concerns that Syria could follow the path of Iraq and Libya and splinter into chaos. \"We saw what happened in Iraq and we refuse it,\" Mr Awda said. Assad's forces weren't the only ones he was fighting here over the past few years. Islamic State (IS) group cells - still scattered across the east of the country - were also a threat.\n\nWomen watch as the new Syrian flag, used by the opposition, is unfurled\n\nMr Awda says he fought against them, killing a senior IS leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Qurayshi, two years ago. Now Assad's powerful backers, Iran and Russia, are no longer acting as a brake on IS, many here are worried about a resurgence. Mr Awda is adamant this won't happen. \"No,\" he insisted. \"I kicked them out. We didn't push Assad out only to live under IS.\" Now he wants free elections, believing that the Syrian people will never again choose anyone who would become a dictator. In Deraa's cemetery, the plaque on Hamza's grave lies in pieces - broken by a government tank shell during fighting with rebel forces here, the family said. \"They kept hitting him even when he was dead,\" one cousin remarked. Neighbours watched in silence as the Syrian opposition flag was tied around Hamza's headstone. Behind it, the graves tell a story of 13 years of fighting: an air strike, a battle, a whole family killed in their home. The war with Assad has ended - but peace in Syria has not yet been won."}

The complaints, filed separately in New York Supreme Court on Thursday, involve incidents that allegedly occurred between 2019-22. Two of the plaintiffs allege they went to parties with Mr Combs, where he \"personally offered\" them alcoholic drinks which made them unconscious, before they say he raped them. The rapper's lawyers dismissed the lawsuits calling them \"full of lies\". He remains in custody at a Brooklyn jail.\n\n\"We will prove them false and seek sanctions agains", "continuation": "t every unethical lawyer who filed fictional claims against him,\" the rapper's legal team told the BBC in a statement. The three lawsuits add to over 30 civil cases filed against Mr Combs, many of which involve similar accusations of sexual assaults dating back to the 1990s. The rapper has been denied bail three times and is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Thomas Giuffra, the attorney who filed the three lawsuits on behalf of his clients, told the BBC in an interview that more than 60 people have reached out to his office with claims against Mr Combs. He said his office had investigated each of the claims and decided to move forward with these three cases. He said the men decided to file the lawsuits anonymously because they're afraid of Mr Combs and his reach and influence.\n\nIn one of the new lawsuits, an anonymous plaintiff listed as John Doe accuses Mr Combs of assault following an encounter at the Marquee nightclub in New York in 2019. According to his complaint, he joined Mr Combs and 10 other individuals for a private afterparty when the hip-hop mogul \"personally offered\" him a cocktail, after which he felt disoriented. The man alleges that Mr Combs noticed his disoriented state and said: \"He is ready to party.\" The man claims he blacked out and during brief moments of consciousness, he said he noticed a man and a woman recording as he was being raped by the musician. The following morning, the man claims he was given about $2,500 (£2,000) by the man and woman recording the assault, who said the money came from Mr Combs. Another anonymous plaintiff alleges that he attended a party at Mr Combs' East Hampton home in the summer of 2020. After consuming alcohol provided by Mr Combs, the man claims he began to lose consciousness. While \"fading in and out of consciousness\", he alleges that Mr Combs and others from Bad Boys Entertainment \"took turns raping him\". The third anonymous man claims he met Mr Combs in 2006 and began working for him. He alleges that in February 2020, he met Mr Combs at a hotel to discuss unpaid wages and during that meeting, he claims the rapper prepared him a drink that he believes was drugged. He says he lost consciousness and woke up to find Mr Combs assaulting him. Mr Combs allegedly told him he would look like an idiot if he went to the police and that no-one would ever believe him, the lawsuit states. Mr Combs is also separately facing federal criminal charges in a sex-trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. Mr Combs has pleaded not guilty to all the accusations. His legal team has repeatedly asserted his innocence. The trial is scheduled for May."}

One described an apocalyptic war on Jews.\n\nThe group that promoted the online talks said it respects all communities.\n\nThe footage - which also includes a denial of the Holocaust - adds to growing concerns from some MPs that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is attempting to radicalise UK Muslims. Security services have also warned it is inciting violence and plotting to kidnap or kill people on British soil.\n\nOne of the most powerful paramilitary organisations in the Middle East, the IRGC controls the Iranian government's foreign covert operations and supports militant groups such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nThe IRGC has previously been linked to kidnap and assassination plots in the UK. Counter-terror police confirmed in February last year that 15 such plots had come out of Iran since 2020, and the BBC has since been told there has been at least one more.\n\nThe IRGC is one of the most powerful paramilitary organisations in the Middle East\n\nThe videos seen by the BBC were recorded in 2020 and 2021 and show three events.\n\nTwo were live-streamed speeches by former and active IRGC commanders.\n\nThe other was an in-person event inside the Kanoon Towhid Islamic centre in west London, commemorating Iran's top military commander Gen Qasem Soleimani, who was killed in a US air strike in 2020. Chants of \"death to Israel\" were heard at the event, but it is not known who was saying them.\n\nThe BBC has also seen evidence of another online talk to UK students by an IRGC commander who has since boasted of his role in training Hamas before the 7 October attacks.\n\nThe online talks were promoted in advance by the Islamic Students Associations of Britain (ISA) and its affiliates, which use the Kanoon Towhid centre as a meeting place. Unlike the UK's main Muslim student groups, the ISA was founded to promote the philosophy of the leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini.\n\nKanoon Towhid is owned by the Al-Tawheed (TUCF) Charitable Trust. The trust was already being investigated by the Charity Commission after reports of the event honouring Gen Soleimani, who was sanctioned by the UK for his links to terrorism. The commission is now examining the videos seen by the BBC, which include footage of this event.\n\nThe commission's chair, Orlando Fraser, has previously warned that charities must not \"become forums for hate speech\" or extremism. The Charity Commission has the power to investigate, sanction or close down charities which breach the regulations.\n\nConservative MP Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, described the speeches as a \"brazen act ", "continuation": "of radicalisation\". She said the IRGC should be added to the list of proscribed terrorist groups in the UK, meaning it would be illegal to be an IRGC member or to show support for them.\n\nIn one recording - an Instagram Live from Iran in September 2020 which has been viewed about 1,500 times - IRGC commander Hossein Yekta said universities had become \"the battlefront\" and urged the students listening to become \"soft-war officers\".\n\nIRGC Gen Hossein Yekta (right) told UK students that universities had become a \"battleground\"\n\nKasra Aarabi - director of IRGC research at the US-based campaign group United Against Nuclear Iran, and who shared the videos with the BBC - said \"soft-war officers\" is a term used by Iran to describe recruits to its ideological battle with the West. He said it was coined by a branch of the IRGC, \"which today is proactively conducting terror plots on British soil\".\n\nAli Ansari, a professor of Iranian history at the University of St Andrews, said the talks reflected \"an attempt to encourage disruption, discontent, and basically undermine the stability of Western society, and what we need is a much more robust response to it\".\n\nProf Ansari said proscribing the IRGC as a terrorist organisation would be difficult, as it is an arm of the Iranian state. But he said the UK government could still shut down its activities.\n\nThe other video of an online talk seen by the BBC, this time from January 2021, again glorified the death of Gen Soleimani.\n\nSeen by tens of thousands of people, the video shows former IRGC commander Gen Saeed Ghasemi comparing Soleimani's death to the Hollywood film Terminator 2, saying that after Soleimani was attacked, the broken pieces would come back together, stronger than before.\n\nKasra Aarabi from United Against a Nuclear Iran said the IRGC is actively plotting terror attacks on UK soil\n\n\"You killed Qasem,\" he said, referring to the US, \"but he shattered into millions of hearts in the Islamic world. You can no longer stand in his way.\"\n\nIn the footage, Gen Ghasemi also falsely claimed the Holocaust was \"a lie and a fake\" and described an apocalyptic war that the British students could join to \"bring an end to the life of the oppressors and occupiers, Zionists and Jews across the world\".\n\nHe added: \"God willing, myself and you good students in Europe will be written in the beautiful list of the soldiers of the resistance from tonight.\"\n\nIn addition to the videos, the BBC has seen promotional posts dating from November 2020 for another talk to British students featuring elite former IRGC commander Ezzatollah Zarghami. Mr Zarghami, who is sanctioned in the UK for human rights abuses, posted a picture of himself on his Telegram social media account speaking live over Zoom on the evening of the talk.\n\nMr Zarghami was part of a group of radical students who stormed the US embassy in Tehran in 1979, holding Americans hostage for more than a year. He is currently the minister of Cultural Heritage and Tourism in Iran and has since boasted of training Hamas in Gaza prior to the 7 October attacks.

The aim was to get the rocket's upper section - the Ship - to make a controlled return into the atmosphere and then to ditch in the Indian Ocean. And it achieved its objective, descending broadly intact all the way to the sea surface. Video from the vehicle indicated it was falling apart at the end, but still operating. \"Splashdown confirmed! Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting fourth flight test of Starship!\" the company said on X. Earlier in the flight, the lower booster part of the rocket was brought back down to the Gulf of Mexico, to hover just above the water. That’s also a big step forward from previous test flights when the booster was destroyed in flight.\n\nThursday's mission was the latest stage in the American entrepreneur and his SpaceX company's quest to develop a fully and rapidly re-useable orbital rocket system - something that would be a world first. Starship launches from an R&D facility at Boca Chica, a small town on the Texas coastline. The initial stages of the ascent followed the same profile as the three prior test outings, with the Ship and booster separating two and three-quarter minutes after leaving the ground. While the Ship pressed on out over the Atlantic, the lower-stage of the rocket headed back to a drop point near shore. Using its engines, the booster deftly brought itself to a stop above the sea surface before pitching over. The manoeuvre was a prelude to future landings back at Boca Chica itself.\n\nAs the Ship came back through the atmosphere, it experienced extreme temperatures\n\nThe Ship's difficulty is that it flies higher and faster, which means when it comes home it is exposed to the blistering temperatures of re-entry. A colourful plasma - super-heated, ionised gas - was seen to envelop the vehicle as it dived deeper into the atmosphere. Late into the descent, heat-protection tiles started to come away; some structural elements began to glow red hot; and the camera view became obscured when the lens cracked. But even in this ragged state, the Ship still managed to execute a virtual landing on water. Quite how finessed that landing was, future analysis of the data will tell. Overall, however, this mission marked significant progress for Mr Musk and SpaceX, external. \"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean! Congratulations @SpaceX team on an epic achievement!!\" Mr Musk wrote on X.\n\nThe Super Heavy booster was brought to a hover stop just above the Gulf's waters\n\nThe 33 engines at its base produce 74 meganewtons of thrust. To put that in context, the US space agency's (Nasa) biggest rocket - the Space Launch System, or SLS - produces 39 meganewtons off the pad, and that's over 20% more than the old space shuttle system could generate. If SpaceX engineers can perfect Starship, it will be revolutionary. It's intended to operate much like an aeroplane that can be refuelled and put back in the air in quick order. This capability, along with the heft to carry more than a hundred tonnes to orbit in one go, would radically lower the cost of space activity and make possible new types of activity.\n\nFor Elon Musk, Starship is key to realising his long-held ambition of taking people and supplies to Mars to build a human settlement. It will also assist his Starlink project which is establishing a global network of broadband internet s", "continuation": "atellites. There are thousands of Starlink spacecraft in orbit already, but later models will be larger and heavier and Starship will be needed to get them to space. Among the keenest observers of the test flights in Texas is Nasa. Starship is critical to the agency's Artemis programme to put astronauts back on the Moon this decade. A version of Starship would act as the landing craft, taking the crew from lunar orbit down to the surface - and then lifting them back off again. SpaceX, however, will first have to show it can produce a safe and reliable vehicle before astronauts are permitted to climb aboard. Nasa has scheduled late 2026 for when it would like to see boots back on the lunar surface. \"Congratulations @SpaceX on Starship's successful test flight this morning! We are another step closer to returning humanity to the Moon through #Artemis - then looking onward to Mars,\" said Nasa administrator Bill Nelson. In other space news on Thursday, the Boeing company's new astronaut capsule docked with the International Space Station (ISS). Known as Starliner, the vehicle is on its first crewed test flight. After experiencing some technical difficulties with the operation of small thrusters, the capsule drove itself on to an attachment point on the front of the ISS at 17:34 GMT. Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will stay just over the week in orbit before bringing Starliner home to a landing in the southwestern US, most probably White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.\n\nAs with earlier test flights, large crowds had gathered to watch the lift-off"}
{"context": "The US Supreme Court accidentally leaked a major opinion on abortion rights, appearing ready to overturn part of Idaho's near-total ban. According to a document published on the court's website then quickly removed, justices will rule that Idaho cannot deny emergency abortions to women whose health is in danger. The court said the opinion, initially obtained by Bloomberg, was \"inadvertently and briefly\" published, and that its final decision had \"not been released\" but would be presented in due course. Its publication however comes two years after the leaking of the court's decision to overturn the national right to abortion access, known as Roe v Wade. Since then, a patchwork of abortion laws has been established as more conservative states, such as Idaho, restrict rights to the procedure. The state is one of 14 banning abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with extremely limited exceptions. It has defended its ban, saying that it allows abortions to save a patient's life and that it is not legally required to expand those exceptions. The state's attorneys have said that the law, therefore, is not in conflict with federal law. The court opinion on Idaho, which was published in full by Bloomberg, suggested that justices would rule 6-3 that it should not have become involved in the case so quickly. Conservative justice Amy Coney Barrett, along with John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh, wrote that the Supreme Court's intervention was premature as positions on the matter are \"still evolving\". The report added that the court would reinstate an order that permitted Idaho hospitals to perform emergency abortions to protect patients' health. If that is so, the case would continue at a federal appeals court.\n\nAccording to the document posted by Bloomberg, one of the court's liberal justices, Ketanji Brown Jackson, noted in her opinion that she wanted a solid ruling, rather than a dismissal that moved the case back to another court. \"Today's decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho. It is delay,\" Justice Jackson wrote. \"While this court dawdles and the country waits, pregnant people experiencing emergency medical conditions remain in a precarious position, as their doctors are kept in the dark about what the law requires. The accidental publication of the ruling, however, was swiftly met with cautious optimism from pro-abortion groups. \"With lives hanging in the balance, we hope this indicates a step forward for patients' access to emergency abortion care,\" the Pro-Choice Caucus of the US Congress posted online. \"Now, it is up to Scotus [the Supreme Court] to confirm that this is true and they will indeed protect that right and uphold federal law,\" the caucus added. Alexis McGill Johnson, the president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood, said that \"any decision that falls short of guaranteeing patients' access to abortion care in emergencies would be catastrophic\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Kamala Harris on Roe v Wade: 'I eat no for breakfast'\n\nThe Biden administration sued Idaho over its near-total abortion ban in 2022, with Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra saying that \"women should not have to be near death to get care\". Idaho countered, saying that the federal law - known as Emergency Medical Treatment and Labour Act or Emtala - cannot supersede state law. In a statement in April, the prominent anti-abortion group Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America called the Biden administration's lawsuit a \"PR stunt\" to spread \"abortion lobby misinformation\". \"The Emtala case is based on the false premise that pregnant women cannot receive emergency care under pro-life laws,\" said the organisation's public affairs director, Kelsey Pritchard. “It is a clear fact that pregnant women can receive miscarriage care, ectopic pregnancy care and treatment in a medical emergency in all 50 states,\" she added. The court's nine justices appeared divided during earlier arguments on the case in April. In the document leaked on Wednesday, most of the court's conservative justices suggested that they were sympathetic to Idaho's case that doctors could not be compelled to break state law because of Emtala. The three liberal justices - Sonya Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ms Jackson - on the other hand, all seemed doubtful that Idaho could, under Emtala, deny abortions to pregnant women facing serious health concerns. In April, the Associated Press reported that at least", "continuation": " six pregnant women had to be airlifted out of the state for emergencies since the law came into effect in January. In 2023, by comparison, one patient required a similar emergency airlift.

The decision, which came two years after the court rescinded the nationwide guarantee to an abortion, was welcomed by pro-choice activists."}
{"context": "Dominic Chappell was jailed for tax evasion in 2020\n\nEx-BHS director Dominic Chappell has been ordered to pay £50m to cover losses the firm incurred before its collapse. A High Court judge said Mr Chappell tried to “plunder the BHS Group whenever possible\" after he bought the company for £1 from Sir Phillip Green in 2015. The ex-director was imprisoned for six years in 2020 over tax evasion. He has since been sued by BHS liquidators FRP Advisory.\n\nAt a hearing on Tuesday, Mr Justice Leech said Mr Chappell never had a realistic plan to secure capital for the company when he acquired it. The judge also said Mr Chappell “should make the payments” outlined, which includes £21.5m for wrongful trading. He must also pay £17.5m for breach of fiduciary duty and other additional costs. This takes the total to over £50m but Mr Chappell still faces another fine over a misfeasance or wrongful trading claim. The amount he has to pay for that will be determined at a later date. Mr Chappell gave a hand written note to the judge saying he had no legal counsel \"due to lack of funds” and raised health and computer access concerns. Mr Chappell is a former racing driver and had no retail experience when he bought BHS for £1 in March 2015. The firm made headlines when it fell into administration with a billion pounds worth of trading liabilities and pension debts in 2016. Just over a year into the new ownership the chain went under, resulting in 11,000 job losses and a £571m pensions shortfall.

Ruse then swung freely and her attacks earned back the first break back before she saved the first two match points. When Raducanu double-faulted while handing back the second break, the Romanian looked favourite at 5-5.

{"context": "The UK's indefinite ban on giving puberty blockers to under-18s questioning their gender identity will be followed in Scotland, ", "continuation": "the government at Holyrood has said. UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting told MPs he was extending the temporary ban introduced in May following a consultation and advice from the Commission on Human Medicines. Streeting called the way the drugs had been used a \"scandal\". The Scottish government confirmed that since medicines policy was reserved to Westminster, the ban would apply across England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nCampaigners on both sides have reacted to the news, with those in support of the ban commending its \"integrity\" and those against calling it \"discrimination\". Puberty blockers are drugs used to delay or prevent puberty happening. Ministers at Holyrood were advised by an independent panel in July to suspend the use of the drugs until further research had been carried out. The advice was one of several recommendations from a team looking into how the landmark review by paediatrician Dr Hilary Cass on gender services for children and young people could be applied in Scotland. In April, Scotland's NHS confirmed it had paused prescribing puberty blockers to children referred by its specialist gender clinic, The Sandyford in Glasgow. Following the UK health secretary's announcement, the Scottish government confirmed the indefinite ban would also apply north of the border. A spokesperson said: \"The UK government has laid legislation to put in place an indefinite ban on new children and young people aged under 18 years from beginning to take puberty blockers for the purposes of gender incongruence and/or gender dysphoria, under the care of private or non-UK prescribers. \"As medicines policy is reserved to the UK government, this measure will apply to England, Scotland and Wales.\"\n\nPro-trans activists protested outside the Sandyford clinic in Glasgow in March\n\nThe UK government had consulted the Commission on Human Medicines on the issue, with the expert group concluding that prescribing the drugs to children for gender dysphoria was an \"unacceptable safety risk\". A temporary ban was put in place by the last Conservative government, and had been renewed twice since Labour came to power. Wes Streeting said on Monday that the UK review identified cases where children had been prescribed the treatment after filling out an online form and only having one online consultation with a healthcare provider. The Cass review had found a lack of evidence around treatment for under-18s with puberty-blocking drugs. At the time of publication it was criticised by the Scottish Greens, who at that stage were part of the Scottish government. Glasgow's Sandyford Clinic took the decision to stop new patients aged 16 or 17 receiving other hormone treatments until they were 18, a decision that was criticised by the charity Scottish Trans. Like other parts of the UK, Scotland has seen a surge in the number of young people questioning their identity or experiencing gender dysphoria. The Sandyford is the only specialist service for under-18s in Scotland. A freedom of information request from BBC Scotland News revealed that 1,100 patients were on the waiting list for the centre at the end of 2023. In Scotland, 43 patients have continued to receive either puberty blockers or \"gender affirming hormones\" such as testosterone or oestrogen, as they were prescribed the treatments before the April decision was made."}

They say 10 other troops were wounded in the fighting on Tuesday near the Mediterranean port of Tartous, a stronghold of Assad's minority Alawite Muslim sect. The clashes with pro-Assad loyalists are the first direct challenge to the authority of Syria's de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa.

Sana reported that the forces had \"neutralised... a number of remnants of Assad's militias\" in the Tartous countryside, and that it was pursuing others. Reports say the security forces had earlier been ambushed as they tried to arrest a former officer in connection to his role at the", "continuation": " notorious Saydnaya prison, close to the capital, Damascus. The UK-based monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said three \"armed men\", which it did not identify, were also killed in the clashes. The SOHR added that the security forces later brought in reinforcements. On Thursday, it said the former officer, Mohammed Kanjo Hassan, had been arrested together with 20 other people. The claim has not been independently verified. In a separate development, the Syrian authorities imposed an overnight curfew into Thursday in the central city of Homs, state media reported. Reports say this followed unrest over a video purportedly showing an attack on an Alawite shrine. The interior ministry said the footage was old, dating back to a rebel offensive on Aleppo in late November, and the violence was carried out by unknown groups. The SOHR said one demonstrator was killed and five wounded in Homs. The former rebels now in charge of Syria are grappling with the challenge of providing safety and stability across the country. Syrians are looking to them to protect the rights of people from a variety of backgrounds as well as providing justice for those who lost relatives under the Assad dictatorship. Demonstrations have also been reported in Alawite-dominated areas including the cities of Tartous and Latakia, and Assad's hometown of Qardaha. Alawites are an offshoot of Shia Islam to which many of the former regime's political and military elite belonged, including Assad's family. The Alawite community is fearful of revenge, with members blamed for the torture and killing in Syria under Assad. Former officers are refusing to hand over weapons and locals in some towns suggest they want to fight back, which appears to have been the case in Tartous. There have been calls from Alawite religious leaders for a general amnesty for Alawites - but this is unlikely because of the many alleged war crimes conducted by its members. Although al-Sharaa has bolstered security in Alawite towns and cities in an attempt to maintain order, if his forces do launch a campaign to arrest Assad loyalists, they risk further destabilising an already fragile country. Tens of thousands of people were tortured to death in prisons in Syria, and thousands of families are still waiting for answers and for justice. Syrians are calling for those responsible to be held to account - the very thing that members of the Alawite are worried about. The HTS-led lightning offensive that started from Syria's north-east and spread across the country ended more than 50 years of rule by the Assads. Assad and his family were forced to flee to Russia. HTS has since promised to protect the rights and freedoms of many religious and ethnic minorities in Syria. The group is designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, the US, the EU, the UK and others.

Wisdom, a Laysan albatross, was filmed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) at the Midway Atoll national wildlife refuge in the Pacific Ocean with her latest partner looking after the egg. Members of the species usually only live for 12-40 years, but Wisdom was tagged in 1956 when she was about five. Her last offspring hatched in 2021. She is thought to have had more than 30 chicks in her lifetime.\n\nThe USFWS said on X that Wisdom was with a new partner this year and that her previous partner Akeakamai had not been seen for several years. The species generally mates for life but she is already thought to have outlived at least three mates. Jon Plissner, supervisory wildlife biologist at the refuge, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Wisdom was one of two to three million Laysan albatrosses who travel to Midway to breed. He said biologists were unaware of any other birds even close to her age, the oldest being 45. \"It's really been remarkable,\" he said. \"Wisdom seems to pique the interest of people across the world. We wait each year with bated breath for her return.\" He said Wisdom still appeared to have the energy and instincts to raise another chick, and that there was a 70-80% chance of the egg hatching. Albatross parents share incubation duties and, once the chick hatches, feeding duties. Wisdom was first identified and tagged in 1956 after laying an egg. Laysan albatrosses are not known to breed before the age of five. Midway Atoll is part of the Hawaiian archipelago but does not fall within the US state of Hawaii and is described as an unincorporated territory of the US. The wildlife refuge is home to the largest colony of albatross in the world."}

{"context": "A baroness who called a peer of Indian origin \"Lord Poppadom\" is facing a suspension from the House of Lords after an investigation found her comments amounted to harassment \"related to race\". The Lords' Conduct Committee recommended suspending Conservative Baroness Meyer for three weeks. It also rebuked her for touching a black MP's hair without permission. She initially denied making the remarks, but later apologised for both incidents. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said people should \"treat each other with respect\". The committee also recommended suspending Lord Stone of Blackheath, a former Labour peer, for six months for bullying, after he called security staff \"thick\" and \"stupid\".\n\nThe committee upheld a complaint that Lady Meyer twice used the derogatory term to refer to Lord Dholakia during a taxi ride during a visit to Rwanda with parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights in February. The comments came after Lady Meyer had earlier mistaken him for Lord Popat, another peer of southeast Asian heritage, the report states. Lord Dholakia was in the car but did not initially hear the comments. Others on the committee confronted her over the remarks, including Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the report heard. Lady Meyer initially denied using the term, but faced with evidence from two witnesses she admitted she may have said it - blaming a long day and a dinner where she drank \"possibly three glasses of wine\". The investigation found Lady Meyer's behaviour towards Lord Dholakia had breached harassment rules with a \"racial element\". She then asked Ribeiro-Addy if she could touch her braids, and did so before receiving a reply. Ribeiro-Addy said she laughed off the incident but said it made her feel \"extremely uncomfortable\". Lady Meyer said she saw Ribeiro-Addy's reaction and instantly regretted her actions. The report noted that she had apologised for her actions in both cases. Alongside the three-week suspension, the committee recommended Lady Meyer be made to take bespoke behaviour training. Catherine Meyer, who is 71, co-founded International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children and is the widow of the former UK ambassador to the US Sir Christopher Meyer. She was appointed to the House of Lords by Theresa May in 2018. Asked about the committee's findings during a visit to Essex on Friday, Badenoch said it was important the rulings were followed. \"We need to make sure that we all treat each other with respect at all times,\" she added. Earlier, Conservative peer Lord Greenhalgh said he was \"surprised and disappointed\" by Lady Meyer's comments. \"The use of that sort of language is not what I would have expected from my Conservative colleague,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAfter a separate investigation the committee called for Lord Stone to be suspended for six months after finding he had bullied parliamentary security staff. The former Marks and Spencer executive admitted to using an \"aggressive\"", "continuation": " tone when contacted by security staff after leaving his suitcase unattended by an entrance to the parliamentary estate, contrary to the rules. The report said: \"In subsequent exchanges with security officers, on the telephone and in person, Lord Stone raised his voice, gesticulated, spoke over them and described (an officer) as 'thick and stupid'.\" He refused to move his suitcase and used rude and offensive language. Lord Stone appealed against an initial investigation by the Lords' Standards Commissioner that found he had bullied the staff, but the Conduct Committee upheld the findings. He had previously been found to have sexually harassed staff by the Commissioner in 2019, leading to him losing the Labour whip. After two allegations against him were upheld, he agreed to take part in a course of \"bespoke training and behaviour coaching sessions\". In Thursday's report, the committee said: \"The present case demonstrates that the clear pattern of Lord Stone's poor behaviour continues. \"Despite the hope we expressed in 2020, Lord Stone appears to have no greater insight into his behaviour now than he did then. \"His continued inability to control his behaviour and to treat staff with respect and courtesy is unacceptable.\" Peers need to approve the sanctions before they can be implemented, with votes to do so expected early in 2025."}
{"context": "Parents say son's abusers given slap on the wrist\n\nThe parents of a 14-year-old boy who was tied to a chair and forced to apologise for being gay say the teenagers involved have been given a \"slap on the wrist\" by Scotland's justice system. A video clip viewed by the BBC shows the boy sitting in a derelict building with his wrists bound and a stick placed at this throat. Police arrested two 16-year-olds and a 15-year-old and charged them in connection with an abduction and assault but none were taken to court, despite Scotland's top law officer describing the incident as \"a horrendous experience\". Instead the case was referred to the Scottish Children's Reporter Admin", "continuation": "istration (SCRA), which appointed a social worker to work with one of the youths. The boy’s parents have not been told what action if any was taken in respect of the two other teenagers. The SCRA told the BBC rules on confidentiality limit what it can disclose about its decisions. Scottish government policy is to avoid sending children to the criminal justice system whenever possible and to support them to change their behaviour. The boy's mother said: \"Our view was that this was a hate crime. \"We feel that we've all been traumatised by the system and the lack of support and justice for our son, who was clearly the victim of serious crimes.\" The incident last summer was followed by another assault on the boy in January this year. That too resulted in the alleged perpetrator being referred to the Children's Reporter. None of the individuals involved can be named because of their age.\n\nThe boy's mother and father say another parent sent them a video of the first incident on the night it took place in Glasgow. Their son told them he had gone to the building with friends and was assaulted by the other teenagers after they made him admit he was gay. His mother said: \"The video showed our son with his wrists bound, tied to a chair. He looked to be in distress and there was a stick being pushed under his throat. \"The boy that was pushing the stick was saying 'say sorry'. I felt like I'd been punched in the stomach.\" The mother says her son told her there was a petrol can in the room and he was hit with the stick. \"It haunts us, thinking what must have been going through his head, knowing he couldn't escape,\" she says. \"He was told things like he would get his head cut off in Iran for being gay.\" Their son said he was freed after the teenagers heard sirens in the distance.\n\n“The parents praised the \"fantastic\" response from Police Scotland, saying uniformed officers and detectives told them the case would be taken seriously. The family believed the case was going to be dealt with at Glasgow Sheriff Court but after making inquiries, they learned it had been referred to the Children's Reporter. They say that in the weeks that followed, they struggled to find out what was happening. In March this year, more than eight months after the incident, the SCRA wrote to tell them the final outcome. A social worker was to work with one of the teenagers \"on their behaviour and any other issues in their life\". The SCRA decided not to refer any of the three teenagers to a children's hearing, a process which can lead to the imposition of compulsory supervision orders. The boy's father said: \"I just couldn't believe that they had chosen that route. We're in an absolute state of shock.\" \"We understand that Scotland and society doesn’t want to unduly criminalise children but we feel the only deterrent for these boys to never terrorise anyone like this again was for them to be dealt with in court,” the boy's mother says.\n\nThe parents say their son, now 15, has left school because he no longer feels safe. They worry about him every time he leaves home. Scottish Conservative MSP Russell Findlay raised the case with the head of Scotland's prosecution service, Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC. She told him the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) had taken considerable time to consider all of the evidence. Ms Bain wrote: \"I do appreciate that this must have been a horrendous experience for your constituent's son.\" The lord advocate said the decisions on the case were taken by the Crown in consultation with the SCRA. She said they had to balance the undoubted seriousness of the offence with the best interests of the child victim and the child suspects. They also had to consider what the outcome would be if the case was sent to court. The lord advocate said the decision to refer the case to the SCRA was final and could not be appealed. She said an error had led to the parents not being informed of the decision and apologised. Mr Findlay said: \"Instead of being treated as a criminal matter, it was diverted to a process whereby the alleged perpetrators' interests were prioritised. \"If that's the direction of travel, the justice system at the very least has to be upfront with the victims and the victims' families.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the COPFS said: \"We appreciate the impact this traumatic experience has caused the victim and their family. \"As public prosecutors, and in keeping with our legal obligations, we require to make decisions considering the rights of all children involved in a case, who must be treated differently from adults in the criminal justice system. “COPFS and partner agencies are committed to improving the experiences of victims and witnesses, who are at the heart of what we do.\" The Scottish government told BBC Scotland News that any violence was unacceptable. A spokesperson said: \"Taking action to improve the experiences of child victims and their families is a key priority in the Children (Care and Justice) Act which has wide-ranging measures to ensure age-appropriate justice is delivered, keeping children out of prison and introducing a new victims’ single point of contact service. “By addressing young people’s underlying needs, our approach to youth justice has delivered major reductions to Reporter referrals, court appearances and custody over the past 10 years.” The Scottish Children's Reporter Administration said the Children’s Hearings system uses the same requirements for evidence as the courts. A child could only be referred to a hearing if there was sufficient evidence and a need for compulsory supervision. A spokesman said: “We are required by law to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to every child referred to us. “Confidentiality and privacy sometimes mean we are unable to provide victims, or the general public with information that may more full explain our decisions.”"}

Deep inside, Britain's Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron, in black loafers and sweater, attempted to push a pallet of humanitarian aid for Gaza into the aircraft. It wouldn't budge.\n\nHe stepped back while burly Qatari airmen in combat fatigues made some adjustments. But the former British prime minister wasn't giving up, and with a sudden shift, the bundle - part of nearly 30 tonnes of aid including tents and food - began to move into the belly of the plane.\n\nLord Cameron's latest Middle East tour was aimed at helping to broker a permanent ceasefire to the conflict, the release of the more than 132 remaining hostages, and an increase in the aid getting into Gaza on a daily basis.

There's a chasm between the aid Gaza needs, and will need for years to come, and what it is currently receiving.\n\nWhile Israel's bombardment of Gaza continues, the flow of aid is being drip-fed into the strip.

One recent consignment from a foreign donor was full of covid tests, she said.\n\nAs the cargo plane filled with tents climbed slowly into the clear blue desert sky, Lolwah Al-Khater had one final point to make: \"It's very important to emphasise,\" she said, \"that aid can never and should never be substituting the need for an immediate and a permanent ceasefire.\n\n\"Unfortunately, some actors have been trying to promote that we need more aid without doing enough on the other front.\"\n\nThe situation inside Gaza is dire - at least 1.7m people have been displaced, some multiple times. The 285 family tents from Qatar and Britain will go to Unicef in Gaza and house up to five people in each tent.

He said he had a \"stewardess fantasy\" at the time he tried to force two air hostesses to get off a train in the space of three days in August 2006. The defendant was handed a sentence of 12 months, suspended for two years, for his first offences, before he was jailed for 32 months for the false imprisonments.\n\nGavin Plumb said his weight - which at its highest reached 35.5st (225kg) - affected his mental health throughout his life\n\nThe 37-year-old claimed his offences were a \"cry for help\" as he \"needed to get out\" of a toxic relationship. Asked by prosecutor Alison Morgan KC what it felt like \"when you put that tape around the wrists of that girl\" in a shop in 2008, Mr Plumb replied: \"I was scared.\"\n\nThe trial was previously told that Mr Plumb \"spent many hours planning an attack\" on Ms Willoughby \"that would involve violence, rape and ultimately murder\". He is alleged to have shared these plans with two other people online, including a vision of using chloroform to incapacitate the broadcaster after breaking into her house. Asked about the allegations, Mr Plumb admitted he had \"dark\" chats about her online after watching her on daytime TV. \"It's not the sort of route I would normally go down for a chat, but it was a chat that I was having,\" the defendant said. \"Looking back at it now, it's something that is massively regrettable because it's not the usual chat I would participate in.\" When asked why he continued to participate, Mr Plumb responded: \"It's going to sound really bad, but it was gratification. \"It was something I knew that was never going to happen, I'm just passing the time chatting.\"\n\nThe jury was shown an image of Gavin Plumb's bedroom, where it is alleged he masterminded the plot from\n\nThe defendant said he was \"regularly friend-zoned\" in his teenage years - told by girls he fancied that they would only ever be friends.

The visit of the vessels - which include a nuclear-powered submarine and a frigate - have been seen as a show of force amid Moscow's tensions with the West over the war in Ukraine. They are anchored at the Havana Bay - some 90 miles (145km) from the US state of Florida. \"We of course take it seriously, but these exercises don't pose a threat to the United States,\" the Pentagon said. The Russian moves were consistent with \"routine naval visits that we've seen under different administrations,\" press secretary Sabrina Singh added. Russia's defence ministry says the Admiral Gorshkov frigate and the Kazan submarine are both carriers of advanced weapons, including hypersonic missiles Zircon. They earlier conducted missile drills in the Atlantic. But Cuba's foreign ministry says none of the vessels has nuclear arms on board, and their five-day visit does not pose a threat to the region. US officials say they are closely monitoring the visit. The US Navy also used sea drones to shadow the Russian vessels as they got close to Cuba, BBC's US partner CBS reports.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nEarly on a grey and overcast morning, the Russian vessels entered Havana Bay, flanked by smaller support vessels, to a 21-gun salute. In a statement, Russia's defence minister said the visit was unofficial, allowing the vessels' crews to \"rest and get acquainted with local attractions\". Russia has sent warships to Cuba in the past and the two nations are long-standing allies - but the timing of these particular exercises stands out. Coming amid growing tensions over Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the operation is being interpreted by some as sabre-rattling by Moscow. Certainly, it appears to send a pretty clear message from the Kremlin to Washington about what they consider to be meddling in their backyard. The visit is an important symbol of support to the communist-run government in Cuba and its socialist ally, Venezuela, where the warships may sail to next after they finish in Havana.

{"context": "In England there has been a stark warning that 40% of higher education institutions are predicting a deficit from the regulator.\n\n“There are several institutions that are teetering on the brink of going bust,” says Dr Gavan Conlon from London Economics.\n\nHe’s a leading expert in the economics of university education and this year has published research funded by the Nuffield Foundation to inform future government decisions.\n\nHe says no new government would allow a university to collapse because, as major employers, it would be “catastrophic for the local community” - which could mean finding many tens of millions of pounds of public money for an immediate bailout.\n\nDr Conlon also thinks increasing support for student living costs through existing loans or grants has to be looked at as part of thinking in the round about how to pay for university education.\n\nMany of the options are politically tricky, given the huge student protests that greeted the introduction of £9,000 fees in 2012.\n\nTuition fees in England are frozen at £9,250 for the next year. After that, whoever is in government will have to decide whether to increase them or give public money upfront to universities to support teaching costs.\n\nAnd remember, England has now loaded 84% of the total cost of studying for a degree onto future graduates, so it’s hard to shift the balance further.\n\nThe future bill to the public purse of writing off unpaid loans, called the RAB charge, is now estimated at only 4% in England.\n\nA future government might look at tweaking the interest rates to ensure higher, not lower-earning graduates pay a bigger share.\n\nOne other idea that has some support is that of a graduate levy for employers, who benefit from the additional skills in their workforce, which Dr Conlon says could generate “huge” amounts of money.\n\nIt’s not clear how that would work for big public sector employers like the NHS.\n\nThe number of international students could be allowed to grow further, but that brings greater uncertainty because of factors outside universities’ control.\n\nUltimately this is about political choices.\n\nThe money either has to come direct from government, from future graduates or from other forms of taxation such as the proposed graduate levy on employers.\n\nGiven the size of universities, their importance in some regions and the state of their finances, some decisions will have to be made in the next parliament.\n\nIt may be that universities are deemed too big to be allowed to fail, especially where they are a big part of their local economy.\n\nThe big expansion of the last decade also means more students, graduates and their families than ever before have a stake in their future.\n\nThe less academically selective universities take on the majority of students from poorer backgrounds, offering social mobility and the potential of higher earnings.\n\nIn the last decade, researchers have been linking big data of everyone taking GCSEs in England from 2002 onwards, with student and then tax records, giving an insight into the economic benefits of degrees.\n\nFor women graduates, compared with non-graduates, this data is unambiguous. Based on their earnings at 30, it pays to go to university. For men the difference is slightly smaller because of better-paid non-graduate work.\n\nOn average university pays, although not all benefit equally, and a not insignificant minority don’t gain financially and might do better just on this measure going through a technical or vocational route.\n\nThere has been a great social experiment playing out through the expansion of England’s universities, with no limit on student numbers.\n\nSo far only the Greens have called for tuition fees to be abolished. They also want to bring back maintenance grants and look in the longer term at reducing existing graduate debt.\n\nAs tuition fees are the major source of income for universities in England, that would have to be replaced with public money.\n\nLabour has confirmed it won’t scrap tuition fees and has said the funding model isn’t working.\n\nThe Lib Dems have promised to review higher education funding and to reinstate maintenance grants for disadvantaged students immediately.\n\nThe Conservative manifesto does not mention tuition fees directly, but it does say courses with the worst outcomes would be closed.\n\nIn its manifesto which it calls a contract, Reform says it would extend the repayment on the capital of student loans to 45 years, while scrapping interest.

{"context": "Dartitis: The condition where you try to throw a dart - but can't\n\nFormer professional darts champion Kevin Painter has thrown arrows almost every day for 40 years. Throughout his career he thrived under pressure, playing in the most prestigious competitions and taking home more than £900,000 in prize money. But earlier this year, he went to throw a dart and it physically would not leave his hand. \"You're in shock, I stood there for ages. I just couldn't get my arm up to let go of the dart,\" he said.\n\nKevin was suffering from dartitis, a mental condition where the brain stops a player from being able to release a dart. Finding a cure would become the 57-year-old's latest challenge. \"[Dartitis is] in the absence of any physical trauma, it's purely psychological,\" said Dr Linda Duffy, professor of psychology at Middlesex University. From 1982 to 1987 she was ranked women's world number one and also experienced dartitis. \"I used to combat it with extra practice. It was heard of back in the day, but not many people spoke about it,\" she said. Dartitis can affect all players, professional or amateur. Jack Langston, a darts referee and online content creator, was 12 when he first experienced the condition. \"There was a little pause just before I threw the dart,\" he said. It was barely noticeable at first but eventually it became so bad he would take 60 seconds to throw three darts. By the age of 13, he was forced to quit and at the time, considered his darts career to be over. \"You're turning up and getting beat by people you know you should be beating,\" he said. \"It's so demoralising. It's a real mental struggle.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Jack Langston has documented his experience with dartitis on social media\n\nEvery case is different, and there is no one single cause, but lots of players report it comes from a fear of missing. \"It's brought on by anxiety and stress,\" Kevin said. \"Where others have panic attacks, for me it manifested as dartitis.\" Dr Duffy says that - perhaps due to its name - players have a tendency to view dartitis as a problem unique to the sport which therefore demands unique solutions. \"It's just another cognitive disorder, so it should be treated that way,\" she says. \"The underlying mechanisms that cause dartitis are the same things that cause any other anxiety disorder.\" She recommends cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to enable the player to reframe dartitis as a challenge they need to overcome. Kevin has been trying to conquer the condition with hypnotherapy - and CBT - taking sessions with Chris O'Connor whose company Eccleston Park Hypnotherapy is the official \"hypnotherapy partner\" of the Professional Darts Players Association (PDPA). During his sessions, the patient lies on a sofa and is guided into a trance where they are th", "continuation": "en \"hit with all the confidence work and the motivation work\", Mr O'Connor said. \"It's all about getting them to visualise an area of their life they want to improve.\" After eight sessions, it seemed Kevin's dartitis had been cured for good. But two weeks later, during a televised match at the World Senior Darts tour, the condition returned. \"I was really, really disappointed,\" he said. \"I thought it had gone.\" He's now back working with Mr O'Connor on cracking the disorder long term.\n\nDr Linda Duffy was ranked women's world number one from 1982 to 1987\n\nThe therapy Mr O'Connor offers is tailored for each person he treats, using a mixture of Solution Focused Brief Therapy, hypnosis and visualization techniques to eliminate dartitis, he said. Mr O'Connor said: \"It's results-based, with clients often noticing changes after just a few sessions. \"I work with four world champions across UFC, darts, and snooker, and seven elite PDC darts players in the world top 30. So far, I have helped over 50 clients eliminate dartitis in the last two years.\" Unlike Kevin, Jack has managed to shake his dartitis and with lasting results. In January, the 31-year-old decided to start throwing with his left hand. \"[It was] the biggest decision of my entire life playing darts,\" he said. But it worked, and within three months he was winning matches at amateur tournaments. Alongside his better performances, Jack found another benefit - he no longer needed to drink alcohol to play. \"I used to shake if I didn't have a beer I'd be so nervous,\" he said. \"If you'd have told me a year ago I'd play darts sober, I wouldn't have believed you.\"\n\nJack Langston knew his dartitis would stop him from going professional\n\nIn another bid to aid his recovery, Kevin has also started to drink less. Despite there being no established link between drinking and dartitis, it's a sign of his determination to try everything to kick the condition. \"It's no secret everyone likes a drink when they play,\" he said. \"But you have to put the effort [into the treatment]. I like to go for a walk in the mornings to clear my head.\" \"Everyone's been very supportive,\" he said. \"I've spoken to so many people who have it or have had it. I wouldn't have had those conversations if I didn't get dartitis.\""}

{"context": "'Are we about to repeat history?': Martial law's traumatic legacy in South Korea\n\nEvents like 1980 - which ended with protesters like these being rounded up - have left a deep scar on South Korea\n\nKoh Jae-hak can still vividly remember when he saw policemen gunning down a group of young women in cold blood. It was April 1960. Students had launched protests calling for the resignation of the dictatorial president Syngman Rhee. Mr Koh was working in a government building when he looked out of the window and saw protesters clashing with police. \"There were demonstrations from various universities, and they all gathered in front… that's when shots were fired,\" the 87-year-old said. Days later, martial law was declared. South Korea is widely considered a peaceful beacon of democracy in Asia, but that wasn't always the case. This is a country that saw 16 bouts of martial law during its first four decades ruled largely by dictators. It is why democracy is now deeply treasured by South Koreans as a hard-won right. It is also why President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law this week – the first to happen in 45 years and during democratic rule - was particularly triggering and prompted such a visceral response. Almost immediately, lawmakers jumped out of bed and rushed to the national assembly, clambering over fences to reverse martial law. Hundreds of ordinary citizens gathered to hold back troops who had been ordered to throw out MPs. Some soldiers, apparently unwilling to carry out their orders, reportedly dragged their feet in clearing the crowd and entering the building.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. South Korea: How two hours of martial law unfolded\n\nWhen Yoon declared martial law on Tuesday night, he said it was necessary to get rid of \"pro-North anti-state\" forces. Initially, it caused confusion with some South Koreans who believed there was a genuine threat from the North. But as they continued watching Yoon's televised announcement, many grew sceptical. He gave no evidence of such forces at work, nor explained who they were. As Yoon had previously used similar language to describe the opposition that had been stymying his reforms, the public concluded he was actually trying to crush his political foes. Previous periods of martial law had also been justified by leaders as necessary to stabilise the country, and sometimes stamp out what they alleged were communist subversives planted by North Korea. They curtailed freedom of press and freedom of movement. Night curfews and arrests were common. Violent clashes sometimes took place, most indelibly in 1980, when then President Chun Doo-hwan extended martial law to deal with student protesters calling for democracy in the southern city of Gwangju. A brutal military crackdown was launched, and it has since been labelled a massacre – while the official death toll is 193, some experts believe hundreds more died.\n\nKoh Jae-hak (left) and Kang Hyo-san (right) remember when martial law was common in South Korea\n\nSouth Korea eventually transitioned to democracy in 1988, when the government held its first free and fair presidential election following mounting public pressure. But the preceding decades had permanently and profoundly shaped the nation's consciousness. \"Most Koreans have trauma, deep trauma, about martial law,\" said Kelly Kim, 53, an environmental activist. \"We don't want to repeat the same thing over and over.\" Ms Kim was a young child when martial law was last in place and has little memory of it. Still, she shudders at the thought of it returning. \"The government would control all the media, our normal activities. I'm working in civil society, so all our activities, like criticising the government, would not be possible under the martial law. So that's really horrible.\"\n\nThe freedoms afforded by democracy have not just led to a thriving civil society. In the more than 35 years since that first democratic election, South Korea's creative industries have flourished, with its dramas, TV shows, music and literature becoming world famous. Those creative industries have turned their own lenses onto the country's past, bringing history to life for those too young to remember. The country has seen a proliferation of shows about its dictatorship past, immortalising incidents such as the Gwangju uprising in popular culture. Some were blockbusters featuring South Korea's biggest stars, such as last year's 12.12 The Day, a historical drama starring popular actor Hwang Jung-min. The mov", "continuation": "ie depicts the political chaos that took place in 1979 as martial law was declared following the assassination of then president Park Chung-hee. \"As soon as I saw the images [of Yoon's declaration of martial law], it reminded me of that movie… it made me question, are we about to repeat that history now?\" said Marina Kang, a 37-year-old web designer. \"Korea's got a wealth of visual representational works [of that era] in films and documentaries. Though we only have indirect experience of the horrific past through these works… that still makes me feel very strongly that such events should not happen again.\"\n\nThere have been protests this week calling for Yoon to resign\n\nAmong younger citizens, there is a sense of disbelief that it could have returned. Despite never knowing life under martial law, they have been taught by their parents and older relatives to fear it. \"At first [when I heard Yoon's announcement], I was excited at the thought of getting a day off from school. But that joy was fleeting, and I was overwhelmed by the fear of daily life collapsing. I couldn't sleep,\" said 15-year-old Kwon Hoo. \"My father was concerned that under martial law, he wouldn't be able to stay out late even though his work required him to… when he heard the news about the possibility of a curfew being imposed again, he started swearing while watching the news.\" Not all South Koreans feel this way about their past. \"The vast majority of Koreans appreciate democracy enormously and regret the authoritarianism of the post-war period,\" said Mason Richey, associate professor of international politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul. But, he added, \"the country remains very divided regarding numerous aspects of the authoritarian past, notably how justified certain repressive measures were in order to prevent communist subversion.\"\n\nThere is the view among a significant portion of the population, especially among older folk, that martial law was necessary in the past for stability and democracy. \"Back then, it was a time defined by ideological warfare between democracy and communist socialism,\" said Kang Hyo-san, 83. He was sitting next to his friend Mr Koh in a cafe at Gwanghwamun, Seoul's main square and focal point for the city's protest rallies. The competing ideologies would lead to clashes and \"when the military intervened, the situation would stabilise… it was a process to restore order and properly establish free democracy. \"Given the circumstances, we couldn't help but view it positively,\" he said, adding that he felt each period of martial law left the country in a more \"favourable\" position. Martial law in South Korea \"fundamentally differed\" from other nations, where it \"wasn't about killing people or senseless violence\", he insisted. But this time, it's different. Both octogenarians felt that Yoon's declaration of martial law was unacceptable. \"Even though we've experienced martial law many times throughout our lives, this time there's no justification for its declaration,\" said Mr Koh. Like them, Ms Kim, the environmental activist, was glad Yoon did not succeed and democracy prevailed in the end. \"Because we fought so hard to get it, right? We don't want to lose it again. \"Without democracy and freedom of living, what is life?\""}
{"context": "Will using Western weapons on Russia help Ukraine change the war?\n\nUkraine is now allowed to use Western weapons to hit targets inside Russia. What will this decision change and how will it affect the front line in Ukraine? Up until now, Western countries restricted the use of their weapons to military targets located inside Ukraine, including Crimea and occupied territories. They were concerned that attacking targets across the internationally recognised border with weapons provided by Nato countries would escalate the conflict. But the latest Russian advance in the north-eastern Kharkiv region convinced Kyiv’s allies that in order to defend itself, Ukraine must be able to destroy military targets on the other side of the border as well. Last month, Russia launched a massive ground assault in the region, opening a new front and capturing several villages. The Russian advance posed a serious threat to Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, which is just 30km away from the border. The border in this region is effectively the front line as well, so the ban on using Western weapons to hit targets beyond Ukraine enabled Russian troops to prepare for that operation in a safe environment. Following the growing pressure from Ukraine and other European states, the US agreed to change its policy and allow Kyiv to strike Russia with Western weapons. “The hallmark of our engagement has been to adapt and adjust as necessary, to meet what’s actually going on on the battlefield, to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs, when it needs it,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Prague on Friday.\n\nMultiple residential areas were hit in Russia's latest wave on Kharkiv\n\nJust a few days before this announcement, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to expand “sanitary zones” in case Western long-range weapons are used to strike the Russian territory. He said that Nato countries in Europe must remember that they have “states with small territories and dense population”. “They must take this factor into consideration prior to discussing strikes deep inside the Russian territory,” he added. Avoiding an escalation is probably the reason why the US didn’t include long-range weapons such as ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) in its permission to strike Russia. These missiles have a range of 300km and could be used to hit military bases and airfields well into Russian territory. Such limitations leave Ukraine with only the option of focusing on targets near its border. But this is still a major policy shift by Kyiv’s main allies. Even with a shorter range - up to 70km - multiple rocket launchers such as HIMARS can significantly disrupt Russian logistics operations and troops movement, which will ultimately slow down any offensive plans. Now, Ukraine can “strike places where the enemy concentrated its troops, equipment and supply storage facilities that are used to attack Ukraine,” says Yuriy Povkh from the Kharkiv tactical group that co-ordinates military operations in the north-east. Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Russia was gathering its troops just 90km from Kharkiv for another offensive. And the Institute for Study of War analysed satellite images and confirmed that there were “expanded activities at depots and warehouses” in that area. So the ability to target those facilities will seriously strengthen the capacity of Ukrainian forces to repel new attacks in the region. Lifting the ban on Western weapons, however, is unlikely to help to protect Ukraine from Russian glide bombs known locally as KAB. They have a devastating effect and are regularly used to bomb Kharkiv and other border towns. But to stop such attacks, Ukrainian forces must target planes that drop those deadly KABs.\n\nUkraine received HIMARS as part of their international military assistance\n\nThe only weapon capable of intercepting those planes that Ukraine has at its disposal at this moment is the US air-defence system Patriot. However, getting this weapon close to Kharkiv is a huge risk. Spy drones can quickly spot it and Moscow can launch missiles such as Iskander to destroy this expensive system. Interestingly, the UK and France, which provide Ukraine with jointly made Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles (or Scalp as they are called in France), haven’t explicitly restricted their use. And their range can go up to 250km. In fact, French President Emanuel Macron told journalists last week:“We should allow [Ukraine] to neutralise the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked.” And such rhetoric is seen as permission to use Storm Shadows/Scalps, a military aviati", "continuation": "on officer who prefers to remain anonymous, told the BBC.

Ukrainian Su-24s that are equipped with these cruise missiles will have to get close to the Russian border in order to launch them, which makes them vulnerable to Russian air defence systems. F-16 jets that are expected by the end of this year are better equipped for such tasks. But President Zelensky admits that it’s still not clear whether Ukraine’s partners will allow these jets to be used to attack targets in Russia. “I think that using any weapon, Western kind of weapon, on the territory of Russia is a question of time,” he said at the Nordic summit in Stockholm on Friday. Ukrainian forces are trying to develop their own weapons to hit targets in Russia’s rear. Some of their drones have attacked oil depots and military facilities hundreds of kilometres away from the border. The latest attack was on a long-range radar station in the city of Orsk, which is 1800km from the Ukrainian border."}

At the pre-inquest hearing the family were told the court was short-staffed and had a backlog of 500 cases, which had built up over the pandemic.\n\nThey say they only discovered what drug their son had taken before he died, on 18 December 2020, after investigating his death with one of his friends - including examining photographs that showed the scene of Will's death.\n\nThey say a vital piece of evidence - the packet of blue pills found next to Will's body - was not tested until they raised it with the coroner's court a year after his death.\n\nTheir son's blood sample was destroyed after the company storing it went into administration, and by the time it came to the inquest, the family say they felt traumatised by the whole process.\n\n\"We thought the inquest system was there to give us answers,\" Mrs Melbourne says. \"Instead, we felt blocked at every turn. It was outrageous that we had to take the investigation on ourselves.\"\n\nThe parents of an autistic teenager follow his trail of evidence to uncover how he died.\n\nDescribed by those who knew him as a \"genius\", Will had been hoping to study mathematics at Cambridge. He was funny, passionate, and loved his friends and family, his parents say.\n\nHe was also autistic and battled with crippling social anxiety. Diagnosed at the age of eight, his parents say he received little support from any services.\n\nDiagnosed with autism at the age of eight, Will's family say he received little support\n\nThey say the world could be extremely challenging for Will, and by the time he was in his mid-teens, his anxiety had morphed into severe depression.\n\n\"He just wanted an escape from the pain,\" his mother explains. \"He was self-medicating with drugs.\"\n\nAccording to the Autism Research Centre, at the University of Cambridge, autistic people across the UK are far more likely to use recreational drugs to self-medicate for their mental health symptoms due to an absence of specific support in the NHS.\n\n\"This wasn't someone who's just trying to get high to have a good time,\" Mrs Melbourne says. \"It was an obsession with trying to make himself feel better.\"\n\nWill documented his struggles on YouTube in the months before his died\n\nIn just a few months, Will had been in and out of A&E nine times following suicide attempts and the police had been called more than 50 times.\n\nThe local authority, Cheshire East Council, had told the family their only option was to make their son homeless - and then they would find Will supported accommodation to help with his mental health issues.\n\nAt the time of his death, Will had been living in assisted accommodation for six months.\n\n\"It was like throwing out our sick child, but we felt we had no choice,\" his mother says. \"We couldn't get the support he needed and every day something more dangerous would happen. We also had to protect our daughter, Alice.\"\n\nWill's behaviour became so volatile he could no longer live with his family\n\nBy now, Will was ordering drugs from the dark web.\n\nOn 18 December 2020, he received what he believed to be oxycodone - a highly addictive opioid which not only helps with pain relief, but can also reduce the symptoms of anxiety.\n\n\"He could get so anxious he would be scared to leave the building.

His parents now know that the two blue pills he took, marked M30, were not oxycodone. They were metonitazene - a synthetic opioid hundreds of times stronger than morphine.\n\n\"The only reason we now know that is because we investigated,\" his father says, \"and Will helped us with that\".\n\nMetonitazene is part of the family of nitazenes, synthetic opioids recently linked to dozens of deaths across the UK.\n\nWill had kept a careful log of everything he took, how he consumed it, and at what time he had taken it. It was this log that helped his parents understand what he thought he had ordered and how much he had taken.\n\nWith the help of Will's best friend, Matt Beton, they were able to guess Will's password and access his computer where they found these detailed tables and lists.

Yet despite toxicology tests from Will's blood coming back negative for oxycodone, the blue pills were not tested.\n\nCheshire Police said it is not \"common practice\" to test all drugs found at the scene of sudden deaths.\n\nThey added that because Will's death was not suspicious, a standard post-mortem and toxicology report was requested by the coroner and no further tests were requested.\n\nCoroner Victoria Davies agreed with the evidence gathered by Will's family, that the blue pills were metonitazene and that Will had bought them believing them to be oxycodone.\n\nWill kept a detailed log of the drugs he had taken on his computer\n\nThe court heard the drug would have been so potent it would have caused respiratory depression - preventing Will's lungs from taking in enough oxygen - and he would have died within an hour.\n\nThe inquest verdict was death by misadventure.\n\nCheshire East Council said it supported the coroner's findings and it remains \"committed to providing the highest standards of care\" and will continue to \"identify opportunities to improve services\".\n\nRichmond Fellowship, which ran the assisted accommodation in Macclesfield, said the \"health, safety and wellbeing of the people we support have always been at the heart of everything we do\" and that it would continue to review and improve its services.\n\n\"Our son is now part of a wider picture about synthetic opioids,\" Will's mother says. \"Maybe if they had tested the drugs as a matter of course, the warning bells about this drug could have been sounded sooner.\"\n\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by mental health issues, please visit BBC Action Line to find information on organisations that can help.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."}

Speaking at the gala performance of The Devil Wears Prada: The Musical he said: \"I have lost my sight and I haven't been able to see the performance but I have enjoyed listening to it.\" The West End show hosted a charity gala for the Elton John AIDS Foundation on Sunday evening. The star-studded event attracted a host of famous faces including Anna Wintour, Lily Collins and Donatella Versace.\n\nThe 77-year-old pop star has been struggling with his eyesight since getting an infection in his right eye in July. While his exact condition is unclear, Sir Elton told ABC News' Good Morning America in November that he developed the infection in the south of France. \"It's been four months now since I haven't been able to see, and my left eye is not the greatest,\" he said at the time.

{"context": "Officers who have worked at the event over the last 10 years described it as \"hell\" and a \"warzone\"\n\nA majority of police officers feel unsafe working at Notting Hill Carnival, a survey by the Metropolitan Police Federation has suggested. As part of the survey, officers who have worked at the event over the last 10 years described it as \"hell\" and a \"warzone\". There were more than 350 violent or sexual offences reported at the carnival in August, including the fatal stabbing of young mother Cher Maximen, according to the Met Police, and 61 attacks on officers. However, the carnival's organiser said the survey had an \"an anti-carnival agenda\" and only represented the views of a minority of the 7,000 officers who work at the event.\n\nNotting Hill Carnival Ltd said the survey was \"hugely flawed\" as it returned the views of \"at best just 7% o", "continuation": "f potential officers on duty\". In a survey of 486 officers, 89% said they did not feel safe and 29% said they had been assaulted while policing the event. The federation, which represents rank and file officers, said the poll aimed to get \"concrete evidence\" of the experience of officers. The carnival - a celebration of Caribbean culture - takes place along a three-and-a-half mile (5.6km) route in north Kensington, west London, and has been running for more than 50 years.\n\nHeld over each August bank holiday, the display of costumes, dancing and music attracts about two million revellers. The running of the event has been criticised in recent years over what police call \"an unacceptable level of crime\", but some supporters of the carnival claim it has been unfairly portrayed. One unnamed officer said it was \"dangerous\", with officers being treated as \"lambs to slaughter\", while another said they would \"would rather crawl naked through broken glass\" than work there.\n\nAbout two million people attend the carnival each August bank holiday, to see spectacular displays of dance and costumes\n\nSimon Hill, deputy general secretary of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: \"I'm actually quite shocked by some of the responses. I knew that the event wasn't popular, for a whole variety of reasons. \"But the candour from the officers and some of their descriptions of how they feel, how they felt at the carnival and their experiences of being assaulted, quite frankly were shocking.\" The federation is also concerned the large scale of the event meant officers felt \"powerless\" to prevent those attending the event becoming victims of crime, Mr Hill said. \"No other event in London has this combination or level of issues for officers.\" He said officers' concerns about long working hours also emerged from the survey.\n\nThe event organiser said it condemned \"all acts of violence\" and said the results of the survey were \"misleading\". \"It is quite clearly written with an anti-carnival agenda that the police federation highlights every year. It is driven by unsubstantiated quotes and little solid data, designed to create negative headlines,\" Notting Hill Carnival Ltd said. A spokesperson added that organisers rely on the collaboration with police and local authorities, but \"this continued rhetoric unquestionably has a detrimental effect on the events planning process\". The Metropolitan Police's Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward said: \"The views described in the survey reflect many of the long-standing concerns about crowd safety and crime at Notting Hill Carnival. \"They also highlight recent positive changes to officer provision which we know we need to continue to build on.\" He said the force was concerned by \"unacceptable levels of crime at the event\" and that \"step change\" was needed in the running of the event to prevent overcrowding."}
{"context": "US avoids government shutdown after days of political turmoil\n\nDemocratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer gives a thumbs up walking out of the Senate Chamber\n\nThe US government has enacted a budget to avert shutting itself down, but the bitterly disputed deal doesn't include a call from President-elect Donald Trump to increase the federal borrowing limit. US President Joe Biden signed the spending bill into law on Saturday morning. The Senate passed the agreement shortly after a midnight deadline by 85-11. The House of Representatives approved it hours earlier by 336-34. Without a funding deal, millions of federal employees would have ended up either on temporary unpaid leave or working without pay. US government debt stands at about $36 trillion (£29tn), with more money now being spent just on the interest payments than on US national security.\n\nA shutdown would have closed or severely reduced operations for public services like parks, food assistance programmes and federally-funded preschools, while limiting assistance to aid-reliant farmers and people recovering from natural disasters. Lawmakers earlier this week successfully negotiated a deal to fund government agencies, but it fell apart after Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk called on Republicans to reject it. The last government shutdown was during Trump's first presidential term in 2019 and lasted 35 days - the longest in US history. The American Relief Act, 2025 that just passed is 118 pages, stripped down from a 1,547-page bill that Trump and Musk rejected this week. It will fund the US government at current levels until 14 March. Trump's call to lift the debt ceiling - which was a sticking point for Democrats and some Republican budget hawks - was not included in the final bill, but Republican leaders said that measure would be debated in the new year. The dramatic budget fight is a preview of the legislative fights that may lie in store when Trump takes office next month. \"Trying to jam a debt ceiling suspension into the legislation at the 11th hour was not sustainable,\" House Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said ahead of the vote. He later praised the bill's passage, saying: \"House Democrats have successfully stopped the billionaire boys club.\"\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson spoke to the media after the House passed the bill\n\nThe deal removes measures sought by Democrats in the first version of the bill, including the first pay rise for lawmakers since 2009, healthcare reforms, and provisions aimed at preventing hotels and live event venues from deceptive advertising. It does include $100bn in disaster relief funds to help with hurricane recovery and other natural disasters, and allocates $10bn in aid to farmers. It also includes full federal funding to rebuild Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed when it was struck by a cargo ship in March. Musk, who Trump has tasked with cutting government s", "continuation": "pending in his administration, had lobbied heavily against the earlier version of the bill. During the debate, Republicans said they looked forward to a \"new era\" with Trump taking office on 20 January and Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress. Currently, the Senate remains under Democratic control. The budget wrangling left Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson bruised as he faced criticism from members of his own party, raising a question mark over whether he can win a 3 January vote in the chamber to keep his job. \"We are grateful that everyone stood together to do the right thing and having gotten this done now as the last order of business for the year, we are set up for a big and important new start in January,\" Johnson told reporters after Friday's vote. He also said that he had spoken frequently to both Trump and Musk during the negotiations. Musk praised the Louisiana congressman's work on the budget in a post on X, the social media platform he owns. \"The Speaker did a good job here, given the circumstances,\" he posted. \"It went from a bill that weighed pounds to a bill that weighed ounces.\""}

Fans of the TV medic, who pioneered the 5:2 diet and highlighted the benefits of intermittent fasting, have been contacting BBC News with their thoughts.\n\nPilates teacher Gillian Burn, from Hampshire, said: \"Over the last few years, I have incorporated Michael's amazing health messages in a fun way into my classes, including the value of regular squatting, balancing on one leg and breathing exercises. \"We were not so keen on taking cold showers, though do advocate power naps, eating dark chocolate and green tea! \"We are committed to keeping his legacy going during our exercise classes and will continue to promote healthy living in everything we do. \"His messages have brought us many laughs and smiles.\" She added that during her most recent class - on Monday morning - each exercise was \"a tribute to the amazing Michael Mosley\".\n\nPilates instructor Gillian Burn said Dr Mosley's messages brought her group \"many laughs and smiles\"\n\nJennifer Clark, from Wagga Wagga, Australia, said the TV presenter had become \"a fixture\" in her life. \"Dr Mosley was passionate, vulnerable and always brought a smile.

A further 202 were victims of extra-judicial killings between 1968 and 1985.\n\nHuman rights NGO Observatorio Luz Ibarburu and Francesca Lessa, an academic at University College London, have spent years collecting data on the crimes committed during Uruguay's 12-year dictatorship and followed attempts to bring those responsible to justice.\n\nUruguay returned to democracy in 1985, but an immunity law granting amnesties to members of the armed forces accused of human rights violations was in force until 2011.\n\nMontevideo's Museum of Memory is dedicated to victims of the dictatorship\n\nTo date, only 28 people have been convicted of dictatorship-era abuses.\n\nPablo Chargoñia of Observatorio Luz Ibarburu says that the proposed legislation could lead to the few officers that have been convicted being sent home.\n\nTime is also against those trying to investigate the dictatorship-era crimes. The coup that ushered in the military regime took place 50 years ago and many of those involved died before they could be prosecuted, explains Mr Chargoñia.\n\nBesides trying to prosecute perpetrators, rights groups are trying to find out what happened to the \"disappeared\", people who were kidnapped by the military regime.\n\nThey have called on the Uruguayan armed forces to release information about their whereabouts. But so far, of the 197 Uruguayans who were forcibly disappeared, the remains of only 31 have been found.\n\nThe search is complicated by the fact that many were victims of a secret plan called Operation Condor, in which the dictatorships of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay worked together to track down their opponents across borders.\n\nTwenty-five of the 31 bodies were found in Argentina, showing the extent to which the two neighbouring countries' dictatorships collaborated.\n\nWhile most of those disappeared by the military decades ago are presumed dead, survivors of Operation Condor have been able to provide information about how the military regimes operated.\n\nSara Méndez is one of them. In the 1970s, the Uruguayan left-wing activist and teacher was living in exile in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires.\n\nSara Méndez lived in Argentina when she was arrested by the military regime there\n\nOn 13 July 1976, she was kidnapped in a joint operation by the Uruguayan and Argentine armed forces. As armed men hustled her blindfolded into a car, they left her three-week old baby behind, sleeping in a wicker basket.\n\nSara was taken to a secret torture house in Buenos Aires, before being sent back to Uruguay where she was imprisoned for five years.\n\nShe spent the next 25 years searching for her son, Aníbal Mendez, before finally finding him in 2002 in Argentina. Aníbal had been adopted by a police commander in Buenos Aires and knew nothing of this sinister past.\n\nWhen Aníbal was 25 years old, the man he thought was his father told him he was adopted: \"He said that a baby had been abandoned at a local clinic. His wife thought the baby was so beautiful, they decided to adopt him.\"\n\n\"I listened to his version, but I didn't believe it,\" the now-47-year-old Aníbal says.\n\nAníbal agreed to take a DNA test, which confirmed he was Sara's son. He and Sara have spent the last 20 years building a relationship.\n\n\"At the beginning it was very difficult. Imagine, a person that didn't raise you, that you've only just met, but you know she is your biological mother, this was something we had to overcome,\" he explains.\n\nSara Méndez was able to find her son and is now a grandmother to his baby\n\nAníbal has also had to grapple with his conflicting feelings for the couple who raised him: \"I am very clear that these two people who brought me up committed this terrible crime of taking a baby and changing its identity. But I grew up with their love and I am not going to erase this love they gave me or the love I also felt for them.\"\n\nSara says that reconnecting with her son \"took many years of work\".\n\nOf the estimated 500 babies taken in Argentina from women political detainees like Sara during the dictatorship, 133 children have been reunited with their birth families.\n\nBut the baby thefts have left a legacy of complex trauma.\n\n'I think that the stealing of babies was one of the cruellest things these dictatorships did - the taking of a child by people who formed part of a repressive apparatus that persecuted, tortured and killed their parents,\" Sara says.\n\nShe is concerned that the proposed law currently winding its way through Congress \"doesn't distinguish between common crimes and crimes committed by the state\".\n\nShe also thinks the bill \"does not consider the victim's opinion when it comes to deciding any modification of the prison regime for convicted officers\".\n\nThree retired military officers and one policeman are currently serving sentences in Uruguay in connection with the kidnap and torture of Sara Méndez.\n\nOne of them has already been released into house arrest. If this bill is passed the others could also serve out their sentences at home."}

He was suffering from depression and nightmares. “I was thinking that it’s peaceful in here,” he said eventually, breaking the silence. “There’s a man in the room next to mine who keeps shouting in the night.”\n\nIt took him months to open up about his recurring nightmare. In it, he was strangling a young man who morphed into his father. It led us to discuss his offences and his family and how, as a child, Tony had suffered violent abuse at the hands of his father; in turn, he began to bully others.\n\nLater I learnt that the man “in the next room” who shouted at night was Tony himself. I suggested that perhaps he was shouting the things that he could not express. He dropped his face in his hands, muffling his voice. “No… I don’t want to,” he admitted. “I can’t be so weak.”\n\nI worked with Tony for 18 months and came to feel compassion and respect for his honesty, even as I still held in mind the terrible trail of destruction he had caused. The fact he’d requested this therapy himself was also a sign that part of him was ready to be vulnerable.\n\nThat early experience taught me that no matter their history, if people – including serial killers – are able to be curious about their minds, there’s a chance that we can make meaning out of disorder."}

His wife later reported Dr Mosley, who did not have his phone, missing. BBC News has seen new CCTV - one of the last-known sightings - of a man believed to be Dr Mosley walking with an umbrella next to the marina in the village of Pedi on Wednesday, heading towards rocky hills. The new footage, recorded at about 14:00 local time (12:00 BST), appears to show the man walking steadily and unaided, an unnamed police officer told BBC News. Greek authorities have since shifted their search operation to this part of the island. In the mountainous terrain it would be easy to fall and injure yourself, or wander off the trail and get lost. One theory that has emerged is that Dr Mosley was trying to take a much longer route than previously thought, passing over miles of exposed hillside. His accommodation was in the main town about 1 mile (1.6 km) from Pedi. When BBC News walked a short bit of the same path Dr Mosley is believed to have followed, under the midday sun, the effects of the heat could be felt quickly.\n\nA photo of Dr Mosley on holiday in Symi was shared on a local Facebook group on Wednesday\n\nSo far, police and firefighters have been using drones, a helicopter and a sniffer dog to try to locate the missing presenter.

Mr Papakaloudoukas added he was unsure why the missing presenter would try to make a long, potentially arduous journey in such heat, but hopes he is found \"safe and alive\".\n\nBefore moving into TV, Dr Mosley studied medicine in London and qualified as a doctor but for the last couple of decades has been working as a presenter, documentary maker, journalist and author.

Gilly, a 33-year-old admin worker, told BBC News what followed was the most stressful period of her life. \"It was torture,\" she said. \"We were struggling to pay the rent anyway because our bills were £400 a month, so this extra £300 was just not doable.\" Unable to afford the hike, Gilly and her flatmate moved out in the hope of finding cheaper flats separately. \"I had no idea what the market was like,\" Gilly said. \"I was pretty much applying for or trying to get a booking for every single flat I could find. \"Most of them didn’t even get back to me and the ones that did said there’s no more bookings available, and this was within an hour or two of the advert going up.\"\n\nGilly Ramage and her flatmate were told their rent would increase by £300 a month\n\nThe Scottish government's most recent housing market review showed that rents in Glasgow increased by more than 22% in the year to September - almost double the national average. Gilly eventually found a one-bedroom flat for £650 a month – still an increase of £100 on what she was paying before. She said it was not somewhere she would have chosen to live “if given the choice”. She said she never imagined being in such an uncertain living situation at this stage in her life. “When you’re younger and you think about your thirties, you assume you’ll have your life put together,\" Gilly said. “I work full-time, I feel like I should be able to live by myself and live quite comfortably. It’s just a constant struggle.”\n\nHer situation is not unique – tenants’ rights union Living Rent told BBC News they had seen a 300% increase in the number of people contacting them about rent increases since April. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) also show that average rents in Scotland have increased more rapidly than in England or Wales, despite Scotland being the only UK nation to have introduced rent controls. Average rents increased by 10% in Scotland, 8.9% in England and 8.2% in Wales in the 12 months up to April 2024. When the rent cap in Scotland ended, a system came into force which allows tenants to challenge a rent increase by taking it to an adjudication service. This has the power to restrict increases to 12% but it is not illegal for a landlord to request a higher rent.\n\nChristina Laird and her flatmate have had notice of a 33% rent increase\n\nChristina Laird and her flatmate are about to undergo this process themselves after receiving notice of a 33% rent increase for their flat in Edinburgh. \"It’s not a case of having a choice, we just wouldn’t be able to afford it,\" the 27-year-old charity worker told BBC News. \"We aren’t on huge wages, we both work for charities, so we’d have to completely change our lifestyles. \"We’d have to make a decision to move much further out of the city which would be difficult with work, and we’d have to rely more on public transport so that’s another financial increase.” Christina said that in order to afford the increase, she would have to “dramatically” reduce how often she visits her family and socialises outside of work. \"I don’t live a luxury lifestyle, I don’t travel a lot, I don’t splurge – it would be a case of cutting back my life to a point where it’s quite bare,\" she said. Christina said they were hoping they could negotiate a 12% increase, although it would still have a “massive impact” on their daily lives and finances. \"The thing that’s upset me the most is this has really emphasised the power imbalance in the renting market,\" she said. \"I can’t afford to save because I’m paying someone else’s mortgage.\"\n\nLiving Rent are urging people to challenge any increases but they said many tenants had found the adjudication system “complicated and confusing”. “Some of them have even received eviction notices after raising their rent increase with the adjudication process,” said campaigns chair Ruth Gilbert. “And some tenants are choosing to leave their flats rather than go through the stress of the rent adjudication service, and for those that do, a 12% increase is having a huge impact on their ability to live.” Ms Gilbert said Scotland “desperately” needs a permanent system of rent controls. Landlords say rising mortgage rates and increasing bills for repairs have often resulted in rents not recovering their costs. \"The only effect of these short-term, poorly thought-through measures has been to vilify landlords, reduce investment, reduce supply and increase costs for tenants and landlords, causing significant harm,” said John Blackwood, chief executive of the Scottish Association of Landlords. \"The sector has long seen the consequences of a lack of appropriate social housing in Scotland that forces people into rented accommodation which might not be suitable for their needs.”\n\nScottish ministers have come under heavy scrutiny from both housing providers and campaigners for cutting the affordable housing budget by £163m overall, or 22%, in real terms for 2023-24. Mr Blackwood said the Scottish government must “work with all partners” to put together a plan that “encourages investment across all parts of Scotland’s housing sector” and increases construction of social and owner-occupied homes. In its Hou", "continuation": "sing Bill published earlier this year, the Scottish government set out its intention to introduce a form of long-term rent controls – but the bill is still to be scrutinised at Holyrood and it will not come into effect until at least 2026. After sustained pressure from campaigners and opposition parties, the Scottish government also declared a national housing emergency in May amid record open homeless cases and spiralling private rent costs. However, this declaration places no obligation on Scottish ministers to take any specific actions to address the emergency. Several local authorities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, had already declared housing emergencies of their own. Housing Minister Paul McLennan said a fairer, well-managed private rented sector was in the interest of both tenants and responsible landlords. He said: \"Our Housing Bill includes a package of important reforms to the rented sector that aim to improve affordability and strengthen tenants’ rights, including the introduction of long term rent control.\""}

Field Marshal is the highest rank in the British Army. King Charles was promoted to the rank while Queen Elizabeth II was alive, but as monarch he is the head of the entire armed forces.

She said that 80 years on, the \"same spirit and those same qualities remain much in evidence throughout our Armed Forces\", who \"undertake your duties in the face of a multitude of challenges and dangers\". The Queen added: \"In so doing, you not only protect these Isles, but also defend liberties way beyond these shores. \"Your determination, unrelenting efforts and selfless loyalty to each other and to the United Kingdom are as enduring as our gratitude.\" The patron of the British Forces Broadcasting Service charity, which produced the video, also thanked the families of servicemen and women \"who keep the home fires burning\" while their loved ones are overseas. Noting her father, Major Bruce Shand, and his own role in North Africa and Dunkirk in World War Two - the latter of which earned him the Military Cross - the Queen said: \"As the proud daughter of an Army officer, I know something of the impact military life has on your loved ones.

Nika Gvaramia, 48, a leader from one of four opposition groups, was carried by his arms and legs by police from his party HQ in a side street next to parliament in the capital Tbilisi. Other leaders were later ambushed after they met at a hotel and decided to push for a general strike. Nightly demonstrations have been held since last Thursday, after ruling party Georgian Dream said it was halting the country's bid to start talks on joining the EU.\n\nMore than 330 protesters have been arrested and rights groups say many have been beaten in detention, however authorities started going after opposition leaders after a strident briefing from Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze. \"Politicians who organised violence but hid in offices will not be able to evade responsibility for the events that have unfolded over the past days,\" he warned, accusing protesters of spreading \"liberal fascism\". Protests had initially erupted late in October after a contested election that monitoring groups said was marred by a string of violations. But they burst into life last Thursday when Kobakhidze's increasingly authoritarian Georgian Dream party said it was suspending the country's bid to start talks on joining the EU. Two days later, the US suspended Georgia's long-sought strategic partnership. Georgian Dream has enacted increasingly authoritarian laws targeting civil society and LGBT groups as well as freedom of speech, and opposition parties accuse the party of moving Georgia back into the sphere of influence of neighbour Russia.\n\nPrime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze vowed action would be taken against protest organisers\n\nGeorgia's interior ministry says more than 100 officers have been hurt by fireworks, rocks and other projectiles, but the country's ombudsman for human rights has accused the police of exercising brutality and torture toward protesters. In the early hours of Monday, Nika Gvaramia who is one of the leaders of Coalition for Change, told the BBC that the protesters had no other option but to take to the streets, because the alternative was the elimination of their country, \"not just in Russia’s zone of influence but some kind of puppet territory\". He also predicted that his party HQ would soon be raided by Georgia's authorities, and that took place less than 36 hours later. Other opposition leaders met for an hour during the evening in a hotel in Tbilisi's central Liberty Square, and decided to step up co-operation and push for a general strike in the wider general public. \"It's a total campaign of terror against free speech, against freedom of opinion, against democracy,\" Levan Tsutskiridze of Str", "continuation": "ong Georgia told the BBC. Another leader of Coalition for Change, Zurab Girchi Japaridze, said it was not a pleasant feeling, realising that more arrests could come: \"You think you're prepared for this but you never are.\" As they left the meeting, some leaders came under attack in Liberty Square and two were seen being detained by waiting police, including opposition figure and world champion wrestler Zurabi Datunashvili. In all, the opposition said 11 members had been arrested, including a Strong Georgia leader Aleko Elisashvili and two colleagues. The United National Movement said five members from its youth office had been taken away too. Authorities also raided the home of an activist from Daitove, a large anti-government Facebook group that helps detained protesters, and then moved to the home of its co-founder Nancy Woland. They also targeted activists from other movements.\n\nNika Gvaramia predicted his party HQ would be raided when he spoke to the BBC\n\nGvaramia was taken initially to a detention centre of the outskirts of Tbilisi where many of the 300 detained protesters have been held, and then on to another detention centre in Marneuli, south of the capital, reports say. The former head of an opposition TV channel, Gvaramia spent 13 months in jail for abuse of authority, but he was pardoned in June 2023 by pro-Western President Salome Zourabichvili. Amnesty International said at the time the charges against him were groundless and politically motivated.\n\nThe protests have continued for seven nights in Tbilisi and in other towns and cities\n\nGeorgian Dream has been stung by a series of resignations, including ambassadors to the US, Czech Republic, the Netherlands and other countries. The deputy foreign minister has also stepped down, but so far they have steered clear of speaking publicly. Tea Maisuradze posted on X that it had been honour to serve Georgia's interests, \"fostering European and Euro-Atlantic integration\" and she made clear she remained committed to Georgia's future as part of the European Union. Late on Wednesday night, Irakli Shaishmelashvili, who headed a unit in the interior ministry's special tasks department, and was therefore heavily involved in forcing the dispersal of protests, stepped down from his job citing family reasons. The only other reason he gave came from two emojis - a Georgian and an EU flag."}
{"context": "Immigration detention is only lawful if a flight is a realistic and imminent prospect\n\nLawyers representing asylum seekers who were detained to be sent to Rwanda say 79 of their clients have now been released on bail. Scores of asylum seekers were taken into detention from late April, after Rishi Sunak said that flights would leave in the first weeks of July. The confirmation of the bailing of dozens of the detainees comes after government lawyers told the High Court that there would be no flight before 24 July at the earliest. The Home Office has never confirmed the numbers held in detention and said it would not provide a running commentary on the Rwanda operation. Prime Minister Mr Sunak says that if he is returned to power there will be a regular rhythm of flights, starting in July. Labour has pledged to scrap the policy if it wins the general election on 4 July.\n\nImmigration Removal Centres are used to hold people before they are to be transported out of the UK\n\nThe Liberal Democrats and SNP also say that the scheme should be scrapped because it breaks international law. The impending general election is not a formal legal test for release from detention - but judges assess in each case whether a flight is reasonably foreseeable. In a statement on social media platform X, Duncan Lewis Solicitors said: “We represent 50 of those detainees and can confirm that they all now have bail. “Many clients are survivors of torture and trafficking. The tribunal, in granting bail, rightly assessed them to not carry a risk of absconding, reaching the rational view that removal was not imminent.\" The solicitors said that the detrimental impact \"unnecessary and prolonged\" detention has had on its clients is \"yet to be fully assessed.\" “The extent to which taxpayers' money has been wasted by detaining people in this way, around the time of the local elections for what appears to be for political gain, when removal was not imminent, needs to be calculated”, the company added.\n\nA second law firm, Wilsons, has told BBC News that all 15 of its clients, who had been similarly detained under “Operation Vector” - the Home Office’s plan to prepare for Rwanda flights - have also been released. Bail for Immigration Detainees, a legal charity, says that all 14 of its clients have been either bailed by courts or were released by the Home Office to return to accommodation.

Although the future of the policy is uncertain, the courts must work on the basis that flights could take off, until a minister tells them otherwise."}

{"context": "Carlos Corberan won 47 of his 107 games in charge of West Bromwich Albion\n\nLa Liga strugglers Valencia have appointed West Bromwich Albion boss Carlos Corberan as their new head coach. Valencia paid a release clause, believed to be between £3-4m, in the 41-year-old Spaniard's contract to allow him to leave Championship club Albion. Corberan has signed a deal until the end of the 2026-27 season with the Spanish club, who sacked head coach Ruben Baraja on Monday after just two wins in 17 league matches this season. In a statement,, external Albion said Corberan was leaving \"with the club's gratitude and best wishes\". Coaches Chris Brunt, Damia Abella and Boaz Myhill will take caretaker charge of the Baggies while they search for a new coach.\n\nFollowing confirmation of his appointment by Valencia, Corberan said on social media that the decision to leave Albion had been \"the hardest of my life\". \"There will always be a place in my heart for this special club and I hope one day I can return to thank you all for your incredible support,\" he said.\n\nFormer Huddersfield Town boss Corberan was appointed by the Baggies in October 2022, leading them to a ninth-placed finish in his first season and fifth last term, as they lost to Southampton in the play-off semi-finals. He has ", "continuation": "guided Albion to seventh place in the Championship table this season, just outside the play-off places on goals scored, despite claiming his playing budget had been reduced by 30%. Corberan had been linked with the recent managerial vacancy at Premier League side Southampton, but Saints chose Ivan Juric to replace the sacked Russell Martin. Valencia, Corberan's hometown club, are four points from safety, sitting second-bottom of La Liga. In Baraja's final game as manager, they drew 2-2 with Alaves on Sunday to move off the bottom of the table on goal difference. They face reigning champions Real Madrid in their next league game on 3 January.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion left it late to deliver their Christmas Eve bombshell that Carlos Corberan was leaving to take over at Valencia. Santa Claus was well into his round when the announcement came at just 20 minutes to midnight. But where does it now leave the club? And their now former head coach. Going back to Spain to manage Valencia may prove to be a risk for 41-year-old Corberan. Just ask one of his predecessors in the job, Gary Neville! The men from the Mestalla are in the relegation zone, have had financial difficulties and, since current Aston Villa boss Unai Emery left in 2012, only one manager has lasted longer than two years in charge. But then there's Albion's own financial situation. Corberan's hands have been tied for most of his 26-month reign. He was appointed as Steve Bruce's successor in October 2022 when chairman Guochuan Lai was still officially at the helm, but in name only, with presence and financial support completely non-existent. Yet Corberan organised a team who went from the relegation zone to just missing out on a 2022-23 Championship play-off place. The following season, he did achieve a place in the top six, losing in the semis to Southampton, with whom he was also linked last week - again without a single penny for his recruitment team to spend. But his coaching qualities came to the fore as he turned cast-offs such as Cedric Kipre and Alex Mowatt into vital members of his starting XI, which he has done again this season with Karlan Grant. Despite American businessman Shilen Patel's February takeover, the club's financial restrictions remain ongoing. Only last week it was revealed that the decreased wage budget back in the summer was actually as much as 30%, forcing the loss of several players. For the Baggies, it's a blow in the short term – particularly the timing of it with three games to come in six days over the festive period. But it may be a move that suits all parties. Corberan gets to finally test himself in the top flight of an elite league, he gets a move close to his family and that vocal minority of Albion fans who've become tired of his football will get to see something different. However, that comes with a side warning of 'be careful what you wish for' because the job he has done in stabilising the club on the field during a period of utter turmoil cannot be understated and they're definitely in a better place compared with two years ago. He should leave with the well wishes of the majority of Baggies supporters - and definitely will with those he worked with at the training ground because, as well as being a top coach, most importantly, he is a decent man."}

The 47-year-old beat JLS singer JB Gill, actress Sarah Hadland and former Love Islander Tasha Ghouri to lift the glitterball trophy in Saturday's live final on BBC One. McCausland, who was the bookmakers' favourite to win, performed three dances with partner Dianne Buswell. He said his win was for her, \"and for everyone out there who's got told they couldn't do something or thought they couldn't do it\".\n\n\"It just shows with opportunity and support and determination, anything can happen,\" he added. As usual, one of the dances in the grand finale was chosen by the judges, one was their own favourite dance from the series, and the other was a show dance. The judges gave advisory scores but the public made the final decision.\n\nThe finalists of Strictly Come Dancing 2024\n\nMcCausland and Buswell performed routines including their waltz to You'll Never Walk Alone by Gerry and the Pacemakers in the grand final. The pair also reprised their couple's choice routine to Instant Karma by John Lennon. When they first performed it last month, it went viral on social media thanks to a \"blackout moment\", designed to imitate McCausland's experience with blindness. They repeated the moment in the grand final, impressing the judges and getting them a score of 38. \"Chris, I am a mess because of you, and I said I would not cry in this final,\" said judge Motsi Mabuse, as she wiped away tears. McCausland was registered blind after gradually losing his sight to retinitis pigmentosa in his 20s and 30s.\n\nChris McCausland and Dianne Buswell performed three dances on the night\n\nThe winning duo faced stiff competition from the other remaining couples - JB Gill and Lauren Oakley, Tasha Ghouri and Aljaž Škorjanec, and Sarah Hadland and Vito Coppola. Gill and Oakley were first to take to the dance floor. The pair performed routines including a Show Dance to a Motown Medley and a Viennese Waltz to Let's Go Fly A Kite from Mary Poppins. The latter received the first top marks of the night, with straight 10s awarded by the judges. It came after the singer's original dance partner, Amy Dowden, was forced to pull out of the series last month due to a foot injury.\n\nJB Gill danced with Lauren Oakley, after his previous partner pulled out with an injury\n\nNext up, it was time for Ghouri and Škorjanec, who reprised their American Smooth routine to Someone You Loved by Lewis Capaldi. They also performed a show dance to Sing, Sing, Sing by Benny Goodman. Ghouri is Strictly's second deaf contestant, three years after Rose Ayling-Ellis won the contest. There was also a poignant moment when her brother surprised her, having just landed back from Australia. \"Can't describe it,\" he said, as they hugged. \"Follow your dreams. You're so special.\"\n\nFinally, Hadland and Coppola performed routines including a Cha Cha to Like A Prayer by Madonna. They also did an American Smooth, scoring them 39 out of 40 - despite Coppola suffering a wardrobe malfunction. Gill and Ghouri topped the final leaderboard, with 119 points each - followed by Hadland with 118, and McCausland at 116. But after weeks of tangos, salsas and foxtrots, it was McCausland and Buswell's night as they topped the public vote. A charity has praised McCausland's win, saying it will \"lead to many more disabled people being included in the biggest TV shows\". Steven Morris, who is deafblind and the campaigns officer for the disability charity Sense, said: \"Chris's historic Strictly Come Dancing win goes to show that given opportunities and support, disabled people can break down barriers many wrongly don't think are possible.\" He added: \"This is an important moment for representation.\"\n\nOther highlights on the night included a spectacular dance number, where the Strictly professionals were joined by Worth It singer Raye. The entire line-up of 2024 also came back for one more routine. There have been plenty of twists and turns in the show's 20th anniversary year. Highlights included Bollywood music coming to the ballroom, when contestant Punam Krishan and her partner Gorka Márquez danced to Bole Chudiyan from 2001 hit film Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. It was the first time in the show's history that a competing couple have performed to a traditional Bollywood song.\n\nThere was also controversy when dancer Katya Jones appeared to move her partner Wynne Evans's hand from her waist. She later said it was \"nonsense\" that the moment made her feel uncomfortable in any way. It came after a difficult summer for the show, with a number of former celebrity contestants speaking up about their negative experiences on Strictly.

EastEnders actor Jamie Borthwick, Eighties popstar Toyah Willcox and singer Shayne Ward also appeared on the show.

{"context": "Meet the women campaigning to become Mexico's first female president\n\nOpinion polls have given Xóchitl Gálvez and Claudia Sheinbaum a wide lead over their rivals\n\nAs Claudia Sheinbaum, the front-runner in Mexico’s presidential election, arrives for a rally in a packed park in the colonial city of Orizaba, the crowd starts to chant \"Presidenta!\" Those attending are convinced that is what she is about to become: Mexico’s first ever woman president. The polls suggest they may well be right. With her closest rival, Xóchitl Gálvez, also a woman, and the only man in the presidential race a distant third, Mexico is almost certainly set to break centuries of male domination of the country’s highest office.\n\nXóchitl Gálvez is the candidate for a coalition of opposition parties\n\nIn fluent English, Ms Sheinbaum, who belongs to the governing Morena party, says the fact that both leading candidates are women is a sign that Mexican society is finally evolving. “It’s a symbol for Mexico. I think it’s also a symbol for the world,” she told the BBC. “Mexico has been called a machista country for many years. But Mexicans are now governed by many women and that’s a change,” says the former mayor of Mexico City, referring to the gender parity i", "continuation": "n the cabinet and the high number of women serving as state governors. “I see young girls who are excited that a woman is going to be president. And it changes the culture for women and for men.”\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum wants to become the first female president in Mexican history\n\nMexico is a country where around 11 women a day are murdered on average and Ms Sheinbaum was quick to acknowledge that more needed to be done to reduce violence against women. That is easier said than done. Veracruz is one of the five worst states for femicides in the country. Just days before the candidate’s visit to the eastern state, the body of 23-year-old Isamar Galindo was found with her hands tied, tortured, wrapped in a blanket and dumped in a canal. \"Profound cultural changes don’t happen overnight,\" says Ms Sheinbaum of the ingrained problems of machismo and gender-based violence in Mexican society. Throughout the campaign, her message has remained the same. If elected, she says, she will continue the social and political process launched by her mentor, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Their supporters call it the \"Fourth Transformation of Mexico\", comparing it with other key moments in Mexican history including independence and the Mexican Revolution. Mr López Obrador – commonly known by his initials as Amlo – has introduced a series of social development measures to alleviate poverty including student grants and a universal state pension. The programmes are so popular that opposition candidates have been at pains to promise that they will not scrap them.\n\nIn rallies and speeches, Ms Sheinbaum has been careful to praise Amlo and his policies. In return, his support could bring her huge dividends at the polls – perhaps the presidency itself. Opponents, particularly her main rival, Xóchitl Gálvez, say President López Obrador is a populist and paint Ms Sheinbaum as merely his puppet, unable to break free from his outsized personality. The former environmental scientist refutes the characterisation: “I feel sure about myself. I don’t care about these things they say.” “Of course I’m from the same movement as López Obrador. We fought together for more than 20 years to have the government we have, for the opportunities and rights we’ve won for Mexicans.” “I’m going to live a different time in history, but I’m going to govern with the same principles and that’s a good thing for Mexican people.”\n\nThe BBC requested an interview with Ms Gálvez but she declined. During the campaign Ms Gálvez, who is running for a conservative opposition coalition, accused the government of cronyism and widespread abuses of power. She also criticised social spending during President López Obrador’s six years in power as mismanaged and unevenly distributed. \"In the face of the government’s failed social policies, Mexicans’ monthly budgets are stretched too thin. There are nine million people in extreme poverty,\" she said in the last televised debate, promising to lower the pensionable age to 60 from 65. Away from the noise of the campaign, high in the Veracruz mountains, the conditions are ideal for growing some of the finest coffee in the world. The coffee bean is at the heart of tight-knit rural communities like Ixhuatlán del Café, home to a women’s coffee cooperative called FemCafe. In most Mexican agricultural co-ops, women are not allowed to vote or hold decision-making roles. But at FemCafe the entire enterprise, from bean to cup, is in the hands of women.\n\nGisela Illescas says women have had little influence in Mexican agriculture\n\n\"It’s about recognising that structural inequality – that women have much less access to land than men,\" says the cooperative’s founder, Gisela Illescas. \"Although women have always been in coffee production, we’ve been made invisible, denied the power to influence the overall direction or the day-to-day running of production.\" As well as producing their own brand, FemCafe members also run a small coffee shop in town. Gisela Illescas offered some advice for the next president: \"It’s not just about being a woman but about being gender-conscious, which is a very different thing. For example, the agricultural ministry has never been led by a woman. And a women’s perspective in that role would make a huge difference to the rural sector,\" she says. In the Claudia Sheinbaum rally in Orizaba, the crowd’s other main chant is \"la primera!\", meaning “the first.” In fact, other nations in Latin America have had female presidents in the past – including Brazil, Chile and Argentina – but a woman at the helm in Mexico is hugely significant, and long overdue. The more complex task, however, lies in undoing decades of sexism, inequality and gender-based violence in a deeply patriarchal society."}

{"context": "Sara Sharif's body was found at her home in Woking on 10 August last year\n\nThe father and stepmother of 10-year-old Sara Sharif have been found guilty of her murder after subjecting her to \"horrific suffering\" for more than two years. Sara was hooded, burned and beaten during a campaign of abuse before her body was found with dozens of injuries at the family's home in Woking, Surrey, last year. Her father, Urfan Sharif, 43, and stepmother, Beinash Batool, 30, were found guilty of murder on Wednesday, while her uncle, Faisal Malik, 29, was convicted of causing or allowing a child's death. Following the verdict, Det Ch Supt Mark Chapman of Surrey Police said he had never seen \"such horrific suffering of a young person\" in his 30-year career.\n\n“It's one of those cases that touches every single person who's involved in it, and I'm sure has touched many members of the community as well,” he added. Det Ch Insp Craig Emmerson added that Sara's murder was \"one of the most difficult and distressing\" cases that Surrey Police had ever dealt with. In a statement read outside the Old Bailey, he said: \"The murder of a child is absolutely shocking, but the abuse Sara suffered during her short life has made this case particularly disturbing.\" Children's commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza said Sara's murder highlighted \"profound weaknesses in our child protection system\". \"There can be no doubt that Sara was failed in the starkest terms by the safety net of services around her,\" she said. \"Even before she was born, she was known to social care, and yet she fell off their radar so entirely that by the time she died, she was invisible to them all. \"We can have no more reviews, no more strategies, no more debate.

However, in a dramatic U-turn under cross-examination, Sharif later accepted \"full responsibility\" for his daughter's death. Sara's mother, Olga Domin, has paid tribute to her, stating: \"Sara's smile could brighten up the darkest room.\" She said her child had beautiful brown eyes, an angelic voice and a unique character. \"She will always be in our hearts, her laughter will bring warmth to our lives,\" she said. \"We miss Sara very much. Love you, princess.\" Sharif married Ms Domin in 2009 but they separated in 2015, with accusations of abuse made against each other in a custody battle. In 2019, Sara was living with her mother when Guildford's family court awarded custody to Sharif, who had by then divorced Ms Domin and married Batool.\n\nSara's father Urfan Sharif and stepmother Beinash Batool have been convicted over her death\n\nSara had more than 70 new external injuries when her body was found by police. She had suffered 11 fractures to her spine, burns to her buttocks caused by a domestic iron, signs of a traumatic brain injury and six probable human bite marks. Dental impressions ruled out that the bite marks had been caused by the male defendants, but Batool had refused to provide samples.

Accounts from neighbours were shared with the court, including a woman who lived near the family's previous address in West Byfleet, who recalled “shockingly loud” sounds of smacking and “gut wrenching screams” of young girls.\n\nDuring the trial, Sharif claimed he came home on the evening on 8 August 2023 to find his wife sitting on the floor in the couple's bedroom, holding Sara. Giving evidence, he said Batool told him the girl had fallen down the stairs while playing with another child, and that she was “being dramatic\".

In the call, which lasted eight minutes and 34 seconds, he said he “legally punished her” and she died. Later in the call, he said that Sara had been naughty and that he then beat her up. “It wasn’t my intention to kill her, but I beat her up too much,\" Sharif went on to tell the operator.\n\nUrfan Sharif left a note found near Sara's body, tucked under a pillow, in which he confessed to killing his daughter\n\nIn his evidence at the Old Bailey, Sharif began by claiming his confessions were false before relenting and admitting “full responsibility” for Sara’s death. He unexpectedly told the jury: “I admit what I said in my phone call and my written note. Every single word.” However, he later denied intending to kill Sara and declined to change his plea. He told the court he was lying when he called his wife, Batool, a “psycho” earlier in the trial. Sharif admitted beating Sara, but denied biting or burning her. Batool and Malik did not give evidence during the trial. Mr Justice Cavanagh told the Old Bailey on Wednesday: \"This case, above any other, has been stressful and traumatic.\"\n\nCCTV images of the family at Heathrow Airport\n\nLibby Clark, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said Sara was a \"happy, outgoing and lively child\" who died at the hands of those closest to her. \"In a small house with such a big family, it would have been immediately obvious to all the adults what was happening to Sara.

Trans people exist, and schools need clear guidance for young people - Phillipson\n\nLabour's education spokesperson Bridget Phillipson has avoided saying whether the party would scrap a proposed ban on schools in England teaching pupils about gender identity. Earlier this year, the Conservative government published draft guidance which says the concept should not be taught. Setting out the guidance in May, Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said it would provide teachers with \"more clarity\". Speaking on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Ms Phillipson said there were \"good\" principles in the guidance but that \"other elements\" had \"drifted far too much into partisan and unnecessary language\". She also said she was \"genuinely sorry to hear\" of JK Rowling's doubts about voting Labour. Writing in the Times,, external the Harry Potter author and former party donor criticised Keir Starmer's stance on women's and trans rights and accused the party of \"abandoning women\". Responding to the comments, Ms Phillipson said she had \"a real degree of respect\" for the writer but argued that her party had a strong record on women's rights.\n\nDuring her interview, Ms Phillipson was repeatedly asked if a future Labour government would implement draft guidance prohibiting schools from teaching the concept of gender identity. She said \"we absolutely do need to see guidance\" adding that it was important to provide \"clarity\" for teachers ", "continuation": "on \"how to manage what is a sensitive and difficult area for them\". \"But let’s make sure that children’s wellbeing is at the heart of this. Let’s stop this being a political football.\" She said the government's draft guidance included \"unnecessary language that I think makes it harder for schools to navigate this\". \"There are trans people; they have a right for their existence to be recognised. Many trans people are vulnerable and are deserving of support.\" Ms Keegan has said schools should \"not be providing classroom materials that, for example, include the view that gender is a spectrum\". \"While protected characteristics such as gender reassignment should be taught about, that must be done on a factual basis at an appropriate age and must not be based on contested ideology.\"\n\nLabour has faced criticism from some of its own MPs and supporters over its position on transgender rights. Ms Rowling, who donated £1m to Labour in 2008, wrote in The Times: \"As long as Labour remains dismissive and often offensive towards women fighting to retain the rights their foremothers thought were won for all time, I'll struggle to support them. \"For left-leaning women like us this isn't, and never has been, about trans people enjoying the rights of every other citizen and being free to present and identify however they wish. \"This is about the right of women and girls to assert their boundaries.\" Under the Equality Act 2010, it is illegal to discriminate against anyone because of \"protected characteristics\" - a set of identifying traits that are protected by law and include age, disability, religion, race, sex and sexual orientation among others. Some interpret sex in this context as referring strictly to biological sex, while others believe it also applies to people with a gender recognition certificate; a legal document that allows someone to change the legal sex on their birth certificate. Earlier this year, the Conservatives pledged to rewrite the Equality Act to apply to biological sex, making it simpler for services such as rape crisis centres to stop biological males from taking part. Responding to Ms Rowling's comments, Ms Phillipson said: \"I want to make sure that women get the support and the justice that they deserve and that we do make sure that we’ve got services that are available for women, around rape and sexual violence. \"There are important provisions already there within the Equality Act that allow for single sex provision and it’s important those are maintained. \"But let’s, alongside that, make sure that trans people too get the support that they need. I don’t believe it’s an either/or but I would say really, do judge us on what we’ve done in the past to support women.\""}

The critically acclaimed 2023 work delves into the impact of the digital world - including social media and AI - on our culture, politics and identity.

Chair of the judges for the fiction prize, author Monica Ali, said: \"Brotherless Night is a brilliant, compelling and deeply moving novel that bears witness to the intimate and epic-scale tragedies of the Sri Lankan civil war. \"In rich, evocative prose, Ganeshananthan creates a vivid sense of time and place and an indelible cast of characters. \"Her commitment to complexity and clear-eyed moral scrutiny combines with spellbinding storytelling to render Brotherless Night a masterpiece of historical fiction.\" The novel follows Sashi, a 16-year-old aspiring doctor, growing up in Jaffna in the 1980s. Her close family is torn apart by the onset of civil war.\n\nDoppelganger starts as a tale of the author's struggles to stop being mistaken for Naomi Wolf and goes on to delve into all manner of topics, including numerous conspiracy theories. Wolf is best known for her acclaimed third-wave feminist book The Beauty Myth and other works such as Give Me Liberty: A Handbook for American Revolutionaries. In 2019, one of her books was cancelled by a US publisher over accuracy concerns and in 2021, she was suspended from X (then known as Twitter) for spreading anti-vaccine misinformation. Suzannah Lipscomb, chair of judges for the non-fiction award, said of Klein's winning book: \"This brilliant and layered analysis demonstrates humour, insight and expertise.

Lying 2,500km (1,550 miles) east of the Philippines, Saipan is on the way to nowhere.\n\nAssange didn't speak to reporters as he left court\n\nInside the courtroom though it was all business. Even Assange, whose appearance has taken some wild turns over the past 14 years, had smartened up, tightening his rumpled brown tie and sporting a black jacket. Judge Ramona Manglona, who was hearing what must have been", "continuation": " the biggest case of her career, would not be rushed. She picked over each detail of the deal the Wikileaks founder had struck with US government prosecutors to end their long legal battle, repeatedly checking that he was happy with what he had agreed. At times looking a little nervous he responded firmly to every question that yes, he was happy. There was little of the bravado he had shown in his former years. Both Julian Assange and the prosecutors appeared worn down by their long feud, and anxious to get to the end of the hearing. There was just one flash of the old Assange when he was asked by the judge if he now accepted that he had broken the law. He replied that when he was running Wikileaks, and dropping thousands of classified documents into the public realm, he believed this action was protected by the first amendment of the US constitution guaranteeing freedom of expression, and that he believed the Espionage Act, under which he was being charged, was in conflict with that amendment. But it did not last long. Yes, he acknowledged, whatever I thought then I do now accept that I have broken that law.\n\nOutside the courthouse people were baffled by the sudden invasion of journalists, something unfamiliar in a place which sees little news. I was last here when I accompanied Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, 19 years before Julian Assange brought his fame to Saipan. The territory, capital of the Northern Mariana Islands, was the scene of a particularly nasty battle in World War II when it was under Japanese rule, and troops and civilians were told they could not surrender to the advancing Americans. Hundreds of civilians were persuaded to jump to their deaths from a high cliff in the north of the island. The emperor and empress stood on the edge of the cliff, contemplating the terrible loss of life set in motion by their forebears. Today, people were approaching us with bags of mementos, capitalising on their far-flung island’s moment in the spotlight. Some had no idea who Julian Assange is. There was no opportunity to find out. After two hours of deliberation Judge Manglona announced his release: “An early happy birthday to you,” she said. Assange turns 53 next week. And she reminded him and the prosecutors that Saipan had just celebrated 80 years of peace, since those terrible battles between the Japanese and the Americans and said she hoped he could now find peace in his own life. Within minutes, Julian Assange was in a car to the airport, and on his way back to Australia. And Saipan slipped back into its languid routine of flowers and palms and Korean honeymooners strolling the beaches.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser."}

Greenland, which is an autonomous Danish territory, is home to a large US space facility and lies on the shortest route from North America to Europe, meaning it is strategically important for the US. There was no immediate response to Trump's comments from Denmark.\n• None Trump threatens to try to regain control of Panama Canal\n\nWriting on his social media platform, Truth Social, on Sunday, the US president-elect said: \"For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.\" His comments prompted a sharp rebuke from Greenland's Prime Minister Mute Egede, who said: \"We are not for sale and we will not be for sale.\" \"We must not lose our long struggle for freedom. However, we must continue to be open to co-operation and trade with the whole world, especially with our neighbours,\" he said.\n\nTrump's controversial remarks came hours after he announced that he intended to nominate Ken Howery, his former ambassador to Sweden, to be the new ambassador to Denmark. Mr Howery said he was \"deeply humbled\" by the nomination and looked forward to working with the staff at the US embassy in Copenhagen and the US consulate in Greenland to \"deepen the bonds between our countries\".

Separately on Sunday, Donald Trump threatened to reassert control over the Panama Canal, one of the world's most important waterways - accusing Panama of charging excessive fees for access to it.

Debbie Duncan's 19-year-old son Jay Slater, from Oswaldtwistle in Lancashire, has not been seen or heard from for over 48 hours. He had flown to the Canary island with friends to attend the NRG music festival. Search teams, relatives and friends have been looking for the apprentice bricklayer in the mountainous Rural de Teno national park.\n\nMs Duncan told the PA News Agency: \"It’s just traumatic and it doesn’t feel real. It’s just awful, it’s horrendous. \"He’s just a great person who everyone wanted to be with.

Jay’s friend Lucy Mae – who had gone to the island with him to attend the NRG music festival – has said Jay had gone to stay with people he had met on a night out, in the north-west of the island. She has said she was called by him shortly before 09:00 on Monday to say he was trying to make the 10-hour walk back to their accommodation in the south of the island, but needed water and had only 1% battery life left on his phone.

Bayrou told BFMTV he thought the \"alarmist and sometimes terrifying numbers put forward won't be borne out in reality\". The confirmed death toll on Mayotte so far is 35 but, in the immediate aftermath of the cyclone, local prefect François-Xavier Bieuville feared that it would \"definitely be several hundred\" and could reach thousands. The prefect told France Info radio on Tuesday that investigations in the field were progressing well that \"allow us to think that we will corroborate this figure of 35\".\n\nDefending his initial remarks, Bieuville insisted \"I have never been alarmist, I was simply unable to give the number of victims\". Officials said it had been difficult to determine the scale of fatalities in the wake of the disaster 10 days ago, due to many areas of Mayotte being inaccessible and the fact that victims were buried within 24 hours in accordance with Islamic customs. There is also uncertainty about the true population of Mayotte, a French Indian Ocean territory.

The archipelago is one of the poorest parts of France, with many of its residents living in shanty towns. Cyclone Chido was the worst storm to hit the territory in 90 years, bringing winds of up to 260 km/h (160mph) and flattening areas where people lived in shacks with metal roofs. France held a day of national mourning in the wake of the cyclone on Monday. President Emmanuel Macron visited the territory last week, and was heckled by angry locals demanding more aid in devastated areas. Some survivors went for a week without water, communication or electricity. Authorities restored water in the main points of the territory on Tuesday, Bieuville said. \"Even if this water is still sometimes a little difficult to deliver, our fellow citizens have water.\" He also said there was no fuel shortage any more and cars could now be filled up. The prime minister had earlier said that a field hospital would also be operational by Tuesday morning. Cyclone Chido moved on to continental Africa after hitting Mayotte, killing 120 people in Mozambique and 13 in Malawi."}

Pace bowler Atkinson bowled Nathan Smith off an attempted leave, had Matt Henry fend to gully, then trapped last man Tim Southee lbw. It continued an astonishing first year in Test cricket for the 26-year-old, who took 12 wickets on his debut against West Indies at Lord's in July. He followed up with a century and a five-wicket haul at the same venue against Sri Lanka in August. Atkinson's burst wrapped up the New Zealand innings for 125 and left them 155 runs behind England's 280. It was the first hat-trick by an England bowler in Test cricket since Moeen Ali against South Africa at The Oval in 2017 and the first in an away Test since Ryan Sidebottom against New Zealand in Hamilton 16 years ago. Overall, Atkinson became the 14th Englishman to take a Test hat-trick - Stuart Broad has two. \"The hat-trick ball I was running up thinking 'I'm getting a wicket this ball, I'm getting a wicket this ball' - I did feel it,\" Atkinson told BBC Sport. \"I haven't really thought about a hat-trick too much before. You want to play to get five-fors as a bowler, you don't think about hat-tricks as much, but getting a hat-trick is special, it's definitely more rare than a five-for. \"I took one for school, probably 2015.

Atkinson's three wickets in three balls is also the first hat-trick taken at the historic Basin Reserve. New Zealand resumed on 86-5, 194 adrift. Brydon Carse needed only 10 balls of his spell to take Tom Blundell's off stump and, in the same over, nightwatchman Will O'Rourke was plumb lbw.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said her party would reduce the need for overseas workers by improving training of British workers. She argued that not setting a target was \"sensible\" because the Conservatives had \"discredited the whole system\" by previously missing targets. But the Tories said \"no-one believes Keir Starmer is serious about tackling immigration\".\n\nSpeaking on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Ms Cooper acknowledged that new salary levels announced by the government were yet to \"play through\" and would further restrict companies' access to work visas. But she added that Labour wanted to go further to cut reliance on foreign workers in sectors including construction, IT, social care, health and engineering.\n\nThe party says if it wins power, it will pass a new law to force different parts of the government to draw up skills improvement plans in high-migration sectors. It is not yet clear how these plans would be enforced. Ms Cooper said Labour wanted to see \"significant changes in place” across the economy to reduce reliance on overseas workers. But she added the party would not set a migration target because the Conservatives had \"ended up being totally all over the place\" when they did. She also argued that other factors would produce variations “from one year to another,\" citing the pandemic and the UK's decision to accept Ukrainian refugees as recent examples.

Earlier this year, the government introduced new laws designed to cut immigration numbers. They included increasing the minimum salary requirement for some skilled work visas by nearly 50%, as well as increasing the salary requirements for skilled workers, British citizens and those with settled status to bring family dependents into the UK. Ms Cooper said Labour supported \"some further restrictions on visas\" introduced by the government. Labour also wants to lengthen the bans on hiring foreign workers that can be handed down to firms that breach employment law, such as by paying below the minimum wage. A spokesperson for the Conservative Party said the Labour policy announced on Sunday was a \"U-turn\" on Sir Keir's principles. \"This is the man who called all immigration laws racist and voted against tougher border controls 139 times,\" the spokesperson said. That refers to a book review Sir Keir wrote when he was a lawyer in the late 1980s, in which he said the author had highlighted the \"racist undercurrent which permeates all immigration law\". Alison Thewliss, from the SNP, said: “Instead of coming forward with policies based on Scotland’s needs, Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are both amping up the far-right belief that migrants are to blame for all of our problems - but it’s not migrants, it’s Westminster.\" \"From our care sector and our NHS to our economy, the cruel immigration policies that both the Tories and Keir Starmer’s Labour have now adopted directly harm Scotland,\" she said.

In an interview with former Italy international Luca Toni for Amazon Prime Sport before Wednesday's Champions League defeat by Juventus, Guardiola touched on the personal impact City's sudden downturn in form has had. Guardiola said his state of mind was \"ugly\", that his sleep was \"worse\" and he was eating lighter as his digestion had suffered. City go into Sunday's derby against Manchester United at Etihad Stadium having won just one of their past 10 games. The Juventus loss means there is a chance they may not even secure a play-off spot in the Champions League.

To emphasise his point, Guardiola referred back to the third game of City's current run, against a Sporting side managed by Ruben Amorim, who will be in the United dugout at the weekend. City dominated the first half in Lisbon, led thanks to Phil Foden's early effort and looked to be cruising. Instead, they conceded three times in 11 minutes either side of half-time as Sporting eventually ran out 4-1 winners. \"I would like to play the game like we played in Lisbon on Sunday, believe me,\" said Guardiola, who is facing the prospect of only having three fit defenders for the derby as Nathan Ake and Manuel Akanji try to overcome injury concerns. If there is solace for City, it comes from the knowledge United are not exactly flying. Their comeback Europa League victory against Viktoria Plzen on Thursday was their third win of Amorim's short reign so far but only one of those successes has come in the Premier League, where United have lost their past two games against Arsenal and Nottingham Forest. Nevertheless, Guardiola can see improvements already on the red side of the city. \"It's already there,\" he said. \"You see all the patterns, the movements, the runners and the pace. He will do a good job at United, I'm pretty sure of that.\"\n\nGuardiola says skipper Kyle Walker has been offered support by the club after the City defender highlighted the racial abuse he had received on social media in the wake of the Juventus trip. \"It's unacceptable,\" he said. \"Not because it's Kyle - for any human being. \"Unfortunately it happens many times in the real world.

{"context": "Sunak promises to relaunch Help to Buy scheme\n\nRishi Sunak has unveiled plans to launch a \"new and improved\" Help to Buy scheme which aims to give people in England a hand with raising deposits to buy their first home. The prime minister has said he would also permanently abolish stamp duty for first-time buyers on homes up to £425,000, if he wins the general election. The Conservative manifesto - setting out the party's policy priorities for government - also includes a target of 1.6 million new homes over five years, slightly more than Labour is promising. Mr Sunak also committed the Conservatives to continuing its mortgage guarantee scheme, matching Labour’s pledge to do so. For renters, the Tories say they would ban no-fault evictions, something they first promised to do at the 2019 general election. Landlords would also not have to pay tax on profits when selling properties to tenants, under Tory plans. Mr Sunak says this will give tenants \"a chance to own the home they live in\", but landlord groups say this will not address shortages in homes available to let.\n\nOpposition parties have seized on Mr Sunak's admission during a BBC interview on Monday that it has become harder for people to own their own homes since the Conservatives have been in office. Unveiling the Conservative manifesto at Silverstone race track, he said the new Help to Buy scheme would \"get a new generation onto the property ladder\". The scheme would provide first-time buyers with an equity loan of up to 20% towards the cost of a new-build home. This will allow them to get buy a first home with a 5% deposit, according to the manifesto. The scheme would last three years, with developers contributing towards loan costs and no interest on the government loan for the first five years. The Times reports that the scheme would be available for purchases under £400,000. Hundreds of thousands of people have been bought through the Help to Buy scheme since it was launched in 2013 - although it has also been criticised as the \"crack cocaine of the building industry,\" and blamed for pushing up house prices. The original scheme ended in March 2023 for England, although first-time buyers can still apply for loans under it in Wales.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies said the New Help to Buy Scheme could help potential homebuyers get on the property ladder by reducing deposits and making payments more manageable i", "continuation": "n the short term. But the think tank also warned that it was a subsidy for the housing market that in the past had led to higher house prices and profits for developers - and that \"some who buy would be able to do so without the scheme\". Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said: \"Help to Buy has been proven to do more harm to our housing system than good. \"Not only does it drive up house prices and help only a small minority of people, it ultimately takes money away from building genuinely affordable housing.\" Nathan Emerson, chief executive at property professionals' body Propertymark said: \"Ultimately, we need a fully robust supply of new sustainable housing that is keeping pace with an ever-growing demand.\"\n\nThe prime minister also said that, if re-elected, the Tories would scrap capital gains tax for landlords who sell their property to existing tenants. Landlords currently have to pay the tax on profits they make from a sale, and Mr Sunak said the proposed tax relief would \"incentivise landlords to give tenants a chance to own the home they live in\". \"It is good for landlords and transformational for tenant,\" he wrote in the Telegraph. The National Residential Landlords Association said: “Tenants who want to become homeowners should be supported to do so. \"Whilst incentivising landlords to sell to existing tenants has the potential to help, it will not reverse the damage to the rental market caused by tax hikes under recent Conservative governments.\" The Conservatives have a target to build 300,000 new homes in England per year by the \"mid-2020s\", which it is yet to meet. Labour has pledged a similar target of building 1.5m homes over a five-year period in England if it is elected. It has promised radical plans to streamline the planning system, although details are yet to be announced. The Liberal Democrats, who launched their manifesto on Monday, are pledging to build 380,000 new homes a year across the UK, including a specific annual target of 150,000 social homes."}

{"context": "Gavin Robinson has said his party will \"continue to fight to fully restore Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom\"\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader has brought the Irish Sea border into the centre of Northern Ireland’s election campaign. That internal trade border exists as a result of the UK’s 2019 Brexit deal with the EU. It has been modified, simplified and repackaged in subsequent deals but is still there. As he was confirmed as leader this week Gavin Robinson told his party: \"We will continue to fight to fully restore Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom, including removing the application of EU law in our country and the internal Irish Sea Border it creates.\" This is a change in rhetoric from February when the DUP decided to return to Stormont after a two year boycott in protest at the sea border.\n\nThe then DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said a UK-EU deal and a side-deal between the government and the DUP \"takes away the border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and that is something very important\". There was nuance if you looked for it, with Sir Jeffrey acknowledging the deal was not perfect, but the overall DUP message was effectively: \"Sea border gone. Back to Stormont. Let’s move on.\" Mr Robinson has decided that position is not sustainable in an election campaign where the deal will be challenged and unpicked by unionist rivals. He conceded the deal had been oversold and there should have been more \"cautious realism\" at the time. Mr Robinson has been moving to this position since he became interim DUP leader in March. He gave an interview to the BBC’s Talkback programme, which he described as \"boringly detailed\", outlining the nuances of what had been agreed. That looked like a move towards a more defensible position in the face of criticism of the deal from dissenting voices, some of which are inside his own party.\n\n\"It’s an electoral tightrope,\" says Prof Jon Tonge, professor of politics at Liverpool University. \"The electorate might reward you for your honesty or they might feel a bit aggrieved.\" He says polling suggests that the bulk of DUP supporters were content with the return to Stormont but a minority were not and it is that smaller group which is being targeted with the new approach. \"It’s about the part of the DUP base which isn’t happy with what has happened. That will really determine the fate of the DUP in a number of constituencies,\" he says. The DUP cannot by itself change the operation of the sea border or the application of EU law in Northern Ireland. There will be a democratic consent vote at Stormont later in 2024 on ending or continuing the current arrangements. That is a simple majority vote meaning non-unionist parties have the numbers to continue with the current arrangements. There are also two \"democratic consent mechanisms\" at Stormont which gives the assembly the power to recommend the blocking of new or updated EU rules from applying in NI. However it is ultimately for the UK government to decide. It would be open to a new UK government to ask the EU to reopen negotiations on the Northern Ireland Brexit deal but the Queens University expert Prof David Phinnemore says that is very unlikely. \"I can’t see there being any push to change the Windsor Framework,\" he says, referring to the current Northern Ireland deal. \"The negotiating space there with the EU has been exhausted. If there’s going to be any change it’s going to come through the wider EU-UK relationship.\"\n\nKier Starmer said he is \"not interested in a deal that puts the UK in a position of being a rule taker\"\n\nOne of Labour’s clearest and most consistent polices is that it will seek a new agreement for agri-food products traded between the UK and EU with the aim to “eliminate most border checks created by the Tory Brexit deal\". Such a deal could at a stroke sweep away the most obvious physical impacts of the Irish Sea border and end some of the most onerous paperwork. In simple terms if a deal ends checks on goods moving from Calais to Dover then checks will also end from Cairnryan to Belfast. Agrifood deals from the EU fall into two broad categories: New Zealand-style or Swiss-style. A Swiss-style deal is the more dramatic. Since 2009, there have been no regulatory border controls for trade in agrifood products between Switzerland and the EU. But the Swiss only have this deal because they agreed to follow EU rules almost to the letter, without much say in setting those rules. Switzerland is obliged to modify its laws in response to changes in EU legislation, what is known as dynamic alignment. When BBC NI asked Keir Starmer about this last year he said: \"I'm not interested in a deal that puts the UK in a position of being a rule taker. Our rules must be made in Westminster, according to the national interest of the UK as a whole.\" Mujtaba Rahman, a managing director at the Eurasia Group consultancy and long-time Brexit watcher, says an agrifood deal will nonetheless be high on the agenda. \"The likely priority of a Starmer government will be renewed foreign and security policy cooperation with the EU, while simultaneously addressing a number of irritants that flow from the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). \"A deal to reduce friction on agricultural goods is likely to be one of those priorities.\"\n\nThe general e", "continuation": "lection is to elect Members of Parliament - or MPs - to the House of Commons.

Then, later that day, when Megumi, a relative newbie at the sport, cut her hand on the wall, Gordon jumped in to offer her an antiseptic wipe.

Dating apps, a common way to meet a partner, have seen a significant drop in user numbers this year, says communications regulator Ofcom. But other more traditional pathways to finding love, such as meeting someone at work or on a night out, have also seen a lot of disruption recently. Shifting attitudes towards working from home are seen by many as good for work/life balance, but spending less time with colleagues can also mean less opportunity to meet new people. This autumn, more than 10% of Britons were working remotely and over a quarter were working hybrid patterns (a mix of home and office working), according to ONS data, external - significantly higher than pre-pandemic figures, external. Meanwhile, NHS data, external shows that average weekly alcohol consumption had declined slightly in the decade to 2022 and the Night Time Industries Association warns, external that UK night clubs are closing at a rapid rate. But if dating apps, offices and nightclubs are all becoming less of a feature of people's social lives, then what replaces them?\n\nManagers at climbing centres across the UK say their venues are one of the unlikely places people are meeting potential partners. Sarah Moran, manager at Climbing Works in Sheffield, says that she's been on dates with people she's met through climbing. \"They've come up to me and we've chatted a little bit, maybe climbed a little bit together, and at the end we exchanged numbers,\" she says.\n\nRose and Mark's social life is \"based entirely around climbing\"\n\nThe managers say the sport has boomed in popularity since the pandemic, which they mainly put down to its introduction at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, as well as British rock climber Toby Roberts’ win at the Paris 2024 Games. About 400,000 people climb at least twice a month, according to the British Mountaineering Council. There are more than 400 climbing gyms across the UK. Climbers say that it's a \"hyper-social\" sport where you're constantly in close proximity with other people. Gill Peet, manager at Blackburn climbing wall Onyx, likens climbing centres to a \"grown-up youth club\". She says climbers are \"almost forced\" to socialise because of the time spent on the mats between each climb, catching their breath, planning out their next route or asking for advice. The socialising often continues post-workout, too, with climbers grabbing a coffee or pizza together with many climbing centres having their own cafes. \"I do more talking at the climbing wall than I do climbing,\" Rose Henderson says. Rose met her partner, Mark Garbe, in 2015 at a climbing group organised through the socialising app Meetup. The pair, both 33, quickly hit it off and now live together in Ayrshire. Mark says their social life is \"based entirely around climbing\". They've been on group holidays to Fontainebleau, a climbing hotspot in France, and cycled the Hebridean Way with their climbing friends. They choose their holiday destinations based on whether there are climbing centres nearby and watch climbing world cups together.\n\nRose and Mark have made lots of friends through climbing\n\nMany climbing centres host social events, including women's and LBGT nights, where climbers of a range of abilities can get to know other people. Kaloyan Galev, 21, met his partner Samuel Prentice, 22, at a student climbing event in early 2020. Kaloyan has taken part in multiple sports competitively but says climbing is the only one he knows of that hosts specific \"LGBT nights\". Climbing walls are \"very accepting\", he says.\n\nKaloyan and Samuel met at a student climbing event in early 2020\n\nMillions of Brits use dating apps - about 10% of UK adults who use the internet and 4.9 million people used online dating services in May, according to a new report from Ofcom, external. But after soaring in popularity following the introduction of Tinder in 2014, user numbers are now falling. The four most popular dating apps in the UK - Tinder, Hinge, Bumble and Grindr - all lost UK users between May 2023 and May 2024, says Ofcom's report. The number of UK adults using Tinder dropped 23% and Bumble users fell 26%. Hinge, which has the youngest user base of the mainstream dating apps, experienced a 9% drop in users.\n\nMariko Visserman, a psychology lecturer at the University of Sussex who studies romantic relationships, says \"choice overload\" is causing some people to become tired of online dating. This, combined with some users' \"very high expectations and standards\", often leads to disappointment, she says. Before he met Kaloyan at a climbing event, Samuel had tried out dating apps. \"I find it just hard to get something going with a stranger just through an online profile,\" he says. \"Almost feels like squeezing water from a stone sometimes.\" Climbing, in comparison, is \"such a low pressure place to meet,\" Gill says. \"You're not specifically there to find someone, you're just there to climb.\" And when you climb together, you \"quickly learn a lot about someone\", says James Lister, marketing manager at Depot Climbing, a chain of climbing walls. You can see how they react when they’re frustrated at a route, happy with an achievement and socialising with a group of people, he adds. It's a lot of \"red or green flag ticking,\" he says.\n\nBefore she met Jack, Kellie had told her friends she couldn't date someone who didn't climb\n\n\"I'd find it hard to be with someone who didn't climb,\" says Kellie Burston, 35, who works as a planning and permitting manager. \"I said to friends, 'I couldn't date someone who wasn't a climber.'\" She'd filled her dating apps with photos of her climbing and doing outdoor activities in the hope of finding a match with similar interests but had no luck. Kellie met her partner Jack Toon, 32, a HGV driver, at Depot Climbing in Sheffield. They were both hooked on the sport, and \"we just kept seeing each other,\" Jack says. After a while, Kellie and Jack struck up a conversation on Instagram. Their first date was climbing together - a \"cheap date\", Kellie says, since they both had membership. Kellie says she'd always hoped to meet someone this way, but thought it was a pipe dream. The couple have now been together four years and are getting married in Las Vegas next year. They usually climb together about four times a week and live just a 15 minute drive from the wall they met at."}

{"context": "Mott & Buttler reach point of no return with England\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. All of Australia's 13 sixes in 36 run win over England at T20 World Cup\n\nWhen Jonny Bairstow spoke to the media on Friday he insisted defeat by Australia would not \"derail\" England’s campaign. Twenty-four hours later, when Australia openers David Warner and Travis Head were in full flow, it felt like England's train was teetering on the tracks. At that point sitting in the Greenidge and Haynes stand should have come with a health warning. Those behind on Rihanna Drive, the street where the pop star grew up, needed more than an umbrella for protection.\n\nIn a five-over spell Australia scored 70 runs, hitting seven of the 13 bruising sixes in their innings. England scrapped to keep themselves in the game but that proved too big an advantage to overhaul. Defeat leaves Jos Buttler's side in a perilous position in their group, likely needing to beat Oman and Namibia well to progress to the Super 8 stage at the expense of a Scotland side who would like nothing more than to dump out their rivals. But, perhaps more importantly, it brings back to the surface familiar questions about the direction of this England white-ball side under captain Buttler and coach Matthew Mott. The Jacksperiment in Bridgetown - part-timer Will Jacks bowling the second over which began with two sixes and cost 22 runs - can now be added to list of missteps during last year's 50-over World Cup in India, that included the selection hokey-cokey in the opening games and the decision to bowl first in the Mumbai heat against South Africa. These decisions are easy to criticise in hindsight but at some stage their bold calls have to start coming off. Afterwards Buttler said bowling Jacks, making it the first time England have begun with two spinners in a T20, was a \"gut call\", having seen Moeen Ali's opener cost only three runs. But part-time off-spinner Jacks had only bowled two overs in T20s for England. Seamer Jofra Archer, who has dismissed Warner nine times in 19 overs across formats, was waiting in the deep. Ask Warner or Head who they would rather face and there would be only one answer. This was a case of England overthinking.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Head and Warner punish Jacks with three sixes in second over\n\nThe decision to omit Reece Topley was another Buttler had to defend in his post-match news conference with the seamer's record against left-handers like Warner and Head – an average of 19.8 in all T20s since the last World Cup in 2022 - among the best in the world. When Mark Wood began with two leg-side deliveries and a full toss, each duly dispatched to the Kensington Oval's short boundary by Warner - the first out of the ground towards the beach huts and rum punch on Carlisle Bay - saw Topley's absence laid bare. On announcing this squad England's managing director of men’s cricket Rob Key backed Mott and Buttler unreservedly but also spoke of Topley's importance to the side. He was billed as the man to share the new ball with Archer. Six weeks later Topley finds himself carrying the drinks and unable to get into the XI. Having been described by Mott as \"sloppy\" in the 10 overs possible amid the rain against Scotland, England's fielding was again far from perfect. Archer was the most obvious recipient of a Jonny Bairstow glare and an Adil Rashid stare when he failed to dive to stop a Marcus Stoinis boundary. Adam Zampa, who would later superbly tie England’s batters down with his leg-spin, delivered his cutting assessment of his opposition in the field. \"I think they were under the pump and it showed,\" he said. \"Our leadership isn't like that, they are very calm.\" They were brief words that said a lot more.\n\nEngland's dressing room was said to be down in the aftermath and they now have five days to stew on the result. They will hope a change of scenery in Antigua - they make the hour-long flight from Barbados on Sunday - brings about a change in fortunes. Next for England is Oman on Thursday, followed by Namibia less than 48 hours later. Even if they win both, a quirk of the fixture list means Australia and Scotland could go into their meeting in St Lucia on 16 June, the final match of the group, knowing a close Australia win would knock England out. Of course the fact England have been here before ", "continuation": "cannot be dismissed.

Buttler and Mott were captain and coach then but oversaw the debacle in India, England's worst World Cup since their rebirth in 2015, which has left them on thin ice. Progression from the Super 8s to the semi-finals would give them breathing space. Failure to even get there would rival last autumn's struggles. Mott and Buttler have reached the point of no return.

{"context": "Hundreds of driving examiners to be recruited to cut wait times\n\nHundreds of driving examiners will be recruited to cut \"sky-high\" wait times for tests, the government has announced. Lilian Greenwood, minister for the future of roads, said \"no one should have to wait six months when they're ready to pass\" their driving test and acknowledged there was a \"huge\" backlog. The recruitment drive is part of a wider plan that the government says will reduce waiting times to seven weeks by December 2025. Driving instructors have branded the current system a \"nightmare\" and expressed doubts that the proposed changes will make any material difference.\n\nFigures released by the Department for Transport (DfT) earlier this year indicated that the number of driving tests taken reached a record level in the 12 months to the end of March, at 1.9 million. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) has now set out a plan to tackle long waits, with learners having to pay more for tests that are booked out by third parties trying to make a profit. Among the measures announced is the recruitment and training of 450 driving examiners across Great Britain. The DVSA will increase the period for changing or cancelling a test without losing money from three working days to 10 working days beforehand in a bid to discourage late cancellations. There will also be a consultation over proposals to increase the amount of time for booking new tests for learners who fail after making serious or dangerous mistakes. Learner drivers currently have to wait 10 working days before being able to book another test. Current rules around tests being booked up to 24 weeks in advance will also be looked at to see if learners could sign up further ahead. Ms Greenwood said passing a driving test was \"a life changing opportunity for millions\" but \"sky-high waiting times for tests in recent years have denied that opportunity to too many people\". \"No one should have to wait six months when they're ready to pass, travel to the other side of the country to take a driving test or be ripped off by unscrupulous websites just because they can't afford to wait,\" she said. \"The scale of the backlog we have inherited is huge, but today's measures are a crucial step to tackle the long driving test wait times, protect learner drivers from being exploited, and support more people to hit the road.\"\n\nLearner driver Kitty Bell said she had a test booked for 16 December before she \"panicked\" a few weeks ago and delayed it. The Durham University student did a mock test with her instructor and, under the pressure, she said she \"forgot everything\" so decided she needed more practice. Hoping for a new test slot in March, Ms Bell was dismayed to find the earliest appointment she could get was for May 2025. \"That's five months to wait, that's insane,\" she said. Diana Mulrain has been teaching learner drivers in Hendon in north-west London for more than 40 years, and is part of a WhatsApp group of local instructors who swap tests between themselves for their students. She described the current system as an \"absolute nightmare\" and said students were incentivised to take the test even if they were not ready to avoid waiting months to try again. Mrs Mulrain said the DVSA had failed to adequately address the issue of test slots", "continuation": " being booked out by brokers.\n\nDriving instructor Diana Mulrain believes the changes do not go far enough\n\nShe said adding more driving examiners only increases the number of tests that can be snapped up by third parties, and she cannot see how those businesses were being prevented from operating. \"What they should do is to stop all bookings other than (for) the pupil. One credit card, one licence, one test. End of,\" she said. A spokesperson for the DVSA said: \"The measures will help make the driving test booking system fairer for learners, better protecting them from exploitation, and continue to provide them with the tools to help them pass their test.\" They added that the agency was encouraging feedback about its booking system and processes. The government says new terms and conditions for driving tests will come into force on 6 January 2025 which \"make it clear that driving instructors and businesses must not book driving tests on behalf of learner drivers they are not teaching\". Only driving instructors or businesses that employ instructors can use the service to book car driving tests, it adds. Helen Ansell has worked as an instructor in Cornwall for four years and said she was \"not very hopeful\" the proposals would change anything. She suggested students should have a training log to ensure learner drivers were not taking up test slots when they were not ready. \"Once they've done a certain numbers of hours with an instructor, say 20 hours, that's when they can book a test,\" she said. The BBC has contacted the DfT for comment on the driving instructors' concerns."}

But this time voters are more concerned about the economy.\n\nA recent survey of 15,000 Taiwanese by Commonwealth Magazine saw most stating that economic development should be their next president's top priority, over national security and cross-strait relations. It was especially crucial for respondents aged between 20 and 39.\n\nAfter eight years in power, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is coming under fire for failing to adequately improve people's lives, especially younger Taiwanese.\n\nRising house prices and rentals, stagnating incomes, a significant youth unemployment rate, and an annual GDP growth hovering around 2% have worried many. More than a third of low-wage workers are aged below 30, according to an analysis provided to the BBC by labour expert Lee Chien-hung from the Chinese Culture University.\n\nIt's given rise to social phenomenon such as the \"beipiao\", youths from poorer parts of Taiwan seeking better jobs in the capital while grappling with rising rents. There's also the \"xiegang\", young workers juggling multiple jobs to earn a decent wage, and the \"yueguangzu\", those who live paycheck to paycheck with no savings.\n\nKaili, a friend of Ziwei's, is a \"beipiao\" from the southern city of Chiayi resigned to a lifetime of renting in Taipei.\n\nWhen it comes to buying her own home \"I've given up hope\", said the 37-year-old, who works in documentary films.\n\n\"I can't see the reason why I should buy.

They \"feel that the cross-strait issue is something political parties just leverage on to win elections\" at the expense of other issues, he added.\n\nOpponents of the DPP are hoping to tap on their frustration.\n\nThe KMT, the other major political party in Taiwan, casts the DPP as corrupt and inept and has promised change. Once the incumbent that ruled the island with an iron grip, it has alternated power with the DPP every eight years since 2000.\n\nBut it is the upstart Taiwan People's Party (TPP) led by Ko Wen-je that has gained traction among young voters, especially those disillusioned with the two main parties. The former surgeon has gained fans for his pragmatic and straight-talking persona, though he has also been criticised for remarks perceived as sexist and homophobic.\n\nMany young people are putting their hope in the Taiwan People's Party\n\nOn a chilly Wednesday night in the port city of Keelung, a crowd made up mostly of young families and couples gathered by the waterfront for a TPP rally. They cheered as speakers urged them to \"smash the blue and green\", a reference to the KMT and DPP's party colours, and waved placards with one of Mr Ko's campaign slogans, \"Keep Promise\".\n\nAmong them was Harrison Wu, a 25-year-old engineer. He voted for the DPP in the last election, but his hopes for the party have curdled into disappointment.\n\n\"[President] Tsai Ing-wen has been too soft,\" he said, before launching into a litany of complaints ranging from exorbitant housing prices and low wages to party corruption scandals.\n\n\"They had control of the legislature for eight years and didn't get anything done. Now they are asking us to vote in a DPP majority again, but what's the point?\"\n\nThe DPP is aware that young people are losing faith in them. It has promised to build more affordable housing, raise the minimum wage, and invest in upskilling younger workers so they can get better jobs.\n\nRead more about the Taiwan election:\n\nIt's also appealing to millennials for their support. Its latest campaign ad is dedicated to the Sunflower Movement generation that organised anti-China protests a decade ago, paving the way for the DPP to kick the KMT out of government in 2016.\n\nWith a melancholic soundtrack, set to shots of people moving backwards and references to the KMT, the ad warns youths that Taiwan's progress achieved under the DPP could be rolled back if they lose power.\n\n\"You feel a bit exhausted, you don't want to speak out because it's too troublesome,\" a young man's voiceover says soothingly. \"But the very thing you didn't want is now returning.\"\n\n\"You once stood up for your beliefs, once saw the vote in your hands as the most important thing… Only you can make the choice so that Taiwan can be our Taiwan.\"\n\nYoung people have been hit by rising house prices and stagnating incomes\n\nFor decades successive Taiwanese governments have discussed how to solve issues such as low wages \"but no matter which party [is in power] it still hasn't been accomplished,\" said Dr Lee, the labour expert.\n\n\"The government must dutifully face society's problems and stop its empty talk.\"\n\nLev Nachman, a political scientist at the National Chengchi University, said this election all three parties have offered similar proposals to help young voters, but whoever wins must make solving economic issues their top priority. \"It will be a bubble that will pop, if they do not.\"\n\nBut in some ways that's already happening. Taiwan is seeing a brain drain as young people seek better prospects elsewhere.\n\nMigration data shows that, excluding the pandemic years, the number of Taiwanese working overseas has steadily increased in the past decade.

{"context": "Who has made Troy's Premier League team of the week?\n\nAfter every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the Week. Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nJordan Pickford (Everton): He made some massive saves and stopped Arsenal in their tracks. Everton have been under the cosh a lot this year and it's good to see him step up. See, just as much as I hammer him, I can also be nice...\n\nDjed Spence (Tottenham): I don't understand why he hasn't been playing, that's a question for Ange Postecoglou. It looked like it wasn't going to work out for him last year, but he's come back in in the summer and worked hard and been patient. Again, he was excellent and solid and looked like he had been playing all season. Nikola Milenkovic (Nottingham Forest): He has been really good for Forest and it's back-to-back games now where he has been scoring from set-pieces. He's been colossal at the back. A lot of people love Murillo next to him, but he is that calm head. Archie Gray (Tottenham): The way he has acquitted and handled himself, I think he's done really well. He was put in at centre-back against Southampton and impressed. He also came through the game at Rangers in midweek with his head held high. Marc Cucurella (Chelsea): I can't deny he's been playing really well for Chelsea this year. He stupidly got sent off at the end of the game but even so he is performing above expectation. When Chelsea first signed him I wasn't so sure. But he's since been a really consistent performer, to the point where Chelsea will probably end up selling Ben Chilwell. That just shows how good the lad has been doing. And he had a great finish as well.\n\nPape Matar Sarr (Tottenham): He's been good for a couple of weeks and this was the kind of game where he gets a goal and he shows his level of class and composure. This time I'm going to stick him in - even if it was only against Southampton. Manuel Ugarte (Manchester United): He has really, really surprised me. I know it's still early days under the new manager, but Ugarte has a bit of bite about him. He's a bit horrible and even at 1-0 down he was making important tackles, blocks and getting attacks started. I thought he was the catalyst as to why they went on to win. I thought if it wasn't for him they wouldn't actually be in the game. An underrated performance that only his team-mates will appreciate.\n\nAmad Diallo (Manchester United): It's been really difficult to pick the forwards this week but Amad Diallo is the only one who is a no-brainer. He was excellent, flipped the Manchester derby on its head. As a young man he just seems to be growing better and better. All that noise around Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford, Diallo just seems to be going about his business and delivering on a regular basis, and that's what it's all about. Ismaila Sarr (Crystal Palace): When I played with him at Watford he was a winger, but at Palace they're playing him as a 10 and he's going to show people just how good of a footballer he is. He is also the quickest person I've ever played with and for his second goal he made", "continuation": " up five yards on Lewis Dunk and then for his finish was about 15 yards ahead. Unbelievable finish and great to see him off the mark and flying at Palace. Jacob Murphy (Newcastle): If I'm being totally honest, I never thought I'd do a Team of the Week where we'd be talking about Jacob Murphy. That's probably the best compliment I can give him, he's playing that well I have to put him in. Two goals at the weekend, excellent performance. Alexander Isak (Newcastle): The best striker in the Premier League at this moment in time. Yes I've said it and yes I stand by it. He's the complete striker. Unreal. Every time I watch him I keep thinking, how haven't Arsenal signed him? He's a really good player and finisher. He's a poacher but he's also such a silky player. You don't see many silky poachers.\n\nRuben Amorim (Manchester United): I'm not giving this for Manchester United's win, the winning is separate. I'm giving it for the Rashford and Garnacho decision. It was a huge tone-setter for what he is doing at Manchester United. At one point, with Manchester United losing, I thought he might have to back off that decision because all the chat if they'd have lost would have been about what if those two had played. But he gets the win and no-one is talking about it which is how it should be. Standards are set and he is saying this is what you've got to do and I see and hear everything. You have to make sure you're a Manchester United player with a high level of standard and application otherwise you won't be there.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

{"context": "Elliot Castro was 16 when he first conned someone out of their bank details\n\nElliot Castro was 16 and selling mobile phones from a Glasgow call centre when he first conned someone out of their bank details. Soon he was enjoying a champagne lifestyle, that included first-class flights and luxury watches. The teenager would go on to mastermind the theft of £2.5m from an audacious series of scams before finally being brought to justice in a department store toilet in Edinburgh. Castro, who now works as a fraud prevention expert, shared his remarkable story in a new BBC Scotland documentary, Confessions of a Teenager Fraudster. It chronicles his rapid rise from leaving school with no qualifications to spending $1,000 (£786) on a bottle of champagne for friends in a New York bar. Castro, now 42, recalls the first time he conned a customer after they called in with an order. Instead of putting the order through as normal he pretended there was a problem with the credit card and then proceeded to dupe them into thinking he had their bank on the line. Seconds later he had their details and a scam was born. He recalled: \"I don't remember having that Eureka moment, if you like. \"It was just something that I did one time and I thought 'I wonder if I can do this?'\"\n\nCastro told the documentary he bought a £300 belt in Gucci in Bond St, London\n\nCastro's spending was modest to begin with but, like his offending, it rapidly escalated. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Mornings programme: \"That was the beginning of five years of absolute craziness from the time I was 16 up until 21, 22. \"The first time I ever got hold of a card it was CDs and haircuts and T-shirts at that point. \"There was no hint of how mental it would get later on.\" The fraudster was born in Aberdeen in 1982 and attended eight different schools before he moved to Glasgow with his family in 1998. He described himself as a dreamer and admitted lying on the application for his call centre job and said he was 18 instead of 16. Castro, who is half Chilean, said: \"I had it in my head that I would just have this amazing lifestyle.\" During one trip to London in 1999 Castro bought a Gucci belt for £300 - which he said was more than he earned in a week in the call centre. The Home Alone fan later splashed more than £8,000 on a first-class flight to New York, where he stayed in the Plaza Hotel, which features in the celebrated movie. His trip featured a three-day $15,000 (£11,791) spending spree on the city's exclusive Fifth Avenue.\n\nCastro now works with financial institutions, travel companies and businesses to combat fraud\n\nCastro admitted: \"A general day in my life at that time was wake-up, go shopping, buy things, go drinking, go back to whatever hotel I was staying in that night, sleep, wake up the next day and repeat. \"But all of this time I had to be aware that I was possibly being followed or that someone would be looking to catch me.\" In 2001 he enjoyed trips to Germany, France and Spain. The following year he spent time in Ireland, where he stayed at The Clarence Hotel in Dublin and claimed he rubbed shoulders with U2 stars. Castro said: \"It's a hotel owned by Bono and the Edge and we had a conversation one night in the bar where I told them I was working for the Ministry of Defence or a hotel consultant.\" The con man had several brushes with the law, dating back to 2001 when he spent four months in a young offenders' institute in Lancaster. Months later he was arrested at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh and taken to Manchester, where he was sentenced to 18 months at HMP Hindley. During this time he got a job in the prison library and read up about the internet. This research led him to use internet cafes on his release to make anonymous flight bookings with stolen credit cards. In 2002 he was arrested in Toronto and jailed for 87 days before being deported in 2003.\n\nHis international crime spree eventually came to an end in the Harvey Nichols department store in Edinburgh the following year. Castro said: \"I was beginning to feel done with it, I'd started for the first time in my life to make friends. \"But the downside was I couldn't tell them who I really was. \"So I do wonder, was there a subconscious part of me that wanted to give it up?\" That day he bought £2,000 of vouchers with a card that wasn't in his name.

He said: \"They got in touch with the real card holder who verified it was fraudulent and stupidly I came back to the shop less than an hour later and that's the moment it ended. \"I went to the toilet quickly and when I opened the cubicle door there was a plain clothes police officer there and that was the beginning of the end.\" The following year at Isleworth Crown Court in Middlesex, Castro admitted fraud offences amounting to more than £73,000 and was sentenced to two years.\n\nCastro admits he benefited from a lack of co-operation between law enforcement agencies and card companies. He said: \"Through the five years, if they'd had better communication then they might have managed to stop me quicker.\" Today he is a different man, full of regret over the misery he caused and keen not to glamourise theft. He is also helping to stop sophisticated scams and catch credit card fraudsters. Castro said: \"When I started doing this I never actually thought of people. \"I never met these people. That doesn't make it right. \"What I understood about the way credit cards worked at the time was that if the cardholder hadn't authorised the transactions - which in my case they didn't - then they wouldn't lose anything financially.\" More than 20 years on, he feels he is making amends for his actions as a teenager and a young man. He said: \"I'm not making excuses, but it is a very, very long time ago and I like to think since then I've made reparations. \"Fortunately I'm in a position now that I'm working with financial institutions, travel companies and businesses. \"I'm fortunate and lucky to be known as a trusted advisor in the industry now, which is great. \"It's been an interesting journey.\" Confessions of a Teenage Fraudster is available on BBC iPlayer."}

{"context": "Migrants stranded for more than three years on the remote Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia have been brought to the UK. The Sri Lankan Tamils are permitted to remain in the country for six months, with financial support from the Foreign Office, according to documents seen by the BBC. Their journey to the UK marks the end of years of complex legal battles waged over thousands of miles over their ", "continuation": "fate, but their long-term future remains uncertain. Most of the group of around 60 migrants have been living in a makeshift camp on Diego Garcia - the site of a strategic UK-US military base - since October 2021, when they became the first people ever to file asylum claims there.\n\nOn Monday, a government spokesperson described the move as a \"one-off, due to the exceptional nature of these cases and in the interests of their welfare\". \"This government inherited a deeply troubling situation that remained unresolved under the last administration for years,\" the spokesperson said. Tessa Gregory of UK law firm Leigh Day, which represents some of the migrants, said it was the \"only sensible solution to end the humanitarian crisis\" on the island. \"This vulnerable group which includes 16 children have spent 38 months detained in the most squalid of conditions on Crown land... we hope our clients will now be able to seek safe haven and begin to rebuild their lives,\" she said. The BBC gained unprecedented access earlier this year to Diego Garcia and the migrant camp there, where the Tamils were housed in groups in military tents, some of which had leaks and rats nesting inside. During their time on the island, there were multiple hunger strikes and numerous incidents of self-harm and suicide attempts in response to the conditions, after which some people were transferred to Rwanda for medical treatment. There were also allegations of sexual assaults and harassment within the camp. Migrants have told the BBC it was like living in \"hell\".\n\nTamils have been housed in groups in military tents\n\nThose in Rwanda have also been brought to the UK, arriving on a flight on Tuesday morning. One told the BBC: \"I hope to turn a new page. I hope my health will improve and I will transform into a new person.\" Two men with criminal convictions and another under investigation remain on the island, the BBC understands. The Tamils’ arrival in the UK comes amid uncertainty over the future of the territory. The UK announced in October that it was ceding control of the Chagos Islands, of which Diego Garcia is part, to Mauritius. But the new Mauritian prime minister has said he has reservations over the deal, which was struck by his predecessor and has still to be signed, and has asked for an independent review. The deal is facing opposition from some politicians in the UK and allies of US President-elect Donald Trump. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has played down the criticism, describing it as a “good deal” for both Mauritius and the UK, and saying it addresses US concerns about the future of the Diego Garcia base. In recent years, the territory has been costing the UK tens of millions of pounds, with the bulk of this categorised under \"migrant costs\". Communications obtained by the BBC between Foreign Office officials in July warned that \"the costs are increasing and the latest forecast is that these will be £50m per annum\" if they were to remain there.\n\nDiego Garcia is part of the Chagos Islands\n\nIn letters sent to the Tamils on Friday from the Home Office, they were told they were being granted temporary entry clearance to the UK \"outside of the Immigration Rules\" to allow them to consider their \"long-term options\". It stressed that the offer did not \"constitute permanent settlement in the UK or recognition of refugee status by the UK government\", and said the group would not be permitted to work. The government says the Chagos Islands, known as the British Indian Ocean Territory (Biot), are \"constitutionally distinct\" from the UK, with the unusual status leading to the long legal dispute. Most of the Tamils have been awaiting final decisions on claims for international protection - which the United Nations says is akin to refugee status - or appealing against rejections. In total, eight have been granted international protection, meaning they cannot be returned to Sri Lanka, the BBC understands. Successive governments have previously said that bringing the Tamils to the UK would risk creating a \"backdoor migration route\". But the government said on Monday that arrangements had been made to ensure this did not happen, citing a deal to send future arrivals to St Helena - another UK territory some 5,000 miles away. \"Once a sovereignty agreement with Mauritius is fully in place they would then take responsibility for any future migrants,\" the spokesperson said."}
{"context": "43,000 troops killed in war with Russia, Zelensky says\n\nSome 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia's full-scale invasion began, Volodymyr Zelensky has said in a rare admission of the extent of the nation's casualties. In a post on social media, the Ukrainian president said 370,000 injuries had been reported, though this figure included soldiers who had been hurt more than once and some of the injuries were said to be minor. He also claimed that 198,000 Russian soldiers had been killed and a further 550,000 wounded. The BBC has not been able to verify either side's figures. While both Kyiv and Moscow have regularly published estimates of the other side's losses, they have been reluctant to detail their own.\n\nThe new figure marks a significant increase in Ukrainian deaths since the start of the year. The last time Zelensky gave an update on Ukraine's casualties was in February, when he put deaths at 31,000. The Ukrainian president is thought to have been compelled to make the admission after incoming US President-elect Donald Trump wrote on social media that Ukraine had \"ridiculously lost\" 400,000 soldiers, while close to 600,000 Russians had been killed or wounded. Trump did not state where these figures were from. The incoming president, who has long made clear he wants to bring an end to the war, said too many lives had been \"needlessly wasted\". Zelensky's estimates of Russian losses are similar to those provided by senior Western officials, who estimate Russia has suffered around 800,000 casualties, both killed and injured. The UK's defence ministry says Russia suffered 45,680 casualties in November alone - more than during any month since its full-scale invasion began in February 2022. According to the latest UK Defence Intelligence estimates, an average of 1,523 Russian soldiers are being killed and wounded every day. On 28 November, it says, Russia lost more than 2,000 men in a single day, the first time this has happened. Moscow disputes those figures. In a statement, the Kremlin claimed that Ukrainian losses were \"many times higher\" than Russian ones. Outside of Russia, the consensus is that Russian casualty figures are far higher than Ukraine's due to their \"meat grinder\" tactics. Recent developments in the war have only added to the number of dead. Russian forces continue to make incremental advances along the eastern front line, capturing and retaking about 2,350 sq km of territory (907 sq miles) in eastern Ukraine and in Russia's western Kursk region since the start of the year. Ukrainian forces maintain control over a small amount of Russian territory which was captured during a surprise offensive into Russia in August. The Russian defence ministry says more than 38,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed or wounded in Kursk alone - a number that cannot be verified.\n\nRussia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. Eight years later, it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and has occupied territory in the country's south and east. Zelensky mentioned Ukraine's war dead in a broader post about the prospects for an eventual end to the war. It follows talks in Paris on Saturday with French President Emmanuel Macron and Trump, who has sought to capitalise on views held by around a quarter of Americans that the US is providing too muc", "continuation": "h support to Ukraine. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine \"in a day\" - but has yet to specify how he intends to do so. In his post, Zelensky stressed that any peace deal had to be backed by effective international guarantees for his country's security. He said he told Macron and Trump that Kyiv needs an \"enduring peace\" which Moscow would not \"destroy in a few years\". Responding to Trump's call for an immediate ceasefire, the Kremlin said it was open to negotiations, but the conditions for a cessation of hostilities had been set by Russian President Vladimir Putin in June. His demands included Ukraine giving up more of its territory and abandoning ambitions to join Nato, which Kyiv has rejected."}

It follows a years-long investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use by Gaetz, who President-elect Donald Trump wanted to serve as the nation's top lawman. The committee also found evidence that Gaetz, 42, received gifts in excess of permissible amounts in connection to a 2018 trip to the Bahamas. The former lawmaker has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, saying he is the victim of a smear campaign. Amid the controversy, he withdrew from consideration to serve as US attorney general.\n\nThe congressional ethics report found that \"there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favours or privileges, and obstruction of Congress.\" From 2017 to 2020, Gaetz made payments totalling more than $90,000 (£72,000) to 12 different women \"that the Committee determined were likely in connection with sexual activity and/or drug use\", the report found. Additionally, the report contains testimony that Gaetz paid for sex with a 17-year-old at a party in 2017, giving her $400 \"which she understood to be payment for sex\". Gaetz has denied having sex with a minor. The Department of Justice also investigated an allegation that he had sex with a minor but ultimately did not file any criminal charges against him. In a last-minute court filing on Monday, Gaetz sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the report's release. He accused the ethics committee of trying to exercise its jurisdiction over a private citizen. The committee's 42-page report accuses Gaetz of being \"uncooperative\" throughout its review, and that he would frequently \"deflect, deter, or mislead\" the panel \"in order to prevent his actions from being exposed\". Despite a subpoena, he never appeared before the committee to testify. Gaetz represented Florida's first congressional district in the US House of Representatives, having come to power in the same election in 2016 that propelled his ally Trump to the White House the first time. Gaetz got married in 2021 to his current wife, Ginger, who has supported the former Florida congressman as he's faced the allegations. She posted a photo on X of her husband with the caption \"unemployment has never looked so good\" after he withdrew his name to serve as attorney general after resigning from Congress. Gaetz was believed to be beyond the reach of the committee when he resigned from Congress last month, following his nomination by Trump to serve as US attorney general - America's top law enforcement official who heads the Department of Justice. Trump picked Gaetz in part because he is an ultra-loyalist who had also pledged to take on the \"weaponised\" legal system that supporters believe targeted Trump. He has been one of Trump's most strident defenders on Capitol Hill. But many Republicans in Congress, including those tasked with voting on such nominations, were aghast at the choice and successfully challenged it. Gaetz dropped out just eight days after being nominated by Trump amid a groundswell of controversy. Trump then tapped former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi as his nominee for attorney general. Trump has not yet commented on the report's findings.\n\nWhile it is unusual for the committee to release its findings after a lawmaker leaves public office, the report noted that a \"majority\" of members found it was in the public interest to do so in this instance. An intense debate had erupted over whether or not the report should be released, particularly after Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration for the top justice department role. He said that he hoped to avoid a \"needlessly protracted Washington scuffle\". Gaetz's slated role as attorney general was one of those that required the confirmation of US senators, and it did not seem that he had the required support. The secretive ethics committee had investigated Gaetz on and off since 2021 - not only on the claims about sex and drugs, but also on allegations he accepted bribes and misused campaign funds. In all cases, he strongly denied any wrongdoing. House Republicans previously blocked Democratic efforts to unveil the r", "continuation": "esults of the report, but two of them later voted to do so, according to CBS. On Monday, Gaetz posted on X that the committee chose to release the report close to Christmas \"and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses\". Last week, he posted that the ethics committee planed to \"post a report online that I have no opportunity to debate or rebut as a former member of the body.\" He acknowledged in a previous post on X that his 30s was an era of \"working very hard - and playing hard too\". \"It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life,\" he wrote. \"I live a different life now.\" Several House Democrats criticised their former colleague and Trump for having chosen him as an ally. Rep Glenn Ivey, one of the five Democrats on the ethics committee, said the allegations against Gaetz show there's a pattern by Trump of not \"putting people in those positions who are really up to doing the job\". \"President-elect Trump should have thought twice before he nominated Matt Gaetz and some of the other nominations he's made, I think would bear reconsideration as well,\" he told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Since leaving Congress, Gaetz has signed a deal to become an anchor on One America News Network (OAN). He'll join the conservative news network in January. He has also started selling personalised video messages on the video platform Cameo.\n• None Four revelations from the House ethics report on Matt Gaetz"}

Having battled motor neurone disease (MND) since 2019, rugby league legend Burrow, an ex-England team-mate of Burgess, died at the age of 41 on Sunday. Warrington's Challenge Cup trophy match against Wigan is the second match of a triple-header at Wembley on Saturday, following the Women's Challenge Cup final and preceding the 1895 Cup final. \"Hopefully we can sell the place out and really celebrate the life of Rob Burrow,\" Burgess told BBC Sport. \"If you could pin down a week in the calendar - it's", "continuation": " fitting that it's on the big stage at Wembley. \"All [his] achievements, not just on the field but off the field, hopefully we can celebrate them in style with a smile on the face and remember him for what a special character he was. \"Hopefully everyone puts on a great performance. There's three great matches and [hopefully] we all do him justice.\"\n\nBurrow, an eight-time Super League winner with his only club, Leeds Rhinos, was one of the most successful rugby league players in history and was made an MBE in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to sport and the MND community. He was later made a CBE in the 2024 New Year Honours alongside his friend and former Leeds team-mate Kevin Sinfield for the sheer magnitude of their fundraising efforts. Undeterred by his diagnosis in late 2019, Burrow blazed a trail and helped to raise more than £15m for MND charities. Burgess is well aware of the impact the disease can have on a family. \"We all know the end result with motor neurone disease,\" the 35-year-old Burgess said. \"It doesn't really discriminate. It's really aggressive. We know as a family first-hand exactly what it's like. \"We lost our father [to MND] in 2007. It's a real pivotal time in your life when you're managing that as a family. \"No doubt Lindsey and Rob's beautiful three children are reflecting on that time for them as a family.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Rob Burrow was a shining light on and off the rugby field\n\nWigan captain Liam Farrell also played alongside Burrow for England and agrees with Burgess that the weekend offers an opportunity to pay tribute. Despite the sport losing a figurehead in Burrow, Farrell believes that his legacy will remain and a huge day at Wembley is the first opportunity for that to take hold. \"We've got an iconic week of rugby league coming up and we're talking about an iconic player,\" Farrell told BBC Radio Manchester. \"I've always said, playing against anyone on the field, I'd rather have the biggest player run at me than Rob Burrow. \"It's very sad news but also we will make sure we remember a legend this week.\" Sinfield, who Burrow first met when he was 12 years old, has completed several endurance challenges which have raised more than £7m and been featured in two BBC documentaries. \"He was so brave, so tough. I wish he could have seen the outpouring of love,\" Sinfield told BBC Sport. \"We all lose special people. But it's very rare you lose someone who's so special to so many different people. \"What's really important is that Rob Burrow continues to live forever and I'm sure the MND community, and everyone who's supported us previously, will make sure that Rob's name is at the forefront of everything we do going forward.\""}

{"context": "Europe’s centre left struggles to hold back surge from right\n\nSpain's Pedro Sánchez joined Italian centre-left leader Elly Schlein in Rome ahead of the campaign\n\n“The very soul of Europe is at risk,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez warned fellow European centre-left politicians who had gathered in Rome ahead of a difficult EU election campaign. At stake was how to halt the seemingly unstoppable rise of right-wing and far-right parties in the European Parliament vote, which starts on Thursday in the Netherlands and continues across all 27 EU member states until Sunday. Only four EU member states have centre-left or left-wing parties in government and recent performances at the ballot box have been poor. The omens for the coming days are not good. The European left is in “bad health”, says Prof Marc Lazar of Sciences Po in Paris and Rome’s Luiss University, the result of a steady decline that began in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The EU’s centre left makes up the second largest group in the outgoing European Parliament. Known as the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), they are projected, at best, to cling on to their 139 seats in the 720-seat parliament. It is Europe's parties on the right that have the wind in their sails, and any success the centre left achieves is likely be offset by losses elsewhere. In only four countries are the Socialists and Democrats projected to come out on top - in Sweden, Denmark, Lithuania and Malta. Even then, Denmark’s Social Democrats under Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen are geared up for a big drop in support. Hers is one of only four out of 27 member states with centre-left or left-wing parties at the helm. Spain, Germany, and Malta are the others.\n\nDenmark's Mette Frederiksen and Germany's Olaf Scholz are two of only a handful of centre-left European leaders\n\nSpain’s Socialists under Pedro Sánchez and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats are set to be leapfrogged by their conservative opponents - the Christian Democrats in Germany and the Popular Party (PP) in Spain. Mr Scholz’s party has been steadily losing support since it won the 2021 federal elections and it is now in a battle for second place with the far-right AfD party. Pedro Sánchez is in a better position because of a controversial amnesty deal he struck with pro-independence Catalan parties. But that has also opened him up to criticism from the PP and far-right Vox.\n\nFor some opposition parties on the left the situation could end up far worse, as they face being overtaken by the far right. Pawel Zerka, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, says centre-left parties have shifted in recent years away from traditional socialist ideas towards more liberal policies, so they are now “too similar” to the centre right, who are “equally pro-European, with similar positions on economic policies and climate”. Latest surveys suggest most Europeans consider poverty, public health, the economy and the EU's defence and security among their top concerns. And while the S&D’s manifesto promises to address these very issues, Prof Marc Lazar says for many voters it is too late, because the left failed to protect them when they had the chance.\n\nPro-European voters on the left have often felt alienated by anti-capitalist Eurosceptic Jean-Luc Mélenchon\n\nAs the left moved to the centre on socio-economic battles, the right and far right grew in strength, says Pawel Zerka. Cordons aimed at keeping the more extreme parties at bay then cemented the perception that they, rather than the left, were the real opposition to the centre. The left then started to champion issues like gender, LGBT rights or green policies: popular with urban young voters, less so with working-class families. \"In many European countries the centre left is now seen as the rich progressive elite of the cities,\" argues Mr Zerka.\n\nSome parties on the left have taken note, combining progressive and conservative policies. Denmark’s Social Democrats have taken a tough stance on migration, while Romania’s Social Democrats mix conservative values and Eurosceptic tendencies with centre-left economic policies. Migration has shaped and defined the European political debate over the past decade and many “old left” voters have looked elsewhere for solutions. France’s National Rally, under Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, has been more successful than most in attracting voters with its anti-migration platform. The RN is well ahead of any of its rivals in this election. A French study carried out shortly after France's 2022 elections showed that 42% of working-class men and women cast their vote for Marine Le Pen. One RN mayor said the left “forgot its fundamental principles when it supported minorities rather than workers – while we defended them”. Across the Alps, the Italian Democratic Party (PD) has struggled to find a coherent line to counter the anti-immigrant message of Giorgia Meloni’s far-right Brothers of Italy (FdI). It remains internally fragmented and in opposition, but should come second to FdI in these elections.\n\nRaphaël Glucksmann has shot up in the Fr", "continuation": "ench polls\n\nIt is not all bad news for the left. France's Socialists have a new champion in Raphaël Glucksmann, who has emerged as a moderate, pro-European leader out of the collapse of an alliance of left-wing parties in French elections two years ago. Moderates have long felt alienated by anti-capitalist Eurosceptic Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who for years has been the most prominent figure of the French left. An MEP since 2019, Mr Glucksmann has no hope of catching Jordan Bardella’s National Rally, but he is challenging for second place with the centrist Renew list backed by President Emmanuel Macron. Sweden’s Social Democratic Party is set to obtain 30% of the vote in June, and remains the largest party in Sweden, even though a centre-right coalition is in government. But these are slim pickings for a movement that once dominated the European scene. In the past 10 years the EU has gone through events that had the potential to strengthen the traditionally pro-European left – from Covid-19 to the war in Ukraine and the fight against climate change - once the importance of a joint European response became clear. So too, the current cost of living crisis could have been an opportunity for left-wing politicians to argue for stronger welfare measures. Part of the problem could be down to today’s leaders, commentators believe. Olaf Scholz has faced accusations of dithering on Ukraine, while the head of Italy’s centre left, Elly Schlein, has been criticised for being too divisive. “For a long time now, we haven't seen great left-wing leaders like Tony Blair, Gerhard Schröder or François Mitterrand,” argues Prof Lazar. “Now, when we think of leadership in Europe, we think of [Hungary's Viktor] Orban, [Italy’s Giorgia] Meloni, [France's Marine] Le Pen.” That is why Raphaël Glucksmann in France has attracted so much interest from voters in a relatively short time, and why he’s promising supporters to be the “great, big surprise” of this election."}

When she plays the final notes of Karma in Vancouver on Sunday night, the Eras Tour will be over, forever. First announced in November 2022, it's been even bigger than Swift could have wildest-dreamed - with 149 shows in 53 cities seen by 10.1 million fans. Along the way, it hoovered up $2bn in ticket sales, stimulated local economies and triggered seismic events. Swift has called it \"the most exhausting, all-encompassing, but most joyful, most rewarding, most wonderful thing that has ever happened\" in her life.\n• None End of an era as 'proud' Taylor Swift finishes tour Writing in her recently-published tour book, Swift said the 45-song, career-spanning setlist was inspired by the decision to re-record her first six albums, which made her fall \"back in love\" with her past work. She went on to play concerts in \"the pouring rain, in the blazing heat, in the thickest of humidity, in the wildest of winds and in the bitter cold,\" she wrote, even when she was \"sick or exhausted or injured,\" or working through a \"broken heart\".\n\nWe're bringing up Taylor Swift's history: from dizzying Grammy records to reaching billionaire status and everything in between.\n\nFans across the world have traded friendship bracelets and dressed as their favourite Taylor \"Era\" while attending the concerts\n\nBut the concerts were about more than the music. Fans swapped friendship bracelets and made lifelong friends with strangers. Outside the stadiums, ticketless Swifties gathered in car parks to sing along. At one show in Munich, 40,000 people congregated on a nearby hill just to catch a glimpse of the show, almost outnumbering the fans inside the city's former Olympic Stadium. For many, the chance to hear these songs live for the first time was overwhelming. \"I did a lot more weeping than I expected,\" says Chvrches singer Lauren Mayberry, who first saw the tour in Santa Clara last year. \"I wept at the start, just because it was exciting. Obviously I wept during [epic break-up ballad] All Too Well. Then I cried in The Archer. Don't know why.\"\n\nAhead of the final three shows, Swift has played all but six songs from her vast catalogue of more than 270 tracks\n\nOnline, the faithful watched nightly livestreams and downloaded a free, fan-run app - SwiftAlert, external - that allowed them to speculate on the outfits Swift might wear, and the surprise songs she might play in her nightly acoustic set.

'She wants it more than anyone' Michelle, from Seattle, Washington, is attending one of the final concerts in Vancouver with her daughter this weekend, and says the anticipation has helped them stay in touch", "continuation": ". \"I got the tickets almost 13 months ago, and even though she doesn't live at home full time, I doubt even a week has gone by where we've not had a fun conversation about Taylor, and spoke about looking forward to the show, and what our plans for the weekend may entail,\" she says.\n\nThe conclusion of the tour leaves Swift at a crossroads. This Eras Tour will be the yardstick against which the rest of her career will be measured - and her next move will be watched closely by fans and critics alike. So what options does she have? \"Taylor is a very future-minded thinker, so I imagine she has the next few years already completely planned out.\" says Bryan West, a dedicated Taylor Swift reporter for USA Today and The Tennessean, who has seen the Eras tour 89 times. Noting Swift's tendency to dovetail her projects, he thinks there will be some sort of \"news-making\" announcement at her final show. Most likely, this will be the reveal of Reputation (Taylor's Version) - the latest instalment of her re-recorded album series, complete with bonus tracks from the vault. That said, fans have been anticipating that announcement all year and the album is yet to materialise, despite numerous, external, tantalising, external hints, external it's on its way. West has some other theories, too. \"We've seen film crews at many of the gigs, so I'd not be shocked if she's been shooting a documentary this entire time. \"And in her new book, she said, 'See you next era', so there have been reports that she's working on new music.\"\n\nSwift's boyfriend, Travis Kelce (right), made a surprise on-stage appearance during one of her eight record-breaking shows in London's Wembley Stadium\n\nA longer term prospect is that Swift will pivot to film. In December 2022, she signed a deal to direct a film for Searchlight Pictures, based on her own original script. Making the announcement, Searchlight presidents David Greenbaum and Matthew Greenfield called her \"a once in a generation artist and storyteller\", but the trail has gone cold since then. Perhaps she'll return to the director's chair in 2025? West has also tracked several trademarks filed by the star this year, including Taylor-Con and Female Rage: The Musical \"which could be anything from a television show to a documentary series to a Broadway production\". But maybe we're expecting too much?\n\n\"She needs to take some time off, first and foremost,\" says Jack Saunders, host of Radio 1's New Music Show, \"because it's completely unrealistic to expect a human being to operate at the performance level that she has been doing for the last couple of years and dive straight back in. \"We've heard a lot from Taylor - so it's healthy for us and it's healthy for her to step back and take some time away, so that she can fuel herself for whatever's next.\" Indeed, Swift has hinted she's tiring of the music industry grind. Clara Bow, a track from her latest album The Tortured Poets Department, is a barbed commentary on the industry's lust for new blood. Other songs find her daydreaming about wedding rings and \"pushin' strollers\" - so there's every possibility Swift will take a year off to focus on her romance with American football star Travis Kelce. \"She probably will take a break,\" says West, \"but she's not one that necessarily sits still. She's always creating. She's always coming up with new projects.\" If Swift does head back to the studio, singer-songwriter Self Esteem hopes she'll spend the cultural (and financial) capital she's built up over the last two years to do something unexpected. \"If I was her, I'd indulge myself in making music in all the different genres and styles I hadn't been able to explore because of branding and expectations,\" she says. \"And it sounds really worthy, but I can't wait until I have enough money to fund working class people who can't get access to music - so if I was her, I'd do that.\" (It's worth noting that Swift has a history of charitable giving, including donations to local foodbanks on every stop of the Eras tour).\n\nThe tour has already been released on film, but fans are hoping for a director's cut, featuring new material that was added to the setlist in 2024\n\nWhatever happens, a left-hand swerve makes sense; in her Eras Tour book, the star says she \"hates to do the same thing twice\". But for this weekend, Michelle just wants to savour the final moments of a one-off phenomenon. \"We love concerts in my family. I love the buzz of being in a whole crowd of people excited about the same thing,\" she says, \"but this feels different. \"I love how the tour has brought people all over the world together. \"It will certainly be interesting to see what her next move is,\" she adds, \"but I can't bring myself to speculate. \"I'll just wait and see - because, whatever she does next, Taylor and her team should be very proud of the joy that was brought to so many during the Eras Tour run.\""}

'It makes me hurt and it makes me angry' - Sunak on Reform racism row\n\nConservative leader Rishi Sunak said he was \"hurt\" and \"angry\" after a Reform UK canvasser used a racist term to describe him. Secret recordings published by Channel 4 show a canvasser working to get Reform UK leader Nigel Farage elected as MP for Clacton using a racial slur to refer to the prime minister - who is of Indian origin. Reform UK said those making \"unacceptable comments\" will no longer be part of Mr Farage's campaign. Speaking to reporters, Mr Sunak said \"my two daughters have to see and hear Reform people who campaigned for Nigel Farage\" using racist language against him. \"It hurts. And it makes me angry,\" he said. Mr Farage \"has some questions to answer,\" he added. \"When you see Reform candidates and campaigners, seemingly using racist and misogynistic language and opinions seemingly without challenge, I think it tells you something about the culture within the Reform Party.\" In responding to the comments, Mr Sunak chose to repeat the racist term, saying: “I do it deliberately and I hate having to do it. \"I chose my words deliberately and I hate having to repeat them, absolutely hate it but I also think it’s important to call this out for what it is and be clear about what it is.\"\n\nEssex Police have confirmed they are \"urgently assessing\" comments made by Reform campaigners in Channel 4's footage \"to establish if there are any criminal offences\". Footage broadcast by Channel 4 shows racist and Islamophobic slurs apparently being made by Andrew Parker, identified as a canvasser for Mr Farage. Mr Parker tells an undercover reporter he has \"always been a Tory voter\" but he is \"annoyed\" by Mr Sunak, who he referred to using a racial slur. Mr Parker is also heard describing Islam as \"the most disgusting cult out\" and suggesting army recruits should carry out “target practice” by shooting at small boats bringing illegal migrants to the UK. At one point Mr Parker tells voters Reform would be \"kicking all the Muslims out of the mosques and turning them into Wetherspoons\". During campaigning, he advises the undercover reporter to use the term \"illegal\" when discussing immigration, especially when addressing non-white households. Ahead of the publication of the footage, Mr Parker made a statement to Channel 4 claiming \"neither Nigel Farage personally or the Reform Party are aware of my personal views on immigration\". Mr Parker said: “I have never discussed immigration with either Nigel Farage or the Reform Party and that any comments made by me during those recordings are my own personal views on any subject I commented on. “I would therefore like to apologise profusely to Nigel Farage and the Reform Party if my personal views have reflected badly on them and brought them into disrepute as this was not my intention.\"\n\nT", "continuation": "his video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nMr Farage has claimed Channel 4's undercover filming was a \"total set up\", with Mr Parker a hired actor. He initially condemned the remarks as \"appalling\" and said anyone making \"reprehensible\" comments will \"no longer be with the campaign\". But speaking to the BBC, Mr Farage said Mr Parker's behaviour in the Channel 4 report did not \"ring true\". He said Mr Parker \"came out with an endless stream of invective\", adding \"no one speaks like that, it went on and on and on\". \"I looked at his website, I saw some videos, he's a very well-spoken actor.... but he does what he calls \"rough speaking\". From the moment he arrived in the office and he bowled up and spoke to me he was rough-speaking. He was acting from the moment he came into the office.\" Responding to Mr Farage's comments, Channel 4 News said: \"We strongly stand by our rigorous and duly impartial journalism which speaks for itself. “We met Mr Parker for the first time at Reform UK party headquarters, where he was a Reform party canvasser. \"We did not pay the Reform UK canvasser or anyone else in this report. Mr Parker was not known to Channel 4 News and was filmed covertly via the undercover operation.”\n\nMr Parker told the PA news agency that his comments were \"typical chaps-down-the-pub talk\". He said he made the remarks in the \"heat of the moment\" because he was being \"goaded on\" - and asked whether he would like to apologise, he says: “Of course I’m sorry. They were off-the-cuff things that everyone says.” He says he has “a lot of Pakistani friends” and “Muslim friends”, and that he is “sick to death” of being asked about the footage.\n\nThe secret recordings feature a conversation between what appears to be Reform UK organisers, including a man Channel 4 named as George Jones - longtime party activist who organises events for Mr Farage. In the footage Mr Jones calls a Pride flag on a police car as a \"degenerate flag\". He repeatedly suggests members of the LGBT+ community are paedophiles and criticises police attending Pride. He adds that, should Reform UK form a future government, “our police officers will be paramilitaries, they won’t be police” and should “bring back the noose”. Speaking to ITV's Loose Women, Mr Farage called the comments \"vulgar, drunk and wrong\" and claimed people in the group were \"gone\".

Greek Police said Mr Mosley left his wife on the beach and set off on a walk to the centre of the island on Wednesday. His phone was found in the place he was staying with his wife, who reported him missing, a police spokesperson told BBC News.

Unable to get answers from the Post Office, and warned she could lose her business, she began feeding money from her shop to the till to cover the apparent shortfalls.\n\nSeema borrowed large amounts of money from relatives to balance the books - including £22,000 from her sister-in-law.\n\nShe says she felt like \"the dumbest person on the planet\".\n\n\"They say they have so many other post offices who are doing fine, 'it's you having an issue'. I used to be on the floor until the early hours of the morning trying to find out what went wrong, but [I] couldn't find it.\"\n\nShe was one of 736 people who were prosecuted between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon computer accounting system - an average of one a week. A further 283 cases were brought by other bodies, including the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nSeema was given a 15-month prison sentence in 2010. She was sent to Bronzefield Prison on the day of her son's 10th birthday and ordered to pay compensation totalling £40,000.\n\nHer husband, Davinder, lied to family members - including Seema's parents in India - and did not reveal she was prison.\n\nHe made excuses for her missing phone calls, sometimes holding up a landline to his mobile so Seema could talk to her parents from prison without them knowing.\n\n\"If I [wasn't] pregnant I would have killed myself,\" she says. \"It was really bad, I never thought I was going to come out alive from there.\" Released early due to her good behaviour, Seema gave birth to her second son wearing an electronic tag.\n\nIn total, 236 postmaster and postmistresses have been sent to prison. To date, 95 convictions have been overturned. Seema's conviction is one of them.\n\nShe was one of the 39 sub-postmasters celebrating at the Court of Appeal on a spring day in April 2021.\n\n\"Each and every happy moment of my life since 2005, the Post Office ruined,\" Seema says. She is still waiting for compensation and has \"no idea what it will be\".\n\nPeter Holmes died from a brain tumour aged 74, in 2015. Six years later, his conviction was overturned at the Court of Appeal.\n\nHe is not the only person to have died without justice. Alan Bates estimates 60 or 70 people have died in the intervening years. Some ended their own lives.\n\nPeter's widow, Marion, who he was married to for 51 years, says her late husband's reputation was \"destroyed\" by the Post Office.\n\nPeter had been a manager at a post office in Jesmond, a suburb of Newcastle upon Tyne. He was a former police constable. He had grown up in Jesmond and was based there while in the police. Peter was well-known and highly-respected in the community.\n\nLike the others, he began seeing shortfalls in his Horizon system and used his own money to balance the sums. But the amounts became too large for him to cover.\n\nAfter the Post Office audited his accounts, Peter was accused of stealing £46,000 and was suspended from work in 2008.\n\nHe kept telling Marion not to worry, but she says she \"knew something was wrong\". For weeks she would hear Peter being sick as he got ready in the morning. He told Marion he had just been coughing.\n\nWhile under investigation, he began working as a casual delivery driver for a florist, but quit because he felt he couldn't tell his new employers he was being prosecuted.\n\nHe was convicted in January 2010 and sentenced to a community order with a curfew for three months - lasting from 7pm to 7am every day. The local newspaper ran a story with Peter's picture on", "continuation": " the front page.\n\n\"I think that destroyed him more than anything else,\" says Marion. \"The last person on earth who would have cheated anyone or pinched money was Peter.\"\n\nShe says he rarely went out after that, even when his curfew ended. He considered volunteering for a charity, transporting cancer patients to hospital, but decided not to after he found out they would carry out a background check.\n\nFollowing his conviction, Peter learned of the plight of other sub-postmasters.\n\nHe contacted Alan Bates and, shortly before his health deteriorated, Peter appealed against his conviction. Before he died, a decision was made to review his case.\n\nIn April 2021, Marion travelled to the Royal Courts of Justice in London, with her son to hear her late husband's conviction being overturned. Like Seema, Peter was one of 39 former postmasters who had their convictions quashed that day.\n\n\"It was a funny feeling,\" Marion says. \"It was really a bit bittersweet.\"\n\n\"When I meet Peter at the end of that rainbow I want to be able to tell him everybody got the justice they deserved - that's the good, bad and ugly.\"\n\nAnjana and Baljit Sethi ran two post offices near Romford, in Essex, where they raised their three children. Anjana had grown up in a post office. Her dad was a sub-postmaster. The family were experienced at their jobs.\n\nWith business going well, they were encouraged by the Post Office to take on a second branch. So in 2001, they took out a £120,000 loan to buy and start up the new shop.\n\nBut things soon began going wrong. The Horizon computer system began showing shortfalls, which grew to £17,000.\n\nUnable to afford to cover the difference, the Sethis closed the new branch. They were left financially ruined. The couple's son, Adeep, 38, says family life has been a struggle for his parents ever since.\n\nAlthough Baljit has given evidence to the ongoing public inquiry, Adeep says his father still finds it hard to talk about what happened to the family.\n\n\"There's a reason I do media - he cannot talk about it without breaking down. He goes straight to anger, straight to emotion, he cannot control it. It has emotionally broken him.\"\n\nMuch like the Sethi family, Shazia Saddiq used to run multiple post offices in her home city of Newcastle. She lived above a shop in Ryton with her two young children.\n\nBut in October 2016, she was told around £40,000 was missing from one of her shops. She printed out receipts as long \"as toilet rolls\" to try to understand what had gone wrong.\n\nThe 40-year-old wasn't eventually prosecuted, but her shops were shut down. And people in the area assumed she was a thief.\n\nOne day she had eggs and flour thrown at her in the street while her two children were getting out of a car outside their home. She still wonders who it was.\n\nThat night, Shazia decided to pack up her home and leave the area. The family now live in Banbury, in Oxfordshire.\n\n\"It's been awful,\" Shazia says. \"I have been carrying this forever.\"\n\nCustomers at Jo Hamilton's post office could buy a slice of cake from the attached cafe before purchasing their stamps. Her story is one of the central themes of the ITV drama.\n\nIn one emotional scene, a panic-stricken Jo begins trying to balance the books after a long day. The Horizon software shows losses doubling in front of her eyes, yet her concerns are dismissed by a helpline operator.\n\nJo demands a visit from the Post Office area manager. She is told she is \"the only one having problems\". Jo had to remortgage her home to pay the debts and borrowed from friends in an attempt to cover the amount she thought she owed.\n\nProsecuted for a shortfall of £36,000 in 2006, she was persuaded to plead guilty to a charge of false accounting. \"I felt I had no choice because I was terrified of going to prison,\" she says.\n\nHer life was turned upside down. She was forced to give up her shop and found it difficult to get a new job due to her criminal record. She made ends meet by doing cleaning jobs for people in her village who didn't believe she was guilty.\n\nHer conviction was eventually quashed in 2021. She has received some financial redress for her ordeal, describing it as a \"good chunk\" of money. \"My husband was diagnosed with cancer last year and thank goodness we've got a little bit of money so that we can pay for his treatment.\n\n\"I feel lucky I was criminalised because I've had some chance at compensation. It's just scandalous. A lot of people have lost a whole pile of money - houses, businesses, marriages - the lot.\"\n\nBut she is still searching for answers. \"I would love to find out why this has all happened - how far up the chain does it go? Were people doing what they were told or were they doing it because they were bad? That's what's important to me because I still don't understand it.\"\n\nJo is one of just 30 victims of the scandal who have agreed final settlements - meaning most are yet to receive a penny for the trauma they have been through.\n\nITV's drama has thrust the stories of the wronged sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses into the limelight, most of whom are still waiting for redress.\n\nThe Sethi family are still waiting for final compensation after more than 20 years. Adeep says some of the offers from the Post Office have been \"insulting\".\n\nHe is pleased the issue is back in the spotlight, but says it feels like they are still fighting the Post Office. \"Even now you're treated like you're not an honest person,\" he says.\n\nThe Horizon scandal has been in his parents' lives for 20 years. \"All they want is for final compensation and to never think about the Post Office again.\"\n\nIt is estimated more than 4,000 people have been told they are eligible for compensation across three separate schemes. But how many of those will be able to fully recover the losses they've endured?\n\nOne thing is certain - the sub-postmasters and postmistresses are no longer alone.\n\nJo Hamilton says she has now \"moved on with my life\". But she is still part of the group battling for justice. \"I can't stop fighting until everyone gets their money,\" she says.\n\n\"The priority is to get the money that people are actually owed,\" says Alan Bates. \"Get it out to them as soon as possible. They can't get on with their lives, or what is left of them.\"\n\n\"It has gone on for far too long,\" he told the inquiry into the scandal this week. \"People are suffering, they are dying.\"\n\nProduction and design by Kady Wardell, Zoe Bartholomew and Lilly Huynh\n\nHave you been personally affected by the Post Office scandal?

{"context": "Elizabeth Harries wishes she could spend more time with animals and not doing paperwork\n\nA lack of veterinary surgeons could have a seriously negative effect on animal health, according to Welsh vets. Figures provided by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) show the number of vets has increased in Wales over the past 10 years - from just over 1,000 in 2014 to 1,488 in 2024. But according to the British Veterinary Association, these figures do not take into account the significant increase in pet ownership, especially during and since the pandemic. They also say an increase in paperwork and checks that vets have to complete because of Brexit means they have less time to treat animals.\n\nTo put the increased burden into perspective, more than three million homes in the UK welcomed new pets during the pandemic, often because of social isolation. This took the total number to more than 17 million. \"Like most people, I thought I'd be out and about doing all the fun things, but unfortunately there's a lot of paperwork and that has increased. \"We have to reco", "continuation": "rd all of our visits, our medications use, batch numbers.

Such visits allow her to check on the cattle, with the relationship she forms with their owner crucial to keeping them healthy. She believes if the visits decrease, the animals would suffer, adding: \"We're in a situation, where if we can't provide a service 24/7, it's going to have a real negative impact on animal health and welfare. \"Long term, if it carries on as now, then I don't think it is sustainable. I think the consequence on the health and welfare of animals could be absolutely huge.\" She believes it is vital enough staff are found to keep the service 24/7 for the agricultural sector. Ffion Rees, who farms at Blaenffynnon, agrees, saying: \"We don't want to see animals in pain. \"When we call the vet, we really do need them. \"We need a vet all day, and all night. So, yeah, it's really important.\"\n\nElizabeth Harries has called for more to be done to keep veterinary services 24/7 for the agricultural industry\n\nA number of vets told BBC Wales they had seen an increase in their workload, and according to the BVA it is a situation being seen across Wales and the UK, especially in rural areas. The Welsh government said it was clear that there was a need to keep veterinary capacity and capability under review, and that it is aware of the challenges. A veterinary school in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion is continuing to grow, it added, and \"plays an important role to encourage our vets of the future to study and practice veterinary medicine in Wales\". The UK government said it was working with key stakeholders to address shortages in the profession. This includes resetting the UK's relationship with Europe and seeking a new veterinary agreement, whilst also providing high-quality veterinary education within the UK."}

Watch: Starmer says Sunak originally was against Rwanda plan\n\nIn reply, the prime minister said the government would deliver on its promise to halt migrants crossing the Channel in small boats.\n\nMr Sunak said Labour had not put forward a \"single practical idea\" to reduce illegal migration, and \"can never be trusted to stop the boats\".\n\nThe government introduced the bill last month, after its plan to send asylum seekers to the east African country was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe legislation seeks to declare in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country to send refugees to - thereby stopping flights being grounded on legal grounds.\n\nMinisters could ignore emergency orders from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to suspend a flight to Rwanda while an individual legal case was being heard.\n\nBut rebels insist it will still allow the policy to be derailed by a wave of individual appeals, and want to tighten the circumstances in which they would be allowed.\n\nThey also want to make it the default position that ministers would ignore injunctions from the ECHR blocking flights.\n\nThe amendments are destined to fail at the vote next Tuesday as they will struggle to attract the required support from Labour MPs to overturn the government's majority.\n\nHowever, the rebels could put the government's bill in jeopardy if they vote it down at a later stage if it remains unamended.\n\nA group of 29 MPs would be big enough to overturn Mr Sunak's 56-seat majority, if they were to vote with Labour, which opposes the Rwanda policy.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Jenrick did not rule out voting the whole bill down if their proposed changes were not successful.\n\nHowever, he added he was \"not looking ahead to that\" and the rebel", "continuation": "s were hoping to \"win the argument\".\n\nHe said the current version of the bill was \"guaranteed to fail\" because it would not provide a \"sustainable deterrent\" to people crossing the Channel to claim asylum.\n\nHe added that appeals to deportations should only be allowed in a limited number of cases, such as for women who are pregnant and those unfit to fly.\n\nTory rebels had threatened to vote against the bill before Christmas - but in the end they only abstained, meaning passed its initial parliamentary stage fairly comfortably.\n\nMinisters could make concessions to the rebels in order to win them round, but it is thought this is unlikely to happen until the bill reaches its final stages in Parliament.\n\nAnd the government is also facing pressure from Tory MPs on the more liberal One Nation wing of the party, who insist the bill cannot be tightened further without breaching international law.\n\nThe Rwandan government has also threatened to pull out of the scheme if it does not comply with international obligations.\n\nDowning Street said Mr Sunak would consider amendments put forward by Tory MPs, and \"engagements\" were taking place with backbenchers.\n\nHowever, his spokesperson told reporters the government would not accept any changes that could \"jeopardise\" the UK's deal with Rwanda.\n\n\"We need a bill with a respectable legal argument and one which does not collapse the scheme,\" they added."}

The unnamed 23-year-old juror reported that she had received a gift bag filled with cash in the closing days of the federal criminal trial in Minneapolis. \"This is stuff that happens in mob movies,\" Assistant US Attorney Joseph Thompson said earlier this month after the alleged scheme emerged. Prosecutors have charged 70 people with stealing $250m from federal food programmes during the Covid-19 pandemic. Among the five charged with bribery are three who stood trial for providing fake names of non-existent children they were claiming to feed and creating a fraudulent paper trail in order to pocket millions of dollars. Abdiaziz Shafii Farah, Abdimajid Mohamed Nur, Said Shafii Farah, Abdulkarim Shafii Farah and Ladan Mohamed Ali have been charged with conspiracy to bribe a juror, bribery of a juror and corruptly influencing a juror. At a news conference on Wednesday, US Attorney Andrew Luger called the alleged bribery attempt a \"chilling attack on our justice system\", adding that he was grateful the juror \"could not be bought\". Prosecutors say the group targeted the woman because she was the youngest on the panel and \"they believed her to be the only juror of colour\".\n\nProsecutors say the money was delivered in a Hallmark gift bag\n\nThe juror was part of a trial over the theft of more than $40m by workers from Feeding Our Future, a now-defunct charity that recieved money from a federal food-aid programme meant to feed hungry children. Earlier this month, the jury convicted five of the defendants in the embezzlement case, but acquitted two others. Abdiaziz Shafii Farah, Abdimajid Mohamed Nur, Said Shafii Farah had wanted the juror to convince the rest of the panel that prosecutors were racist so they would acquit the defendants, according to Mr Luger. The prosecutor said the suspects devised an instruction manual for nobbling the jury under which they would be told: “We are immigrants.

Watch: The BBC's Rayhan Demytrie sees \"anger and frustration\" on streets of Tbilisi\n\nA former Manchester City footballer has been appointed president by Georgia's disputed parliament, after 17 days of pro-EU protests that have swept this country's towns and cities. Mikheil Kavelashvili, now 53, is a former MP from the increasingly authoritarian ruling Georgian Dream party and was the only candidate for the job. On Saturday, 224 out of 225 members of Georgia's electoral college voted for him. The four main opposition groups have rejected Kavelashvili and have boycotted parliament, insisting that the elections held in October were rigged. Large crowds of protesters, facing freezing temperatures, gathered outside parliament from the early hours of Saturday morning ahead of the vote. Georgia's outgoing pro-Western president, Salome Zourabichvili, has condemned Kavelashvili's election as a travesty, insisting she holds Georgia's only remaining legitimate institution.\n\nMikheil Kavelashvili reacts to the vote in parliament\n\nPrime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has accused Zourabichvili of trying to harm Georgia's interests, emphasising that when her term of office ends on 29 December, she will have to retire. \"We have very strong state institutions, so we certainly have no difficulty in bringing the situation under full control,\" he was quoted as saying on Friday. Party colleague Nino Tsilosani told reporters that Zourabichvili was no longer president in the eyes of the public. Georgia is a parliamentary democracy with the president the head of state, and the prime minister the head of Parliament.\n\nProtests against Georgian Dream began immediately after the October elections but they burst into life on 28 November when the government announced it was putting EU accession negotiations on hold until 2028. An overwhelming majority of Georgians back the country's path to the European Union and it is part of the constitution. Every night, the main avenue outside parliament fills with protesters draped in EU flags, demanding new elections. The night before the vote, the capital Tbilisi was convulsed by pop-up protests involving IT specialists, public sector workers, creative industry professionals, actors and lawyers. \"We are standing here to create a legal state once and for all, to respect the provisions of the constitution and human rights,\" said lawyer Davit Kikaleishvili, 47.\n\nOf course, the government will elect an illegitimate president, but this will not change anything. The parliament is also illegitimate.\n\nKavelashvili is a founder of the People's Power party, known for being the main voice for anti-Western propaganda in Georgia. He has accused opposition parties of acting as a \"fifth column\" directed from abroad, and described President Zourabichvili as a \"chief agent\". Kavelashvili moved into politics after he was disqualified from seeking the leadership of the Georgian football federation because he lacked the qualifications. Although his party ran alongside Georgian Dream in the October elections, it has now decided to act in parliament as a \"healthy opposition\", to fill the place of the \"so-called radical opposition funded by foreign forces\". A People's Power party MP, Guram Macharashvili, who announced on 13 December that his faction would leave the ruling parliamentary majority, told the ", "continuation": "BBC that what was happening in the country was an \"artificially created crisis characterised by the influence of foreign powers\". Macharashvili and Kavelashvili are the architects of Georgia's controversial \"foreign agents\" law, seen by the country's opposition as Russian-style legislation. When asked what \"healthy opposition\" means, Macharashvili said: \"Opposition does not necessarily mean opposition on all issues, it does not mean only cooperation with foreigners. It means competition with the ruling party to make better proposals on what's best for Georgia's future.\"\n\nGeorgian Dream, founded by billionaire businessman and former Georgian PM Bidzina Ivanishvili, has been accused of dragging the country back into Russia's sphere of influence.

{"context": "King praises health workers and calls for unity after riots\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: King Charles speaks of \"pride\" at unity shown after riots\n\nKing Charles has delivered a personal message of gratitude to health workers who have supported him during his cancer treatment, in his annual Christmas speech. In a candid message, he offered his \"heartfelt thanks\" to the doctors and nurses who helped with the \"uncertainties and anxieties of illness\". The King also praised the efforts of those building links between different communities in what he called the \"anger and lawlessness\" of the summer riots. Diversity in ethnicity and faith is a sign of \"strength, not weakness\", said the King's message.\n\nThis year's Christmas broadcast was delivered in the Fitzrovia Chapel in London, the first time a venue outside a royal residence had been used for over a decade. It had been the former chapel of the Middlesex Hospital, reflecting the theme of paying respect to those working in the health services. \"All of us go through some form of suffering at some stage in our life, be it mental or physical,\" said the King, but the \"measure of our civilisation\" is how people are supported at such moments. The King's message, recorded earlier this month, expressed his gratitude for \"selfless\" medical professionals and volunteers who used their skills to \"care for others - often at some cost to themselves\". He acknowledged the help for others in his family, with the Princess of Wales receiving a cancer diagnosis this year. And he thanked the public for their kind words and messages, after his own cancer diagnosis was revealed in February. The broadcast showed him meeting cancer patients, when he returned to public engagements in April, during a visit to University College London Hospital. The King's treatment will continue into 2025, but as a positive sign of progress, he is planning a busy schedule of visits and overseas trips next year.\n\nThe Fitzrovia Chapel was chosen for its links to the healthcare professions\n\nAnother major theme of the speech was a focus on community cohesion. The King praised the efforts of those who had sought to build bridges between communities after the summer riots, that had followed the knife attack in Southport. \"I felt a deep sense of pride here in the United Kingdom when, in response to anger and lawlessness in several towns this summer, communities came together, not to repeat these behaviours, but to repair. To repair not just buildings, but relationships,\" said the King. \"Diversity of culture, ethnicity and faith provides strength, not weakness,\" said the King, who praised efforts to \"respect our differences, to defeat prejudice\". The King's words echo the Christmas message given by his mother the late Queen Elizabeth in 2004, when she addressed community tensions, saying \"diversity is indeed a strength and not a threat\". In a speech earlier this year on Commonwealth Day, the King had also stressed the same message that \"diversity is our greatest strength\". The Christmas broadcast included pictures of Prince William and Catherine thanking emergency workers who responded to the Southport knife attack, in a visit which", "continuation": " had included a meeting with bereaved families. Accompanying the speech a community choir sang the carol Once in Royal David's City. And a Christmas tree seen in the broadcast has since been donated to a hospice in Clapham. There were words of sympathy from the King for those at risk in wars around the world, with conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The King commended the \"remarkable veterans of that very special generation\" as he recalled the 80th anniversary commemorations of the D-Day landings. The broadcast followed the convention of showing working royals, so there were no sightings of either Prince Harry or Prince Andrew. King Charles is spending Christmas Day in Sandringham in Norfolk. Crowds gathered in the morning to watch him going to a church service with his family, including Queen Camilla and the Prince and Princess of Wales."}

{"context": "Fernando Alonso is ninth in this year's drivers' championship\n\nAston Martin driver Fernando Alonso was fastest in Friday practice at the Canadian Grand Prix on a day disrupted by intermittent rain. Alonso’s best time, which put him 0.463 seconds ahead of Mercedes’ George Russell in second, came at the driest point of the second session before more rain fell in Montreal. The first session, in which McLaren’s Lando Norris was fastest, was also rain-affected, so the headline lap times of the day were almost entirely meaningless. But there were obvious problems for championship leader Max Verstappen. The Red Bull driver, who was 18th fastest in the second session, pitted after just four laps with smoke pouring from the back of his car. Red Bull said his car had suffered a problem with the energy recovery system. Verstappen said: “It’s not ideal, I would have liked to drive more laps. So it’s definitely not how I would have liked to get on in P2. “But it is more important to figure out what happened and what implications it will have on the weekend and the rest of the year.” Wet weather was the theme of the day. At one stage, before practice started, organisers closed the Ile-Notre Dame, the man-made island in the St Lawrence Seaway that hosts the track, because of a heavy storm. The first session started on time but the cars were unable to go out as the pit lane was not opened while marshals tried to dry the track.\n\nWhen it did get under way, it progressively dried to the point that the drivers were able to run slick tyres for the final five minutes of the session. Norris set the pace by 0.328secs from the Ferraris of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc. In the second session, Alonso ran consistently at the front as the track had a brief dry period for 15 minutes or so at the start before rain started again. The two-time champion said: “A tricky Friday for everyone. Not many laps in either session. “No proper laps in dry conditions or in wet conditions, but it could be like this in qualifying and race. We need to be sharp tomorrow.” Behind Alonso and Russell, the Spaniard’s team-mate Lance Stroll was third fastest, from Leclerc, RB’s Daniel Ricciardo, Haas driver Kevin Magnussen and Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes. Hamilton, who with Michael Schumacher is the equal most successful driver in Montreal with seven wins, said: “It felt great. I was just raring to go every second. This is a track where it’s building blocks, about getting as much time in the car and understanding both conditions and the changes they have made to the surface and the run-off areas. “The car was feeling strong. I thoroughly enjoyed it. “The circuit is amazing. It is one of the best circuits but this was an odd day, like a summer’s day in the UK. It was summer this morning then it rains with huge hailstones, then sunny and hot and humid and then rain again. \"I feel really confident out there but we won’t know until we get out there on Saturday but on either conditions I felt really strong today.” Despite the conditions, only one driver crashed all day - Sauber’s Zhou Gunayu lost control through Turn Five in the first session and broke his front suspension.

{"context": "Tendai and Crispen welcomed their son, Zane, into the world in January\n\nWhen Tendai Chisambara was told she needed to undergo dialysis for her chronic kidney disease she was also told it would be practically impossible to conceive whilst receiving treatment. According to a recent study, in the six years between 2008 to 2014 just 584 women worldwide gave birth successfully while undergoing dialysis. But, against all the odds, in 2023 Tendai received the unexpected news she was pregnant and in January gave birth to her son, Zane.\n\nTendai, 36, came to Sheffield from Zimbabwe with her family aged 14. She was studying at University in Bradford when she was first diagnosed with kidney failure aged 20. “My feet would be really swollen after uni. I used to elevate them but they weren’t getting better so my parents persuaded me to go to the hospital,\" she said. Doctors in Sheffield informed her that her kidney function was deteriorating slowly and she would need medication, dialysis and ultimately a transplant. She was also advised that “putting another body in my body would mean my kidney would be under too much strain”. During pregnancy healthy kidneys have to work overtime to keep the blood clean whilst the baby releases wastes into the mother’s blood stream. For women whose kidneys do not work pregnancy is even harder on the body and more frequent dialysis is recommended to keep the blood as clean as possible.\n\nTendai and Crispen had started to look into surrogacy when Tendai became pregnant\n\nWhile Tendai said she was initially able to come to terms with the double bombshell, she said it had become harder as time wore on. “When my boyfriend became my husband we managed it together. I was on medication and we got used to the routine,\" she said. \"But then all our friends started having babies and I was going to lots of baby showers.\" She said she and her husband, Crispen, had started to look into surrogacy when, unexpectedly, she fell pregnant. “I didn’t believe it. It couldn’t be real. I showed my husband the test,\" she said. \"We bought four more pregnancy tests to make sure.\" During her pregnancy she was monitored frequently by multiple health care teams including an obstetrician, midwi", "continuation": "fe, kidney doctor, dialysis nurse and kidney dietician at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. She had to go into hospital three times a week during the pregnancy for dialysis and her baby’s progress was continually monitored via frequent ultrasound scans to identify and treat problems early.\n\nTendai said she and Crispen \"didn't believe it\" when it turned out she was pregnant\n\nDr Veena Reddy, Consultant Nephrologist, said: “Successful pregnancies in women on dialysis are extremely rare. \"The level of care and coordination between several specialist teams including the renal team, dieticians, anaesthetists and the maternal medicine team at Jessop Wing has been phenomenal.\" Just after Zane’s birth in January, there came another twist in Tendai’s story. A kidney donor had been found and she was earmarked for a transplant. However, she made the difficult decision to turn down the offer, saying she wanted to make sure her son was looked after first. “If I had the transplant I would have had to give up holding my baby,\" she said. \"I wouldn’t be able to breast feed him. I couldn’t do that.” Having made the decision to decline the transplant, Tendai is now back on the waiting list. She no longer requires weekly dialysis, but is still taking medication for her condition. But, she said it had all been worth it to become a mother, saying: \"He is incredible. He smiles at everyone.

It said another three people were killed and 10 wounded in the western Hodeidah province. The Iran-backed rebel group described the attacks - which also hit power stations and ports - as \"barbaric\".

He provided no further details about who the UN detainees were. Referring to the strikes on Sanaa's airport, he said: \"The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge - just a few meters from where we were - and the runway were damaged. \"We will need to wait for the damage to the airport to be repaired before we can leave,\" Dr Tedros added. \"I regret the recent escalation between Yemen and Israel, and remain deeply concerned about the risk of further escalation in the region.\" he wrote on X. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its \"fighter jets conducted intelligence-based strikes on military targets belonging to the Houthi terrorist regime on the western coast and inland Yemen\". It targeted \"military infrastructure\" at Sanaa's airport as well as the Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations, and sites in the Al-Hudaydah, Salif and Ras Kanatib ports on the west coast, the IDF said. In comments shortly after the strikes, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it would \"continue to cut off the terror arm of the Iranian axis of evil until we complete the job\", adding \"we are only just starting with [the Houthis]\". Early on Friday, the IDF reported that one missile fired from Yemen was intercepted before crossing into Israeli territory. Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, head of the Houthis' supreme revolutionary committee, called Thursday's strikes on Yemen \"barbaric\" and \"aggressive\". He said that \"confrontations with American and Israeli arrogance\" will continue until the conflict in Gaza stops. Several people injured by the strikes at the airport in Sanaa told Houthi-run broadcaster Al Masirah that the runway was struck three times before the airport's control tower was also hit. One man, who identified himself as Dr Abbas Rajeh, said the police hospital he works in treated 10 patients after the attacks - one had already died, another was in critical condition, and others had minor injuries or broken bones.\n\nIran described the strikes as a \"clear violation of international peace and security\". Houthi rebels have been attacking Israel since the first months of the Gaza war, which began in October 2023. A Houthi missile strike injured more than a dozen people in Israel last week. Israel has carried out intermittent strikes against Houthis in retaliation. Earlier this week, Israel's defence minister said the country was preparing to \"strike hard\" at the Houthis, warning it would \"decapitate\" the group's leadership. The Houthis are an armed political and religious group backed by Iran. The group has ruled large parts of western Yemen, including the capital Sanaa, since ousting the internationally recognised government in 2015."}
{"context": "Flowers have been placed close to where Kirillov and his assistant were killed\n\nRussia's authorities say a 29-year-old man from Uzbekistan has been detained over the killing of senior general Igor Kirillov and his assistant in Moscow. Lt Gen Igor Kirillov, head of the Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Forces, was outside a residential block early on Tuesday when an explosive device hidden in an electric scooter was detonated remotely, the authorities say. Russia's Investigative Committee (SK) says the suspect - who has not been publicly named - has admitted he was recruited by Ukrainian special services. The SK provided no evidence to back its claim. Ukraine's security service SBU had already claimed it was behind the killing, a source told the BBC on Tuesday.\n\nThe suspect has not been publicly named\n\nThe Ukrainian source said Kirillov, 54, was \"a legitimate target\" and alleged he had carried out war crimes. On Monday, the day before the killing, Ukraine charged the Russian general in absentia, saying he was \"responsible for the mass use of banned chemical weapons\". Moscow denies the allegations. In a statement on Wednesday, the SK said the detained man - born in 1995 - was a citizen of Uzbekistan. It said he was \"suspected of committing a terrorist act\" and that during interrogation, \"he explained that he was recruited by the Ukrainian special services\". The explosive device had been placed on the scooter parked near the entrance to the residential building where Kirillov lived, the SK said. To monitor the location, the suspect had rented a car, where he installed a video camera that was livestreaming to the attack organisers in Ukraine's city of Dnipro, the investigative committee added. When Kirillov and his assistant Ilya Polikarpov left the building, the explosive device was remotely activated, the statement said.\n\nKirillov was killed outside an apartment block on Tuesday\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's Federal Security Services (FSB) published a video of the suspect's interrogation. In the footage, a dark-haired man wearing handcuffs with what appears to be a visible rip in his coat is seen speaking directly to the camera. He is heard saying in Russian that he had been offered a reward of $100,000 and a European passport in exchange for killing Kirillov. The FSB added that on Ukraine's instructions, he arrived in Moscow and received a homemade explosive device. It is unclear whether the suspect's confession was made under duress.\n\nKirillov is thought to be the most senior military figure assassinated inside Russia since President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. As well as being charged by Ukraine, Kirillov had previously been sanctioned by the UK over the alleged use of chemical weapons in Ukraine.

Angela Bogg spent hours speaking to the artist towards the end of his life in the 1970s, after becoming an admirer of his urban landscapes while visiting Salford Art Gallery on her lunch break. The then-27-year-old's recordings were found by her son after her death in 2022 and have now been donated to the arts centre that bears Lowry's name. In them, the artist spoke about being a \"homebird\" as a young man and how the paintings that made him famous only came about because of a house move.\n\nThe chats took place after Mrs Bogg met the director of the art gallery while working as an administrator at the nearby University of Salford. During a talk she gave in 2020, she said he introduced her to Lowry and a friendship grew between them, which led to her taking a borrowed reel-to-reel recorder to his home in the Tameside village of Mottram in Longdendale.\n\nLS Lowry told Angela Bogg his signature style was inspired by his family's move to Pendlebury\n\nShe explained they would talk at length and though Lowry was a notoriously private man, the 85-year-old opened up to her across more than 20 hours of recording. The interviews, which were unearthed in their entirety for the first time after her death in 2022, include Lowry's reflections on life, love and, of course, his art. In them, he said he had almost stumbled across his distinctive style of painting when his family moved from Manchester to a particularly urban part of Salford. “I was interested in portrait painting until I went to live in Pendlebury,\" he said. \"The industrial scene got me. \"I disliked [painting industrial scenes] at first, then I got used to it. \"I began to think there is something in it... then I began to think there was a lot in it.\"\n\nLowry's art has become instantly recognisable and draws art lovers to galleries around the world\n\nLowry said he was not sure why he had persevered with art as a young man, but had felt driven to continue. \"I don’t know what kept me on painting,\" he said. \"Something did. I don’t know what it was. And I kept on, you see.\" He said it could take him \"a year\" to finish a piece, due to the detail of \"all the little figures\", but when he was active, he would be working on 21 paintings \"at a time\". \"I'd leave them for a time and then go back to them,\" he said.\n\nLowry's works now achieve huge prices at auction and have sold f", "continuation": "or more than £7m\n\nThe artist said he had started to paint his landscapes after World War One. \"I began to wonder if anybody had ever recorded or done it,\" he said. \"I found they hadn't, so I said 'I'll try and do if I can and once I've done it, I'll get out and join some friends in business'. \"But I didn't join my friends in business. \"Times had changed and I got rather not fond of work.\" He added that from there, he \"got used to it and then I got to like it, then I got fascinated and then I began trying to put it on the map if I could\".\n\nMr Bogg said his mother intended to write a book about LS Lowry but never found time\n\nLowry spoke about how he had been \"a homebird all the time\" as a young man, adding the thought of leaving home \"never entered my head\".

{"context": "Eurozone cuts interest rate for first time in 5 years\n\nThe EU has become the second major global economy to cut its lending rate this week, saying it had made progress in tackling inflation. The European Central Bank (ECB) announced a cut in its main interest rate from an all-time high of 4% to 3.75%. That follows Canada's decision on Wednesday to cut its official lending rate. The ECB's move comes as voters head to the polls for EU-wide elections over the next four days, with the outcome expected to reflect people's unhappiness over cost-of-living pressures. Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB said the outlook for inflation had improved \"markedly\", paving the way for the rate cut. However, she warned that inflation was likely to remain above the bank’s 2% target “well into next year”, averaging 2.5% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025. The ECB would keep interest rate policy \"sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary\" to bring inflation down to the Bank's 2% target, she said. However, she added: \"We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.\" Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors said the rate cut had been widely anticipated but would nevertheless come as a relief to consumers and businesses on the continent. “The ECB has stolen a march on the Bank of England and [US] Federal Reserve – who are both potentially still a few months away from cutting – and will breathe life into an economy that desperately needs some form of stimulus,\" she said. Central banks have kept rates high for the past two years to bear down on the rate at which prices are rising, with most targeting an annual inflation rate of 2%. But higher interest rates tend to dampen economic growth. A cut in interest rates should boost economic activity by making it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow. Meeting in Frankfurt on Thursday, the EU's rate-setting body decided to cut rates, despite a slight uptick in inflation in May. Inflation rose to 2.6%, from 2.4% in April in the 27-nation bloc. The ECB's decision followed Canada's rate cut on Wednesday which brought its headline rate down from 5% to 4.75%, after inflation there fell to 2.7%. Sweden and Switzerland have also trimmed rates. Ms Largarde gave a broader assessment of the eurozone's economic outlook. She said: \"Our overall confidence in the path ahead — because we have to be forward looking — has been increasing.\" But she also warned of potential “bumps in the road” ahead for the region. “The risks to economic growth are balanced in the near term, but remain tilted to the downside over the medium term,” she said, citing conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East. Geopolitical tensions could weigh on growth, while extreme weather events and the climate crisis more broadly could drive up food prices, she warned.\n\nHowever, Katherine Neiss, chief European economist at investment firm PGIM said she was \"reasonably confident\" that the ECB would cut rates further over the summer or autumn, resulting in eurozone rates that were at 3.5% or lower by the end of the year. \"Growth is encouragingly recovering from the recession that the euro area went through towards the end of last year, but it's still sluggish,\" she told the BBC's Today Programme. That factor, combined with slowing inflation and easing wage growth, would justify another rate cut, she said.\n\nUK rates have yet to start coming down, although there is some speculation the Bank of England could trim them as early as this month. UK inflation has fallen to 2.3%, a long way down from its peak of over 11% in late 2022. Last month, the International Monetary Fund suggested the Bank of England should cut rates from their current 5.25% to 3.5% by the end of next year. However, George Godber from Polar Capital said the upcoming election in the UK would \"complicate\" the Bank of England's next decision on 20 June. The Bank is politically independent, but the Conservative government had made falling int", "continuation": "erest rates part of their promise to voters, which could influence \"mindsets\", Mr Godber said. \"If they cut it'll be political, if they don’t cut it'll be political,\" he said. The US Federal Reserve is also expected to cut rates in the coming months, although the latest US inflation figure is higher, at 3.4%. The Fed was likely to make its first move on rates ahead of the immediate run-up to voting in November, Mr Godber said."}
{"context": "'Alexander-Arnold experiment is surely over for Southgate'\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold cut a forlorn figure as he joined England’s players in front of the supporters who turned on them after the desperate display in the draw against Denmark in Frankfurt. Alexander-Arnold looked like a man with matters weighing heavily on his mind, as did England manager Gareth Southgate after a ragged England display that saw them scrape a fortunate 1-1 against the vastly superior Danes. Southgate discovered major tournaments are no time for experiments and his strategy of using Liverpool’s lavishly gifted defender in central midfield is surely over after an England performance that was lacking in structure, energy and at times veered dangerously close to shambolic. Alexander-Arnold must not be used as scapegoat, a fig leaf to cover up the malaise that has overcome England under Southgate since they took the lead against Serbia in their opening game. This is on the manager as much, if not more, than the player who is being used out of position. On Thursday, England once again demonstrated their dangerous habit of going into rapid retreat once they took an 18th-minute lead through captain Harry Kane. England had more problems than Southgate will care to mention, at least publicly, as they were left counting their good fortune that Denmark did not add to Morten Hjulmand’s thunderous 34th-minute equaliser. Alexander-Arnold’s unaccustomed role is one of those problems and it surely signalled the end of what even Southgate himself described as an “experiment” when he was called over to be substituted only nine minutes after half-time, a move made by a manager who does not have a reputation for hasty changes. There was no lack of effort but Alexander-Arnold looked like a square peg in a round hole, which is effectively what he is. The partnership with Declan Rice was non-existent, unbalanced and too often overrun by Denmark, with their midfield revolving around the veteran Christian Eriksen.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'England aren't flowing as we would like' - Southgate\n\nSouthgate made mention of the absence of Kalvin Phillips, who has become a maligned figure throughout his struggles with Manchester City and on loan at West Ham United, but was so influential in England’s run to the Euro 2020 final. Phillips was a solid defensive shield, adept at scenting danger, an unspectacular anchor in that area but an important one. It was why Southgate kept faith with him until the player’s lack of fitness and form meant he could no longer justify his selection. Phillips was also a strong physical presence, allowing Rice to move in and get closer to opponents to exert pressure, which he has not been able to achieve against either Serbia or Denmark. The presence of Phillips also allowed Rice to spread his own influence wider. He was not only a holding midfield player but also capable of making surging, creative runs from midfield as he did to such great effect for Arsenal this season. Here, both dropped deep to protect the defence, Rice perhaps feeling that responsibility even more acutely because Alexander-Arnold’s strengths lie in positions further forward. Rice was barely seen other than protecting England’s defence in their two group games, robbing Southgate of an important, high-quality weapon, while Alexander-Arnold’s natural attacking instincts make him occasionally vulnerable in front of the back four. It was the worst of both worlds, resulting in a torrid, tortuous experience all round for England, not just in midfield.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Analysis: Does Harry Kane need to do better?\n\nKane, despite scoring, was barely involved elsewhere while even Jude Bellingham looked leg-weary and off the pace. He was fortunate not to join his captain in being substituted after 69 minutes as Southgate looked to his bench for answers. The manner in which Kane has been marginalised in both games must also be a source of concern. England simply have to find a way of getting their world-class captain and striker into the game and once again he was, goal aside, peripheral. Chelsea’s Conor Gallagher has emerged as the most likely replacement for Alexander-Arnold in midfield, but even he managed to earn himself a cheap yellow card shortly after coming on. He will be favourite to face Slovenia but Southgate may even look at Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo or Adam Wharton of Crystal Palace. England knew victory would leave them top of Group C after Serbia snatched a late draw with Slovenia, but if the idea inspired them they had a funny way of showing it. Watching England is too often becoming rinse and repeat. Take the lead. Fall back.\n\nSerbia were not good enough to punish Southgate’s side but Denmark, under the shrewd leadership of coach Kasper Hjulmand, relished the opportunity. Southgate insists he does not ask England to drop into conservative mode when they go ahead but it is a recurring theme - which means either the manager’s message is not getting across or he needs to put it over with greater force. The positive England can draw on is that they did not lose and still remain in a strong position to top their group heading into the last 16. Southgate will not panic, nor should he, but he must also accept England have to improve against Slovenia. Their potential future Euro 2024 opponents Italy, France and Spain will not lose sleep after watching those struggles on an admittedly poor playing surface. Phil Foden’s place in the side was a major conversation before kick-off. He was another removed with more than 20 minutes left but he was England’s most dangerous player - not amid stiff competition admittedly - and struck the post in the second half. Southgate, instead, went like-for-like as he replaced Kane with Ollie Watkins, Bukayo Saka with Jarrod Bowen, Eberechi Eze coming on for Foden. There were no answers to be found there, although Watkins did force a save from Kasper Schmeichel. Anthony Gordon and Cole Palmer were left kicking their heels.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \"We know we can improve\" - England captain Harry Kane speaks after Denmark draw\n\nCrystal Palace defender Marc Guehi again emerged with credit with another solid display in defence but there were very few other straws for Southgate to clutch at. England remain at the top of the group but ambitions must stretch further than a place in the knockout stages given the expectations that accompanied Southgate and his players to Germany. Here, under the roof in Frankfurt, England flouted their billing as pre-tournament favourites. England’s supporters made their feelings clear from early in the second half. There were several outbursts of loud jeering throughout that period and the response at the final whistle was predictably hostile. Southgate and England’s players will make all the right noises but they have delivered one indifferent, patchy performance and one abysmal one.

{"context": "Stokes admits putting 'too much emphasis' on Ashes\n\nEngland and Australia drew the previ", "continuation": "ous Ashes series 2-2 in 2023\n\nEngland captain Ben Stokes has admitted he put \"too much emphasis\" on next year's Ashes in Australia and will now be \"toning down expectations\". At the beginning of the home summer, Stokes explained an overhaul of his team, including the retirement of James Anderson, was done with the Ashes in mind. Before they travel down under next November, England have the final Test in New Zealand, a one-off match at home to Zimbabwe in May and a marquee five-Test series hosting India. \"In interviews in the summer and stuff like that a lot was pointed towards the Ashes, which was a long way away,\" said Stokes. \"You do always have one eye on that but we have six more Tests before that. \"It's just making sure I keep my focus on being in the here and now and what we've got coming up, and when the Ashes is our next series, then we will focus on it.\" England start their 17th, and final, Test of 2024 in Hamilton on Saturday (22:00 GMT Friday) with the chance to become only the third visiting side to win a three-match series 3-0 in New Zealand. Just once before, in 2016, have England played 17 Tests in a calendar year. After a number of players opted to drive north from second-Test venue Wellington, England did not name a team on Thursday and will instead wait until Friday's training session. Stokes said he expects Harry Brook - the world's new number-one Test batter - to be fit after an ankle problem, but hinted at freshening up the pace-bowling attack. \"Even though we finished early in Wellington it felt like all the overs from the seamers were more than the scorecard because of the weather,\" he said. \"The lads put in tough graft, so we'll see how they pull up.\"\n\nThe finale in Hamilton is also the last before Test head coach Brendon McCullum brings the England white-ball teams under his control early new year. Asked if he expected to be part of England's plans for a tour of India in January and the Champions Trophy in February, all-rounder Stokes simply said: \"We'll see\". Before the home series against West Indies in July, England took the decision to end the international career of Anderson, their all-time leading wicket-taker. Wicketkeeper Jamie Smith was chosen ahead of Ben Foakes and Jonny Bairstow, and Shoaib Bashir promoted over Jack Leach as first-choice spinner. At the time, 18 months before the Australia tour, Stokes said: \"We had to make some decisions around what we think is best for the team going into that Ashes series. We want to go out there and we want to get that urn back.\" The captain's stance was a sharp pivot away from the message of his previous two years in charge, when he and coach McCullum would insist on focusing on the task at hand. And in Hamilton on Thursday, 33-year-old Stokes said: \"Through my own fault I maybe spoke a little too much about the Ashes and putting too much emphasis on that series considering how much cricket we had to play before that. \"Every Englishman and Australian knows the Ashes is a big series for both teams, but toning down on the expectations on that series is something I will be better at in the build-up. \"In leadership roles, you can differ from where you first started and think that's the right thing to be saying or be thinking about, which then takes you away from what has been a successful mindset. It's a learning curve as a leader, I guess.\"\n• None Get cricket news sent straight to your phone"}

{"context": "Seven swing states set to decide the 2024 US election\n\nAbout 240 million people are eligible to vote in this year’s US election, but only a relatively small number of them are likely to decide who becomes the next president. Experts believe there are only a handful of so-called \"swing\" states that could plausibly be won by either Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump. Seven of them - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - hold the keys to the White House. Both campaigns are therefore targeting undecided voters in these states.\n\nThe Democrats gained the presidency in 2020 with the support of the Grand Canyon State, which narrowly voted to back the party's candidate for the first time since the 1990s. This state borders Mexico for hundreds of miles, and has become a focal point of the nation’s immigration debate. Border crossings have fallen in recent months from record highs, which have made the issue near the top of voters' concerns. Trump has repeatedly attacked Ms Harris’s record on immigration, because she was given a role by President Joe Biden to try and ease the border crisis. He has also vowed to carry out “the largest deportation operation” in US history if he regains the presidency. Arizona has also hosted a bitter row over abortion access, after state Republicans tried unsuccessfully to reinstate a 160-year-old near-total ban on terminating pregnancies. The issue has become even more polarising since 2022 when the US Supreme Court overturned a landmark ruling that gave women a constitutional right to abortion.\n\nOur list of swing states closely matches the list of places where Trump-backed Republican officials tried to thwart Mr Biden’s win in the 2020 election. In Georgia's Fulton County, alleged election interference has landed Mr Trump in one of his four criminal prosecutions (Trump has been convicted in one case, while the remaining are ongoing). He and 18 others are accused of conspiring to overturn his narrow defeat to Mr Biden in the state. Trump denies any wrongdoing, and the case looks increasingly unlikely to be heard in court before the election. A third of Georgia's population is African-American, one of the country’s largest proportions of black residents, and it is believed that this demographic was instrumental in Mr Biden flipping the state in 2020. Some disillusionment with Mr Biden had been reported among America’s black voters, but the Harris campaign hopes to animate this constituency.\n\nThe Great Lakes state has picked the winning presidential candidate in the last two elections. Despite backing Mr Biden in 2020, it has become symbolic of a nationwide backlash over the president’s support for Israel during that country’s war in Gaza. During Michigan’s Democratic primary contest in February, more than 100,000 voters chose the “uncommitted” option on their ballots, part of a campaign mounted by activists who want the US government to halt its military aid to Israel. Notably, Michigan has the country’s largest proportion of Arab-Americans - a demographic whose support for Mr Biden was in jeopardy. But Ms Harris has taken a harder tone on Israel, and some Gaza protesters have told the BBC they hope she will be more sympathetic to their cause. Trump has highlighted the state’s significance in his potential path to victory. Commenting on events in the Middle East, he has called on Israel to finish its campaign over Hamas in Gaza, but \"get it over with fast”.\n\nThe Silver State has voted Democrat for the last several elections, but there are signs of a possible turnaround by the Republicans. Recent averages published by poll-tracking firm 538 indicate that polls once showed Trump enjoying a wide lead over Mr Biden, but that advantage has shrunk since Ms Harris became the top of the ticket. Democrats had hoped a candidate with greater appeal to younger and more diverse voters would close the gap. Both candidates are vying to win the state’s sizeable Latino population. Despite the fact that the US economy has shown strong growth and jobs creation since Mr Biden took the presidency, the post-Covid recovery has been slower in Nevada than elsewhere. At 5.1%, the state has the highest unemployment rate in the country, after California and the District of Columbia, according to the latest US government statistics. If Trump comes to power again, he has vowed a return to an agenda of lower taxes across the board, and fewer regulations.\n\nPolls appear to have tightened in the Tar Heel State after Ms Harris assumed her place at the top of the Democratic ticket, and some analysts now call it a \"toss-up\". That has perhaps been reflected in Trump's choice to go there for his first outdoor rally since an attempt was made on his life in July. “This state is a very, very big state to win,\" he told the crowd. For their part, the Democrats decided to give a platform to the state's governor, Roy Cooper, on the final night of their party convention. North Carolina borders Georgia, and shares some of its top electoral concerns, as well as those in Arizona, another Sun Belt state. Trump carried North Carolina in 2020 but did so by just over 70,000 votes, which has further buoyed Democrats' hopes that this \"purple\" state (one that could vote red or blue) could be winnable in this election year.\n\nBoth sides have also been campaigning doggedly in the Keystone state, which is where Donald Trump survived the first assassination attempt. The state proved pivotal in the 2020 election, backing Mr Biden. He has often spoken of his connection to the working-class city of Scranton, where he grew up. The economy is a a top issue here, as well as many other places. Inflation spiked across the country under the Biden administration, before gradually reducing. Pennsylvanians are far from unique among Americans for feeling cost-of-living pressures as a result of inflation. But the price of groceries has risen faster in their state than in any other, according to market intelligence provider Datasembly. The BBC has previously reported on how people were struggling to cope in Erie - a bellwether county for the rest of Pennsylvania, where as many as one in eight people are considered “food insecure”. High inflation could hurt Ms Harris across the US as polling suggests it is giving voters an unfavourable view of the economy. Trump has sought to attack her by pinning her to the Biden economy.\n\nThe Badger State also picked the winning presidential candidate in both 2016 and 2020, by a margin of little more than 20,000 votes each time. Pundits have suggested it is in marginal states like this one where an impact could be made by third-party candidates who are campaigning against the policies of the big two candidates. Polling had indicated that a sizeable show of support for independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr could have harmed the vote tallies for Ms Harris or Trump. Kennedy susp", "continuation": "ended his campaign in late August and endorsed Trump. Democrats have been fighting to have Green Party candidate Jill Stein removed from the ballot here, saying the party did not comply with state election laws, and has also filed an elections complaint against Cornel West, a left-leaning academic.

{"context": "Shona Robison said her Budget will focus on eradicating child poverty and tackling the climate emergency\n\nScotland's Finance Secretary Shona Robison is under pressure to embark on wide-ranging reforms as she prepares to set out her draft Budget for next year. Spending watchdog Audit Scotland warns that the NHS is unsustainable in its present state, local authorities want more cash and autonomy, and unions say education is threatened by a lack of teachers. There are also calls for the SNP to replace the council tax with a new system and to restrict access to \"freebies\" such as state-funded university tuition. Robison said the Budget would focus on eradicating child poverty and \"tackling the climate emergency\" while improving public services and growing the economy.\n\nHer tax-and-spending bill will be scrutinised in the Scottish Parliament over the winter before a vote in February, when she will need support from outside the ranks of the SNP minority administration for it to become law.\n\nThe UK government says an extra £3.4bn is available to Robison for this Budget, which covers 2025/26, as a result of decisions made by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in her October Budget at Westminster. That's because the lion's share of Scottish government funding comes in the form of an annual lump sum from the Treasury known as the block grant, calculated using a formula designed in the 1970s by a Labour politician, Joel Barnett. But much of the increase has already been swallowed up by Scottish government decisions to raise salaries for public sector workers who, according to the Fraser of Allander Institute at Strathclyde University, are both more numerous per head and, \"on average, paid more in Scotland,\" than those elsewhere in the UK. The institute's annual budget report, external says that despite the increases in funding, the settlement for 2025/26 \"is still tricky\" and the finance secretary \"will have limited room for manoeuvre\". Other pressures include the SNP's decision to fund a partial reversal of Reeves’ restriction of winter fuel payments for pensioners, and the impact of Labour’s decision to increase employers' national insurance contributions. There are also calls for Robison to spend some £220m replicating relief from business rates - a form of property tax - announced by the chancellor for retail, hospitality and leisure firms in England. \"Given that there's no difference in the challenges being faced either side of the border, we think it's really incumbent on the Scottish government to pass on that 40% rates relief,\" says Stacey Dingwall, head of policy and external affairs for the Federation of Small Businesses Scotland. Ms Dingwall says the Scottish government also needs to keep its promise to reset relations with business after a net loss of 20,000 small Scottish firms, external in 2023.\n\nScotland's total budget last year amounted to some £60bn. The UK government, external says the block grant for 2025/26 will be £47.7bn. Ms Robison must balance the books every year as the devolved administration has only limited powers to borrow money. The remainder of her budget is raised by taxes administered in Edinburgh, such as income tax, land and buildings transaction tax (formerly known as stamp duty), and business rates. Since devolution in 1999, the Scottish government has been responsible for a wide range of public services, including health, education, policing, justice and housing. Control of defence, foreign affairs, currency and immigration remains with the UK government. But, in the quarter of a century since the establishment of the modern Scottish Parliament, extra powers over welfare and taxation have been transferred from London to Edinburgh. That has seen devolved social security spending jump from £192m in 2018/19 to £5.1bn in 2023/24, according to the Fraser of Allander Institute. The sharpest divergence from Westminster welfare policy came through the introduction in 2021 of a weekly benefit for low income families, currently £26.70 per child, known as the Scottish Child Payment.\n\n\"It is definitely making an impact,\" says Chris Birt, associate director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, who would like the budget to include more investment in social housing; better funding for social care and childcare; and council tax reform. \"Most people don't give a monkey's if services are provided by UK government, Scottish government, health board, council, whatever, they just want that support to be", "continuation": " there,\" says Mr Birt. \"We definitely need to have a much more radical discussion about how we support people, not how we worry about our institutions.\" As well as divergence from Westminster on welfare, there has also been a shift on tax policy. At present anyone earning more than around £29,000 per year in Scotland pays more income tax than their compatriots in England. Those earning below that threshold pay slightly less, in a system which is now more complex than anywhere else in the UK.\n\nJohn Swinney promised to guide Scotland out of \"a long, dark winter\" into the \"warmth of spring\"\n\nMs Robison must also consider what to do with council tax after last year's shock decision by then First Minister Humza Yousaf to reintroduce a freeze of the levy. An extension of that freeze in this year's Budget would be, if anything, an even greater surprise, throwing Yousaf's successor, John Swinney, into a bitter battle with local authority leaders. It is therefore considered unlikely. Over their 17 years in power at Holyrood, the SNP have also maintained and expanded the provision of a wide range of state-funded benefits, including personal care for the elderly, university tuition, prescriptions, and bus travel for the youngest and oldest Scots. Some critics, including Alison Payne, research director with the think tank, Reform Scotland, say this is a poor use of a limited pot of cash. \"Where budgets are tight and you have dwindling resources, you need to have a conversation about whether it is better to target what support you have to those who need it most,\" says Ms Payne.\n\nThe Scottish government is responsible for health and a wide range of public services\n\nBut it is the National Health Service which provides the biggest headache for Robison. Not only does it account for 40% of her Budget but it is under extraordinary pressure. The public spending watchdog, Audit Scotland, says the country's current healthcare delivery model is not sustainable, with a \"worsening financial position\" and \"ongoing performance issues.\" Here too there is a call not just for increased funding, or tinkering with existing policy, but for fundamental reform, potentially up to the point of stopping some services. Ahead of the budget, Scottish Labour said \"every institution in Scotland\" had \"been left weaker by SNP mismanagement and waste.\" The Scottish Conservatives accused the SNP of having \"failed Scotland by making people pay more while getting less\". Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Alex Cole-Hamilton, said the SNP \"would have to pull out all the stops\" to persuade his party to support the budget. The Scottish Greens said they wanted to see \"a progressive budget that invests in tackling the climate crisis and lifting children out of poverty\". The Alba Party urged Swinney to reject any proposals from parties \"that want to rip up the social contract that Alex Salmond delivered whilst in office\". Taken together it is all a huge challenge for Robison and her boss, John Swinney, who has promised to guide Scotland out of \"a long, dark winter\" into the \"warmth of spring\"."}

{"context": "Win over Australia would change narrative for England\n\nEngland v Australia is live on BBC Test Match Special on BBC Sounds and Radio 5 Sports Extra on Saturday from 17:45 BST, with text commentary and in-play video clips on the BBC Sport website and app\n\nIf one swallow doesn't make a summer, one washout against Scotland certainly does not ruin a T20 World Cup. England admitted being below their best in the play that was possible on Tuesday and allowing Scotland's openers to rattle along to 90-0 in 10 overs hardly showed early form of champions. But the nature of this tournament means if England lose to Australia on Saturday evening there is a very plausible series of results that would still send them through to the Super 8s. It is not ideal - and would be precarious with the Caribbean rainy season a factor - but not the end of the world.\n\nYou can also argue that England are better with their backs against the wall. They won their first T20 World Cup at the Kensington Oval in Barbados, the venue for their latest meeting with Australia, in 2010. Earlier in that tournament they were beaten by West Indies and only scraped through the first group stage courtesy of net run-rate. When they won this title again in 2022, the last edition of the tournament, England were beaten in the group stage by Ireland. Even their famous 50-over win of 2019 had the group stage wobbles against Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Australia which left them needing to win four straight games to win the title. When England have breezed through the group stages, in the 2017 Champions Trophy or 2021 T20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, they have come unstuck in the semi-finals. But, despite all of that, there remains a feeling that Saturday is a crucial moment, as much for changing the feeling around this whole white-ball set-up. Rightly or wrongly, and no matter how much Jos Buttler wants to move on from it, their struggles in India at the 50-over World Cup last year hang over this side. The rain in England and then Barbados, plus cricket’s franchise-heavy calendar, means Buttler’s side have only played 10 completed white-ball matches in almost seven months since India. They remain relaxed off the field. Jofra Archer took Phil Salt to his family home to see his dogs and two pet parrots on Thursday before Harry Brook trained in a Hawaiian shirt as the loser of England's football warm-up game. A win against their oldest cricketing rivals would allow everyone to breathe a little easier again. \"It'll be good for momentum, it'll be good for confidence,\" England batter Jonny Bairstow said about the prospect of a win in Bridgetown. \"But at the same time, if that doesn't happen, then it's not a derailer to the group.\" Of course Bairstow's history with Australia is long and storied. Part of Andrew Strauss' side that crumbled in the 2013-14 Ashes and a series winner in the 2015 return, he was at the eye of the storm last summer when Alex Carey's stumping dismissed him at Lord's.\n\nEngland trained at Winward Cricket Club on Thursday and then at the Kensington Oval on Friday\n\nThat controversial dismissal helped Australia take a 2-0 le", "continuation": "ad, only for a charged-up England to come back to level the series across the remaining three Tests. The stumping row has been brought back into focus by the recent release of the Australia’s fly-on-the-wall documentary covering the series. In one episode Australia players, including T20 captain Mitchell Marsh, freely recall how they tried to hide their sniggers when sitting across from a seething Bairstow in the Lord's dining room. \"I've not seen any of it to be quite honest with you,\" Bairstow said bluntly. \"I've got other things that I watch on TV. \"The impact it had on us as a side was actually a very positive effect and you can make your own assumptions as to what effect it had on Australia…\" England have a full squad to pick from with the only debate again in the bowling attack - a choice between Reece Topley and Mark Wood. The hierarchy would want to keep consistency in their much-discussed search for \"role clarity\" but Topley's record against left-handers with the new ball - he averages 19.8 against left-handed batters in the powerplay since the last World Cup, while Australia have David Warner and Travis Head as their top two - may be too tempting to resist. Marsh suggested on Friday his Test counterpart Pat Cummins will make his first appearance of the tournament against England. Cummins was rested for their opening win against Oman, whose already tight turnaround after the Indian Premier League was complicated further by flight delays. Left-arm quick Mitchell Starc hobbled off in his final over against Oman but Australia insist the issue was only cramp. He bowled at practice on Friday morning. Defeat by Australia in Ahmedabad in November officially ended England’s reign as 50-over world champions. Another loss on Saturday would not be terminal to their T20 title defence but a momentum-boosting win would change the whole narrative.\n\nSaturday's meeting could be England's final match against David Warner (centre), who is set to retire from international duty after this tournament\n• None Get cricket news sent straight to your phone"}

{"context": "Both former President Donald Trump and E Jean Carroll were in court on Tuesday\n\nThe split screen of Donald Trump's re-election campaign and his parade of legal cases was on full display on Tuesday, as the Republican frontrunner, fresh off a victory in the Iowa caucuses, took his seat in yet another New York courtroom to face a multimillion dollar defamation suit.\n\nE Jean Carroll, a columnist who Mr Trump was previously found liable of sexually assaulting in the 1990s, is now seeking damages for defamatory statements he made about her during his presidency.\n\nSeated a few rows behind her, the former president stared intently at the woman he claims he \"never met, saw, or touched... and knows absolutely nothing about\".\n\nMs Carroll, for her part, did not appear to look at him. She faced towards the bench for nearly all of the proceedings, allowing Mr Trump only a view of her back.\n\nUnlike his last appearance in a Manhattan court - just last week, in an entirely different case - Mr Trump did not speak in the courtroom. But his restless and attentive posture projected a sense of agitation.\n\nLast May, a ", "continuation": "different jury trial found Mr Trump had sexually assaulted and defamed Ms Carroll - a decision he hopes to reverse on appeal. The findings of that case are considered relevant here.\n\nThis new trial is to determine whether Mr Trump harmed her with specific defamatory statements he made in 2019, and if so, how much money he must pay her in compensation.\n\nShawn Crowley, one of Ms Carroll's attorneys, said the jury would need to consider \"how much money Donald Trump should have to pay for what he's done\".\n\nAnd, she added, \"how much money will it take to make him stop\".\n\nAfter Ms Carroll came forward with her allegations of rape, Mr Trump immediately sought to dismiss her claims from the White House.\n\nIn June 2019, Mr Trump called her account a \"total false accusation\" and said \"I have no idea who this woman is\".\n\nThose statements, her lawyers argue, impugned her reputation and unleashed a torrent of death threats, rape threats, and online vitriol.\n\nMs Crowley told the court the former president had \"unleashed his followers to go after\" Carroll \"to threaten her life\".\n\nShe said Mr Trump had used \"the world's biggest microphone\" to defame and humiliate her client, and \"caused her to live every day in fear\".\n\nMr Trump continues to attack her relentlessly on his Truth Social account - even as his earlier statements were ruled defamatory.\n\nAs he spent Tuesday morning in court, the official account on Mr Trump's Truth Social platform blasted out more than two dozen posts, calling the case \"PURE FICTION\".\n\nAlina Habba, Mr Trump's lead attorney, claimed Carroll did not deserve damages, because her accusation of sexual assault had made her famous.\n\n\"Evidence will show you her career has prospered and she has been thrust back into the limelight Iike she always has wanted,\" Ms Habba said.\n\nMr Trump watched intently as prospective jurors filed one by one into the room, pivoting back and forth in his seat to size up each one as they answered questions from the judge.\n\nHis presence in the room during jury selection led to some unusual questions as lawyers and the judge sought to determine whether potential jurors could deliver an impartial verdict.\n\nQuestions included whether they had voted in the 2016 and 2020 elections; whether they believed in the QAnon conspiracy theory; whether they belonged to right-wing militia groups; and whether they supported the MeToo movement.\n\nTwo people said they believed the 2020 election had been stolen. One woman said she had volunteered for the Biden campaign that year. They were struck from the pool.\n\nDue to intense media and political scrutiny, the jury will remain anonymous. The judge urged jurors to use fake names when talking to each other, and the court will transport them by secure means from undisclosed locations to the courthouse.\n\nBy about 15:00 local time (20:00 GMT), nine New York residents officially took their seats in the jury box.\n\nBut Mr Trump left the room before his accuser's claims were re-aired by Judge Lewis Kaplan.\n\nIn a 2019 New York magazine piece, Ms Carroll, now 80, described a chance encounter with the then-real estate mogul inside a Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan in the 1990s.\n\nThe pair had bumped into each other while shopping, she said. Mr Trump then allegedly asked her for advice when buying lingerie for another woman and jokingly asked her to model it for him. But once in the changing rooms, Ms Carroll alleged the real estate tycoon lunged at her, pinned her against a wall and assaulted her.\n\nMr Trump immediately denied the story as \"totally false\". He has also repeatedly suggested Ms Carroll invented it to sell her memoir.\n\nThe May 2023 trial found that Mr Trump did sexually abuse and defame Ms Carroll.\n\nOn Tuesday, Judge Kaplan instructed the jury that Mr Trump's June 2019 statements were false, and defamatory, and that he knew they were false or probably false when he made them.\n\nThe Republican frontrunner did not attend the first civil trial based on Ms Carroll's claims. For calling her story a \"con job\" and a \"hoax\" in 2022, he is already on the hook for $5m (£4m) in damages.\n\nThe trial will be brief, but carries the potential for dramatic moments.\n\nMs Carroll is expected to testify on Wednesday and the case is scheduled to wrap on Thursday. But the judge, Lewis Kaplan, has ruled Mr Trump will be allowed to testify next Monday.\n\nThat comes after a bitter dispute between both legal teams over what the former president can say on the stand.\n\nIn a stern warning issued last week, the judge wrote: \"Mr Trump is precluded from offering any testimony, evidence or argument suggesting or implying that he did not sexually assault Ms Carroll, that she fabricated her account of the assault or that she had any motive to do so.\"\n\nMs Carroll's lead attorney, Roberta Kaplan (who is not related to Judge Kaplan), has said that Mr Trump will attempt to \"sow chaos\" with his testimony.\n\n\"There are any number of reasons why Mr Trump might perceive a personal or political benefit from intentionally turning this trial into a circus,\" she wrote in a memo to Judge Kaplan.\n\nIn response, Ms Habba said the former president is \"well aware\" of the court's ruling and \"the strict confines placed on his testimony\"."}

The anonymous accuser alleges she was assaulted at a house party after the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs) in New York and that an unnamed female celebrity was in the room at the time. In a statement, Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, dismissed the legal action as a \"blackmail attempt\". Mr Combs - who is in jail awaiting trial after being charged in September with sex-trafficking and other offences - denied the latest accusation.\n\nWarning: This story contains details that some readers may find distressing. The lawsuit was originally filed in October, and was refiled on Sunday to list Mr Carter as a defendant. The BBC has contacted Mr Carter's lawyer, Alex Spiro, and his publicist for comment. The legal action was filed under New York's Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Act, by a Texas-based lawyer, Tony Buzbee. Mr Buzbee has filed several lawsuits in recent months accusing Mr Combs of assault and rape - though none have provided the names of victims. The hip-hop artist is due to face a criminal trial on 5 May. Mr Carter said in a statement posted to social media: \"My lawyer received a blackmail attempt, called a demand letter, from a 'lawyer' named Tony Buzbee. \"What he had calculated was the nature of these allegations and the public scrutiny would make me want to settle. \"No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion.

Whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away, would you not agree?\" A statement from Mr Combs's legal team said this amended lawsuit was the latest in a series of \"shameless publicity stunts, designed to extract payments from celebrities who fear having lies spread about them, just as lies have been spread about Mr Combs\". The statement said that the judicial process would show Mr Combs to be innocent of all the allegations against him. He faces 30 other lawsuits. Responding to the criticism, Mr Buzbee posted a picture of himself to his Instagram as a younger man in military uniform, with a caption saying he had faced \"a coordinated and aggressive effort\" to stop him from bringing the case forward. \"I also won't allow anyone to scare my clients into silence,\" he wrote. \"Sunlight is the best disinfectant and I am quite certain the sun is coming.\" The accuser in Sunday's legal filing, who is identified only as \"Jane Doe\", said that in 2000, when she was 13, a friend dropped her off at the VMAs at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan. She approached limousine drivers outside the venue to try to gain access to the show, according to the legal action.

It is unclear whether the incident at the TV studio in Guayaquil was related to the disappearance from a prison in the same city of the boss of the Choneros gang, Adolfo Macías Villamar, or Fito as he is better known.\n\nPresident Noboa said on Tuesday that an \"internal armed conflict\" now existed in the country and he was mobilising the armed forces to carry out \"military operations to neutralise\" what he called \"transnational organised crime, terrorist organisations and belligerent non-state actors\".\n\nIn neighbouring Peru, the government ordered the immediate deployment of a police force to the border to prevent any instability spilling over into the country.\n\nThe US has said it condemns the \"brazen attacks\" in Ecuador and is \"co-ordinating closely\" with President Daniel Noboa and his Ecuadorean government and stands \"ready to provide assistance\".\n\nEcuador is one of the world's top banana exporters, but also exports oil, coffee, cocoa, shrimps and fish products.

Security forces have been trying to re-establish order in at least six jails where riots broke out on Monday.\n\nEight people were killed and three injured in attacks linked to criminal gangs in Guayaquil on Tuesday while two police officers were killed by \"armed criminals\" in the nearby town of Nobol, police said.\n\nIn the city of Riobamba, nearly 40 inmates, including another convicted drug lord, broke out of a prison.\n\nAt least seven police officers were also kidnapped and a video circulating on social media shows three of the kidnapped officers sitting on the ground with a gun pointed at them as one is forced to read a statement addressed to President Noboa, AFP reports.\n\n\"You declared war, you will get war,\" the officer reads out. \"You declared a state of emergency. We declare police, civilians and soldiers to be the spoils of war.\"\n\nPolice have ordered the evacuation of the government compound in Quito over security concerns.\n\nQuito residents told Reuters news agency the city was in chaos since news of the attack at the TV station in Guayaquil.\n\n\"There's too much nervousness in the city,\" said Mario Urena. \"At work, people are leaving earlier. All the people are leaving, you see a lot of traffic and alarms everywhere. There's a chaos.\"\n\nOther people in the city of Cuenca told AFP of their shock at seeing the TV station seized.\n\n\"In Ecuador, we have never seen this kind of thing, where a channel has been practically hijacked and a broadcast starts with shootings, with kidnappings,\" said Francisco Rosas. \"So what kind of security situation are we in? And if a television station is capable of receiving this type of robbery, this type of insecurity, imagine restaurants or shops.\"\n\nSoldiers patrolled the metro in Quito on Tuesday\n\nIn recent years, the country's prisons have been plagued by violent feuds between jailed members of rival gangs, often resulting in multiple massacres of inmates.\n\nThe Choneros are a powerful prison gang thought to be behind many of the deadly riots and prison fights which have erupted in Ecuador's jails over recent years.\n\nFito is thought to have absconded just hours before his planned transfer. Two prison guards have been detained on suspicion of helping him escape.\n\nHis escape is also a blow to the government of President Noboa, who was sworn in in November after winning an election tarnished by the assassination of presidential candidate and journalist Fernando Villavicencio.\n\nVillavicencio had reported receiving death threats from Fito just days before he was shot dead while leaving a campaign rally in Quito."}

They both grew up and have been neighbours for most their lives in the County Tyrone village of Galbally. They share a wicked sense of humour and, most notably, they both just turned 100 years old. \"It's nice surely to share such a big birthday with someone, especially a neighbour\", said Margaret McRory. Margaret was raised in Cappagh in County Tyrone and was the sixth of 12 children.\n\nShe said: \"It's a long time ago now, but I went to a school beside Cappagh village. \"Back then you were taught practical things, we learned how to sew, how to knit, how to wash clothes, by the time we left school, we could do it all.\" One of Margaret's proudest achievements is her ever-growing family; she currently has 29 grandchildren and 47 great-grandchildren. The centenarian said she likes to keep busy. She spent much of her time raising her large family while also helping out on her family farm. She added: \"Back then, they were simpler times surely. At home you had the turf fire always on the go and the pot and a pan on a crook over the fire, for boiling your spuds. \"And it was good enough for all of us, even the animals - the hen, the pigs, the whole lot, we all lived on spuds.\"\n\nElizabeth McKillion is pictured in the front row on the right with a white hat\n\nJust a few fields away from Maraget's home in Galbally, is where Elizabeth Hagan raised her family. A twin and the eldest of all her siblings, she initially went to school in Castlecaulfied. Lizzy, as she is known to family and friends, has fond memories of those school days. \"My school was just a short distance from the grounds of an old castle. It was a good place for me and my brother to hide the odd time instead of school\", Lizzy said. She added: \"One time word came to my daddy and he wanted to know why weren't at school and were climbing the walls of the castle. \"I told him I was only there to try and get my brother down because he was stuck, and my brother scolded me about it and I just laughed.\"\n\nElizabeth McKillion and Margaret McRory both received visits from the chair of Mid Ulster Council to mark their centenary celebrations\n\nAs of June last year the Northern Ireland Statistical Research Agency (NISRA) had a record of 290 people aged 100 and over living Northern Ireland, the majority being female.

She said: \"To be honest, I knew had a birthday coming up but I didn't even know it was 100 until someone pointed it out when they saw all my cards. \"I just laughed and said I thought someone had made a mistake and must have counted wrong.\" The birthday celebrations for both women have lasted weeks. It has included the chair of Mid Ulster Council paying them both a visit to present them with flowers, as well as letters from King Charles and the Irish President, Michael D Higgins, to mark the occasion But last week Tyrone's newest centenarians finally got to celebrate the occasion together when Lizzy visited Margaret at her home with both of their families.\n\nElizabeth and Margaret's close family recently got together to mark the occasion\n\nMargaret said she was delighted to see Lizzie in person because her home had always been a \"Céilí House\" where friends and neighbours would always visit. She added: \"Young people these days don't know what to 'go on your Céilí' means'- you'd go to someone's house and you could be there chatting all night. \"When I was young there were a few 'aul boys' that used to come to our house, sitting around the fire telling fairy stories, they would have stayed all night if you didn't chase them.\" While surrounded by friends and family at their joint party, both women were asked about the secret to reaching the grand age of 100. Margaret responded: \"Plenty of hard work, any amount of it, just live a good life and do whatever work you have to do, don't sit in the corner and look at it.\" Lizzy added: \"Just keep quiet and keep the head up.\""}

{"context": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's reported plans to visit Russia this month have caused concern among the US and its allies.\n\nHe and President Vladimir Putin intend to discuss the possibility of North Korea providing Moscow with weapons to support its war in Ukraine, US officials say.\n\nOn the surface, an arms deal between North Korea and Russia makes perfect transactional sense.\n\nMoscow desperately needs weapons, specifically ammunition and artillery shells, for the war in Ukraine, and Pyongyang has plenty of both.\n\nOn the other side, sanction-starved North Korea desperately needs money and food. More than three years of border closures, not to mention the breakdown of talks with the United States in 2019, have left the country more isolated than ever before.\n\nBut below the surface, it opens up the potential for Pyongyang and Moscow to start working more closely together. The US has been warning about a possible arms deal between the two countries for some time, but a leader-level meeting between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin catapults this into the next realm.\n\nWhile the priority for the US, certainly in the short-term, seems to be to stop North Korean weapons from getting to the frontline in Ukraine, the concern here in Seoul is over what North Korea would get in return for selling its arms to Russia.\n\nWith Russia in a desperate situation, Mr Kim will be able to extract a high price.\n\nPerhaps he could demand increased mi", "continuation": "litary support from Russia. Yesterday, South Korea's intelligence service briefed that Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had suggested Russia, China and North Korea hold joint naval drills, similar to those carried out by the US, South Korea and Japan, which Kim Jong Un so detests.\n\nMr Kim might also be able to call in Russian weapons in the future.\n\nBut by far the most worrying request Mr Kim could make is for Mr Putin to provide him with advanced weapons technology or knowledge, to help him make breakthroughs with his nuclear weapons programme. He is still struggling to master key strategic weapons, chiefly a spy satellite and a nuclear-armed submarine.\n\nHowever officials in Seoul believe cooperation on this level is unlikely, as it could end up being strategically dangerous for Russia.\n\nYang Uk, a research fellow at the Asian Institute for Policy Studies, noted that even if Russia doesn't sell North Korea weapons in return, it could still fund its nuclear programme. \"If Russia pays in oil and food, it can revive the North Korea economy, which in turn could then also strengthen North Korea's weapons system. It is an extra source of income for them that they didn't have.\"\n\nMr Yang, an expert in military strategy and weapons systems, added: \"For 15 years we've built up a network of sanctions against North Korea, to stop it from developing and trading weapons of mass destruction. Now Russia, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, could cause this whole system to collapse.\"\n\nAs sanctions have been ramped up, North Korea has become increasingly dependent on China to turn a blind eye to those violating sanctions and to provide it with food aid. For the past year Beijing has refused to punish North Korea for its weapons tests at the UN Security Council, meaning it has been able to develop its nuclear arsenal without serious consequence.\n\nNorth Korea provides Beijing with a useful buffer zone between itself and the US forces stationed in South Korea, meaning it pays to keep Pyongyang afloat.\n\nBut Pyongyang has always been uneasy about depending too much on China alone. With Russia on the hunt for allies, it gives Mr Kim the chance to diversify his support network.\n\nAnd with Russia so desperate, the North Korean leader may feel he can wrangle even greater concessions from Moscow than he can Beijing. Mr Putin might agree to keep silent in the face of a North Korean nuclear test, whereas this could prove a step too far for Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n\"During the Cold War, North Korea was playing the Russians off the Chinese, very similar to how children play parents off each other,\" said Dr Bernard Loo of the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\n\nBut there is still a question mark over whether the meeting will go ahead.\n\nMr Kim doesn't leave North Korea often or lightly. He is paranoid about his security and views trips abroad as fraught with danger. For his last international trips - to Hanoi to meet Donald Trump in February 2019, and to meet Mr Putin in Vladivostok in April 2019 - he rode on an armoured train. The trip to Hanoi took two long days through China.\n\nIt is unclear how private the two leaders intended their meeting to be, but it is possible the US is hoping that by making it public, it can spook Mr Kim and therefore thwart both the get-together and the potential arms deal.\n\nDr Loo doesn't think Mr Kim would have much wiggle room, however: \"Given the reports about three-way military exercises, it would be difficult to cancel these kinds of events without everyone ending up with egg on their face.\"\n\nPart of the US strategy since Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been to release intelligence to try to prevent deals from happening. North Korea and Russia have so far denied every suggestion they are looking to trade arms. Neither are likely to want this deal to be a public affair."}

They were convicted after a seven-week trial at Coventry Crown Court. Neighbours and relatives had repeatedly raised concerns about Abiyah but his parents became aggressive when challenged. On the front door of their home in Handsworth was a large sign that read \"no trespassing, access denied to all government bodies\".\n\nThe sign on the front door of their home in Handsworth, Birmingham\n\nThe couple claimed to have renounced their citizenship and did not consider themselves to be \"contracted\" to the state - in other words, they had withdrawn from society. Tai Yasharahyalah, a former medical genetics student before quitting the field, invented his own laws and claimed to have established his own kingdom. The couple styled themselves as “sovereign and indigenous members of the Kingdom of Yasharahyalah\". The cult had no other followers. It was just husband and wife; the latter of whom, according to police, was a devotee of her partner's ideology.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Police attempt to check on welfare of Abiyah\n\nThe pair, though, were at times not shy to share their views, letting police know a cornerstone of their philosophy. When officers visited in 2021 to carry out a welfare check on Abiyah, 42-year-old Tai Yasharahyalah yelled out: \"You have no jurisdiction in my realm... I don't have to engage with you because I am in my sovereign capacity.\" As he spoke, Abiyah was already dead and the police left without finding his makeshift grave. West Midlands Police has since said an \"unfortunate set of circumstances\" unfolded, with opportunities missed to intervene. A mix-up led officers to believe that Abiyah was legitimately absent from the property and in the care system. A Child Safeguarding Practice Review is under way to look at the involvement of police and other agencies in the case.\n\nNaiyahmi and Tai Yasharahyalah were described as dangerous by police\n\nDet Insp Joe Davenport from the force said: \"It’s incredibly harrowing to think of the medical evidence that we’ve heard at court, to think about how much pain Abiyah would have been in, and my heart goes out to Abiyah and the fact that there was opportunities to save him and he wasn’t saved.”\n\nThe makeshift grave where Abiyah was buried in the back garden\n\nA forensic archaeologist exhumed the body carefully but it was not possible to ascertain a cause of death\n\nBy the time the couple were arrested in December 2022, Abiyah had been dead two years. The pair had moved to Somerset and were living with another young child in a caravan. Conditions were squalid. The home was cold, dirty, cramped and had a foul stench of urine. There was no toilet - they used buckets instead. It was there - more than 100 miles away from Abiyah's makeshift grave - that a visiting social worker began to sense there was a terrible secret in the couple's recent past. And in exchanges that went on over the course of three days, a major disclosure was made about Abiyah's fate.\n\nThe couple were living in a caravan in Somerset in 2022 when they were arrested\n\nThe site where the caravan was situated was mainly inhabited by homeless people\n\nThe unravelling began when the social worker examined the couple's social media accounts, with videos discovered from 2016 in which Tai Yasharahyalah could be heard referring to a child called Abiyah. Naiyahmi Yasharahyalah, 43, was confronted about further images and video from October and December 2018 but she disengaged from conversation with authorities and refused to answer any questions. The following day, 8 December 2022, the same social worker spoke to Tai Yasharahyalah and asked him about posts that featured images of him with a young child, which had captions including \"like father like son\". It was then that he stated the child living with the couple in the caravan was Abiyah reincarnated, and that Abiyah was dead \"in a physical sense\". Those words led to the couple's arrests and soon after, Abiyah's body was discovered at the Birmingham property. Naiyahmi Yasharahyalah was heard shouting to officers when they came to detain her: \"I am not contracted to you, I renounce my citizenship.\"\n\nThe caravan was not fit for habitation by a young child, the court heard\n\nThe mother was described as \"skeletal\" and had difficultly moving. Her husband was weak too. \"They were in incredibly poor health themselves, which just shows they had continued to spiral downwards into this belief system, which was just driving them into the ground,\" Det Insp Davenport said. \"They lived completely separate to anyone who wasn’t a believer of their set of values and also as part of that they were strict vegans, and would only eat vegan food, as was the case for Abiyah as well, which has obviously led to his poor health. \"So, it’s just a very sad set of circumstances to think how he would’ve been in his final days at the point of his death.\"\n\nThe senior investigating officer Detective Inspector Joe Davenport said it was a sad and harrowing case for police to work on\n\nNaiyahmi Yasharahyalah described herself as being her husband's first disciple and had become completely enamoured by him, the court heard. He was seen in YouTube videos preaching around Birmingham city centre. \"She completely subscribed to his beliefs system,\" Det Insp Davenport explained. \"She said that she knew he was the love of her life the moment she met him.\" Tai Yasharahyalah was studying medical genetics at university when, because of online conspiracy theories, he rejected modern medicine. In his evidence to the court, he said that with hindsight \"I am completely ashamed\", and admitted he had been foolish to believe the theories. \"I felt overly protective. I thought I was doing the best for myself and my family,\" he told the jury. But police said he was arrogant and manipulative, while Naiyahmi Yasharahyalah was weak-minded and gullible. \"She has followed him willingly and has gone along with his ideology to the detriment of her own health and the health of her child,\" Det Insp Davenport said."}

They were Palestinian emigrants who had returned from Jordan a few years earlier with their mother and five siblings.\n\nThey had Israeli permits, allowing them to cross into Israel for agricultural work each day. These permits are often difficult to obtain and are rapidly withdrawn from anyone Israel sees as a security threat - or as linked to someone who is.\n\nThe three men killed with them were members of their extended family.\n\nPermits for two of the brothers, seen by the BBC, were issued in September 2023 and valid for several months.

There was nothing relating to the resistance - no bullets, no weapons. And there was no Israeli presence at all.\"\n\nArmed Palestinian groups - usually quick to claim any members killed by Israeli forces - have been silent about these seven men, with no statement describing any of them as \"martyrs\" for their cause.\n\nAt their funeral, their bodies were wrapped in the flags of Palestinian groups, including Hamas. The bodies of those killed by Israel are often wrapped in the flags of movements supported by friends or family members - even when the deceased are not supporters themselves.\n\nRelatives and neighbours all told us the men had no connection with militant groups - as did the head of Jenin's main hospital, Wissam Bakr, where the bodies were brought that morning.\n\nIbtesam Asous had not expected all four of her sons to die\n\n\"They are not armed, they are not fighters,\" he said. \"Normally, it's clear from the people if he's a fighter with one of the militant groups.

No, no, it's sure, all of them are civilians.\"\n\nIt was at the hospital that the men's mother, Ibtesam Asous, saw her sons' bodies.\n\n\"They were all gone,\" she said. \"I expected that one of them might have been martyred, but not all four of them. I was shocked when I saw that they had all been killed.\"\n\nWe asked the Israeli army to explain why this group of men was targeted.\n\nA spokesperson replied that soldiers had begun pursuing the \"terrorists who murdered an Israeli citizen\" and that the air strike targeted \"a terrorist squad that hurled explosives at the forces operating in the area, putting them in danger\".\n\nHours before the air strike in al-Shuhada, a 19-year-old border policewoman, Shai Germai, was killed when her vehicle hit an explosive device during clashes with Palestinian fighters in Jenin Camp.\n\nAfterwards, the army convoy withdrew from Jenin through al-Shuhada, where the Darweesh brothers had gathered with their three distant relatives, near an all-night coffee shop popular with agricultural workers and customers for the nearby dawn vegetable market.\n\nNight-vision drone footage provided by the IDF shows small flashes followed by an explosion as vehicles pass along the road - a heat pattern that could be produced by a petrol bomb. The video does not have a date-stamp or time-stamp.\n\nThe army also provided similar footage of its air strike on the location - but the two pieces of video are cut and edited together, making it impossible to tell how much time passed between them.\n\nWe asked the IDF to clarify the timings of both events. It replied that it would not be providing any more comment or information.\n\nThe timing is important, because of the circumstances needed under international law to justify using lethal force.\n\nThe UN's human rights body described the situation in the West Bank at the end of last year as \"alarming and urgent\".\n\n\"Israeli forces have increasingly used military tactics and weapons in law enforcement operations,\" a statement from its spokesperson said in November. \"Law enforcement is governed by international human rights law, which prohibits the intentional use of lethal force except when strictly necessary to protect life.\"\n\nIbtesam Asous, the men's mother, said she had seen a change in the methods used by Israeli forces in the West Bank since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October.\n\n\"They are acting just as they used to,\" she said. \"The only thing that changed is that, before, the army would shoot a guy in his leg. But now it's bigger - now they are bombing with rockets and killing as many people as they can.\"\n\nAccording to UN figures, last year was the bloodiest on record in the West Bank: 492 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces - 300 of them since the Hamas attacks in October, including 80 children.\n\nAlmost all were killed with live ammunition.\n\nTwenty-eight Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed in the West Bank by Palestinians last year - including three since the attacks in October, two of whom were soldiers.\n\nAttacks have also been carried out by Palestinians inside Israel, including one earlier this week that killed one woman and injured 17 other people.\n\nTwo witnesses who were in the coffee shop that morning told us that the army convoy left al-Shuhada between 04:00 and 04:45 local time (02:00-02:45 GMT), before the air strike took place, and that there were no clashes with local people.\n\n\"The soldiers passed four times and nobody approached them,\" one said. \"When the [vehicles] were fully outside the village, they bombed.

{"context": "One gun a day seized in London, Met Police says\n\nThe Met Police said 386 firearms had been recovered in the capital last year\n\nAbout one firearm is being seized from London’s streets every day, with gangs fuelling a \"vicious cycle of violence, involving money, drugs and firearms\", a Met Police commander has said. Cdr Paul Brogden said over half of shootings in the capital involve gangs or organised crime, with weapons being used to control territory or threaten those who owed money. Last month, a nine-year-old girl was left fighting for her life after a motorcyclist fired a number of shots towards a restaurant in Dalston, also injuring three men, aged 26, 37 and 42. Recent ONS figures showed there had been a rise in overall gun crime in London, from 1,009 offences in the year ending December 2022 to 1,208 offences in the same period last year.\n\nNevertheless, Cdr Brogden said since March 2023, \"lethal barrel discharge\", where a weapon is fired, is at its lowest level in 15 years - down from 196 to 145 recorded incidents over the same period the year before. Fatal shootings in London have also fallen over the last three years, from 15 homicides to nine last year. There were 29 homicides by shooting in England and Wales in the year to March 2023, a rise of one on the previous year, according to the ONS, external. In Scotland, just three people were killed this way in the same period.\n\nAlmost half of the firearms seized in London last year were converted guns, according to police\n\nEven so, several incidents over the last couple of years where bystanders have been injured in shootings have caused public concern. In March, two women were injured by shotgun pellets in Clapham, when a weapon was fired by a moped rider being pursued by police; and in January of last year, four women and two children were hurt when a sawn off shotgun was fired into a crowd of mourners in Euston who had been attending a memorial service. Referring to the shooting in Dalston, Cdr Brogdan said: “The likelihood of being a victim of gun crime in London is very low, but we do see wholly innocent victims who are caught in the cross fire.”\n\nHe explained that criminals were increasingly using converted guns, which were originally designed to fire blanks. Of the 386 firearms which were recovered in the capital last year, 46% of them were converted weapons. The blank-firing guns are o", "continuation": "ften sold legitimately to be used in drama productions or farming, but criminals are getting hold of them and illegally converting them into lethal weapons. She said: \"We need to talk about firearms a lot more. No one's talking about gun crime. Believe me gun crime is real.\"\n\nBut although the Met says it is bringing more people to justice for firearms offences with detection rates at their highest in 11 years, almost half of crimes last year did not lead to a prosecution. Det Supt Tim Mustoe said a key challenge was that many inquiries began with speaking to an injured gang member in hospital, who will not want any involvement with police. \"Fear and a lack of trust can be barriers for people to engage with us,\" he said. Cdr Brogden added that gathering intelligence and building the confidence of communities was an important part of tackling gun crime.\n\nDuring one police raid, a gun was found in a child's drawer\n\nOne offender who was jailed last year was 44-year-old Danny Butler. He was sentenced to 18 years after six guns, along with ammunition and drugs, were found at his home in Lambeth where he lived with his family, including an 18-month-old baby. Officers say they found three handguns, one of which was loaded, in a children's clothes drawer, and another handgun and pump action sawn-off shotgun in a cupboard. Det Supt Victoria Sullivan said when criminals try to hide weapons they often looked for someone who would not come to police attention, and who can be paid or pressurised to aid them. \"They pick vulnerable people within our communities and they take even more advantage of them. It's really sad to see,\" she said.\n\nDanny Butler was jailed last year after six guns were found at his home\n\nThe Met is currently facing a severe recruitment and funding challenge, which Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has warned is hampering its ability to tackle some crimes such as burglary and robbery. Earlier this month, he told the London Policing Board the force would prioritise tackling serious violence including violence against women and girls. It follows reports at the start of this year that homicide teams could face cuts to the number of detectives to address the recruitment shortfall and ensure that the most experienced officers were spread throughout the force. Nevertheless, Cdr Brogden said there had been no cuts and he was \"very happy\" with the resources to investigate homicide, adding the teams included \"highly experienced detectives\"."}
{"context": "Call to end abortion pills by post after poisoning\n\nStuart Worby poisoned the woman with abortion pills in 2022\n\nAn anti-abortion group has called for abortion medication to stop being accessible by post after a man was convicted of poisoning a woman with pills. Stuart Worby, 40, from Dereham, Norfolk, was jailed for 12 years for sexually assaulting the pregnant woman and giving her abortion medication. Right To Life UK wants the government to suspend the ability for people to be sent this medication by post, which was introduced during the Covid pandemic, in light of the case. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service said women needed to access safe abortions and should not be punished \"for the actions of abusive men\".\n\nMifepristone is one of two medicines used in the chemical abortion process\n\nWorby gave the woman mifepristone crushed up in a glass of orange juice. The next day he administered misoprostol during a sexual assault. The pills are commonly used together to terminate a pregnancy. They are usually given 24 hours apart and can be administered at home after a woman has had a consultation with a doctor. Worby's victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, suffered a miscarriage in hospital within hours of the assault, which happened in 2022. Worby obtained the medication from a friend, Neuza Cepeda, who posed as a woman in need of an abortion. After a phone consultation with a doctor at a London clinic, they sent her the medication. The pills-by-post scheme enables women who are less than 10 weeks pregnant to access abortion medication after a phone or video consultation with a doctor. It was introduced during the Covid pandemic to ensure women could continue to access terminations during early pregnancy. The scheme was made permanent in March 2022. Critics have said the removal of the requirement for an in-person medical appointment leaves the process open to abuse. Earlier this year, a cross-party group of MPs tabled an amendment, external to the Criminal Justice Bill to try to restore the pre-pandemic requirement for a face-to-face medical check before abortion medication could be prescribed.\n\nCatherine Robinson from Right To Life UK is worried it is too easy to access abortion medication by post\n\nRight To Life UK campaigns on issues such as abortion, assisted suicide and euthanasia. Catherine Robinson, a spokesperson for the group, has called on the government to end the ability to obtain abortion pills by post in light of the Worby case. \"If at-home abortions had not been introduced, Stuart Worby would not have been able to obtain these pills from this abortion provider, and this tragic case would not have happened. \"The woman involved would not have been poisoned and her baby would not have had his or her life ended.\" Cepeda obtained the medication from The Gynae Centre, a private women’s health clinic in London. The clinic has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment.\n\nThe Department for Health and Social Care said there were no plans to review the system. A spokesperson said: \"Our deepest sympathies are with the victim in this horrific case. \"It is crucial that women who choose abortion are able to do so safely, and the department works closely with NHS England, the Care Quality Commission and providers to ensure that abortions are provided legally and with robust clinical oversight.\" They added that women prescribed medication to terminate a pregnancy were warned that it was illegal to give it to anyone else.\n\nThe British Pregnancy Advisory Service pointed out the scheme to acquire abortion pills by post was safely used by tens of thousands of women every year. Heidi Stewart, the group's chief executive officer, said it was right Worby’s abuse of the system was punished but she defended the pills-by-post process. \"For anti-abortion groups to use this abuse, to call for the removal of confidential, accessible abortion care to thousands of women each year, is predictable and completely unsupported by evidence. \"Making abo", "continuation": "rtion harder to access would give the defendant and men like [Worby] more power and control over the most vulnerable women. \"Women should not be punished for the actions of abusive men.\"\n\nNueza Cepeda, 39, of Walnut Drive, Dereham, pleaded guilty to supplying medication to be used with intent to procure a miscarriage.

Manuel Guerrero Aviña, 44, was found guilty of being in possession of an illegal substance at a hearing in Doha and fined £2,100. His family say police planted drugs in his apartment and Mr Guerrero Aviña believes he was targeted by the sting because he is gay. Human rights group FairSquare called his trial a “travesty of justice” but Qatari officials insist the airline worker's arrest in February was solely due to drug offences.\n• None 'Qatar targeted my brother on Grindr - I want him home’\n\nMr Guerrero Aviña has called the verdict - which he is considering appealing - a human rights breach and says he was targeted because of his sexuality. He said: \"Although I welcome the fact that I can leave the country, I still condemn the unfair trial I have been subjected to and the torture and ill treatment I endured during my preliminary detention\". Mr Guerrero Aviña, an airline worker, said he is \"taking advice\" on his options. Qatari prosecutors have up to 30 days to appeal the sentence, meaning he can't leave the country immediately, even if he were to accept the verdict. James Lynch, co-director of human rights organisation FairSquare and former British diplomat in Qatar said the case was a \"travesty of justice.\" Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, but the family of Mr Guerrero Aviña say he had lived a normal life there for the past seven years and had never been in trouble with the authorities before. The case hit the headlines internationally when his family claimed he was targeted on gay dating app Grindr, after arranging to meet a man called \"Gio\". But he was instead met by police and arrested on drug charges, in what his family called a \"honeytrap operation\". After 42 days in a detention centre, Mr Guerrero Aviña was released on the condition he handed over his passport. He was forced to thumbprint a confession written in Arabic, without the help of a translator or access to a lawyer's advice, his family say. Qatari officials insist the 44-year-old's arrest was \"for possession of illegal substances on his person and in his apartment\" and that \"no other factors were taken into account\". They added that tests for illegal substances in his system had come back positive for amphetamine and methamphetamine. Amnesty International described the tests as \"questionable\" and not up to international standards.

The nurse featured prominently on leaflets and posters for the Countess of Chester Hospital's multimillion-pound Babygrow Appeal, which was launched in 2013. Giving evidence earlier at the Thirlwall Inquiry, the hospital's former chief financial officer Simon Holden said: \"There was various promotional material and leaflets and posters, and Lucy Letby appeared on quite a few of those. \"Nurse Letby was the face of that appeal in effect.\"\n\nLetby also provided a staff profile printed in the Chester Standard newspaper in the early weeks of the campaign, and two years later was pictured in the same newspaper with colleagues in August 2015 as they celebrated reaching the halfway target mark for the new, larger unit. She was moved from the unit in July 2016 to an administrative role at the hospital after consultant paediatricians voiced fears she may have deliberately harmed babies in the wake of the deaths of two triplet boys.\n\nLetby is serving 15 whole-life sentences for murdering seven babies and attempting to kill others\n\nMr Holden recalled that conversations about the charity appeal followed in meetings with hospital executives but he said Letby's name did not come up. He said: \"To be quite honest I didn't know who Lucy Letby was so I wouldn't put the face with the name at the time.\" He said it later became apparent that all the promotional documentation \"had Lucy Letby's picture on it\". In her staff profile, Letby, who started work full time at the neonatal unit from January 2012, told the Chester Standard: \"My role involves caring for a wide range of babies requiring various levels of support. \"Some are here for a few days, others for many months and I enjoy seeing them progress and supporting their families. \"I hope the new unit will provide a greater degree of privacy and space for parents and siblings.\" The replacement unit opened in 2021, although it will be relocated to a new women and children's building due to open next summer.\n\nLetby was moved from the neonatal unit in July 2016\n\nCheshire Police were not called in by the hospital until May 2017 to investigate the increased number of deaths on the unit after the hospital opted instead to commission a series of reviews.

The non-executive director said: \"For too long, the trust treated investigations into the increase in deaths too much like those in other mortality or serious incident reviews.

{"context": "Andrew and Tristan Tate are accused of human trafficking and sexually exploiting women\n\nA human trafficking case brought against controversial influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate cannot proceed to trial in its current form, a court in Romania has ruled. On Thursday, the Court of Appeals in Bucharest upheld a challenge from the brothers, sending the case back to prosecutors for further review. It is the second time the court has returned the case to prosecutors. The Tate brothers, aged 38 and 36, are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women. They have strongly denied the charges.\n\nIn November, the same court found \"irregularities\" in the indictment against them, requiring prosecutors to amend their brief. At the time, the court also removed several pieces of evidence, deeming some statements from alleged victims inadmissible. The brothers' successful appeal on Thursday marks another setback for prosecutors. They have accused the dual UK-US nationals of exploiting women via an adult content business which allegedly operated as a criminal enterprise. Two female Romanian associates were also named in the indictment published in June last year, which identified seven alleged victims. Andrew Tate is a self-described misogynist and was previously banned from social media platforms for expressing such views. The former kickboxer has gained millions of followers online, where he has often mixed political messages with showcasing a flashy lifestyle. He has been living in Romania for a number of years after previously being based in the UK. Following the ruling in his favour on Thursday he released a statement saying: \"They've had years to build their case - years to tear apart my life, target everyone I know, and even subpoena the mother of my child. And yet, they have nothing.\" He added: \"This is all a lie, and I will fight to the very end to expose it and prove my innocence.\" His brother Tristan said: \"If there isn't enough evidence to go to trial after all of these years, that means there never was enough evidence.\" Romania's public prosecutor's office, known as DIICOT, was yet to comment on the ruling.

And the AI essays \"verged on being undetectable\", with 94% not raising concerns with markers.\n\nThe 6% detection rate is likely to be an overestimate, according to the study, published in the journal Plos One. \"This is particularly worrying as AI submissions robustly gained higher grades than real student submissions,\" it said. \"Thus, students could cheat undetected using AI - and in doing so, attain a better grade then those who did not cheat.\" Associate Prof Peter Scarfe and Prof Etienne Roesch, who led the study, said their findings should be a \"wake-up call\" for educators around the world. Dr Scarfe said: \"Many institutions have moved away from traditional exams to make assessment more inclusive. \"Our research shows it is of international importance to understand how AI will affect the integrity of educational assessments. \"We won’t necessarily go back fully to handwritten exams - but the global education sector will need to evolve in the face of AI.\"\n\nIn the study, fake exam answers and essays were submitted for first-, second- and third-year modules, without the knowledge of those marking them.

Academics have raised concerns about the influence of AI in education, with Glasgow University recently reintroducing in-person exams for one course.

{"context": "Chip-maker Nvidia became the world’s most valuable company after its share price climbed to an all-time high on Tuesday. It is now worth $3.34tn (£2.63tn), with the price having nearly doubled since the start of this year. The stock ended the trading day at nearly $136, up 3.5%, making it more valuable than fellow tech giant Microsoft. It overtook Apple earlier this month. The Californian company's meteoric rise has been fuelled by its dominance of what analysts call the \"new gold or oil in the tech sector\" - the chips needed for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nSpeaking at an event in Copenhagen, Chris Penrose, global head of business development for telco at Nvidia, predicted further growth in the sector. “The generative AI journey is really transforming businesses and telcos around the world,\" he said. “We’re just at the beginning.” \"We believe over the next year the race to $4 trillion market cap in tech will be front and centre between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft,\" it said in a note earlier this week. Other commentators though have questioned whether there will be big future gains, given the increasing competition Nvidia faces.\n\nWhat is not in doubt though is how spectacularly it has grown. Eight years ago, the stock was worth less than 1% of its current price. Back then, Nvidia's value came from its competition with rival AMD, in a race to make the best graphics cards. In recent years though it has benefited from a boom in demand for chips that train and run generative AI models, the most well known of which being OpenAI's ChatGPT. The firm also benefitted significantly from a rush to mine cryptocurrency in 2020, which saw a sharp uptick in sales of its graphics cards. The rise and rise of the tech giant has been mirrored by the increasingly high profile of its boss, Jensen Huang. Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg even called the 61-year-old electrical engineer - known for his signature leather jacket - the \"Taylor Swift of tech\" for the celebrity status he has achieved. He's become well-known thanks in part to his popularity in his native Taiwan, where fans treat him as a rock star - posing for photos and even asking him to sign body parts.\n• None Why is Nvidia boss the 'Taylor Swift of tech'?\n\nCompetition among AI developers is fierce.

They made the call in an at times bad-tempered BBC Wales TV general election debate. Lib Dem Jane Dodds said the next Conservative or Labour government should abolish the benefits cap “because that is making families poorer\". Plaid’s Rhun ap Iorwerth said Sir Keir Starmer will be the next prime minister and he should lift the “cruel” policy.\n\nWelsh Labour leader Vaughan Gething said Sir Keir would “review” the benefits system and, for the Conservatives, Welsh Secretary David TC Davies said the welfare bill had “to come down”. The two-child cap, which was introduced in 2017, restricts child tax credit and universal credit to the first two children in most households. It means families cannot claim about £3,200 a year per extra child, the Resolution Foundation think tank has said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The next UK government was urged to end the two-child benefit cap, during the debate\n\nJane Dodds is leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, and their sole Senedd member. She told the studio audience, in Cardiff, that the price of fuel and food had gone up “twenty-five per cent in the last two years\". “One of the big factors is that here in Wales, 29% of our children are poor, 29% child poverty. \"And my challenge to the Conservatives and to Labour, if they're in power, is will you abolish the two child cap on our benefits because that is making our families poorer?\" “That is shameful in 2024,” she added. Vaughan Gething, First Minister and Welsh Labour leader, said that if Labour wins on 4 July it would review the benefits system, “to understand all of the different policies that have been visited on us, because we want a fairer deal for people”. “I am convinced that we’ll have a fairer benefits system that will help to support families into work and that will help to lift families out of poverty,” he said. “The last UK Labour government lifted over half a million children out of poverty. That's our record. That's our ambition.\"\n\nThere were lively exchanges between Vaughan Gething and David TC Davies\n\nPlaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth accused the first minister of \"refusing to engage with that most fundamental of changes that I think we need to see happening, which is the lifting of the cruel two-child benefits limit\". He said the cap had been \"imposed by the Conservatives and for some reason, given the principles that Labour used to stand for, promising to be continued by Labour\".\n\nReform UK’s Oliver Lewis said his party \"won't cut welfare\" but he was concerned that there was what he called a \"culture of benefit dependency”. He said “people need to work we need to offer a vibrant economy”. As Welsh secretary he is the most senior Conservative politician in Wales, and he defended his party's plans to cut £12bn from the UK's welfare bill. Mr Davies said there were “many people” who claimed sickness benefit who were capable of working. “They are not trying to deliberately milk the system” but he said “the vast majority” of them could be supported into employment.\n\nFour people linked to the prime minister are being looked into over allegations of betting on the date of the election, including the Conservative Party’s director of campaigning Tony Lee and a police officer in Mr Sunak's close protection team. Two Tory election candidates - Laura Saunders and Craig Williams - have confirmed they were being looked into by the Gambling Commission. Mr Williams is a Welsh Conservative and candidate in the Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr constituency – he has apologised for what he has called “an error of judgment”. In Friday's television debate, Mr Davies said he was “furious” about the election bets and insisted that he had not “made any bets whatsoever, and have not done for years”. He said that when he took over the Wales Office \"I realised there was a lot of unhappiness about general standards\". Mr Davies said he had ditched \"the ministerial car\" and stopped any alcohol being consumed or served on the premises. Pressed by Jane Dodds on whether the two candidates should be suspended, Mr Davies said: \"It's not my role to suspend people.\" \"This isn’t the sort of question I want, but you are right to ask it,\" he added.\n\nBoth Rhun ap Iorwerth and David TC Davies referred to the row surrounding Vaughan Gething’s £200,000 acceptance of a Labour leadership campaign donation.

{"context": "Police investigating crimes linked to the Post Office Horizon IT scandal are looking at \"dozens\" of potential suspects, but don't expect trials to begin until 2027. Police are investigating possible crimes by Post Office and Fujitsu employees and external lawyers, following the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of subpostmasters after faulty Horizon software said money was missing from their Post Office branch accounts. Three suspects have already been interviewed under caution and there are plans to interview others next year, according to police. But no one will be charged until officers have read the final report from the separate public inquiry, almost 30 years after concerns were first raised.\n\nLee Castleton, a sub-postmaster from Bridlington, near Hull, who was bankrupted in 2004 after losing a two-year battle with the Post Office over Horizon, said: \"I can't understand why it's taken so long, I can't understand why things are having to be gone over and over and over... But you know, never give in, we'll get there.\" Former sub-postmistress Seema Misra was wrongly found guilty of theft and false accounting in 2010, and sent to prison while eight-weeks pregnant. She welcomed the update on the criminal investigation as \"a step forward\", adding that \"at least things are going in the right direction now – hopefully.\" She said it had already been a long wait for her and other victims of the scandal, which she described as having \"taken its toll\". \"Did we expect it to take this long? No,\" she said. \"We wanted it to be done sooner, rather than later.\" The first media reports of Horizon problems were published by Computer Weekly in 2009. Alan Bates and his fellow sub-postmasters' won the first of their two High Court victories in March 2019, eight years before the first criminal trials are set to begin. Some 100 officers from around England and Wales are now working on what they've called Operation Olympos, which began in 2020. The investigation will be led by the Metropolitan Police in London, while Police Scotland, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and National Crime Agency are also involved. Commander Stephen Clayman said the scale of the investigation was \"unprecedented\". \"We have got, we think, over 3,000 people affected in some way, by Horizon. So it's huge and we have got to put in a commensurate number of officers, to start moving it at pace,\" he said. The first phase of the investigation will focus on those making \"key decisions\" on investigations and prosecutions, looking at possible offences of perjury and the serious offence of perverting the course of justice. A second phase will cast the net wider, potentially taking in senior post office executives. Work is already underway on building some of the cases, and police are in regular dialogue with the Crown Prosecution Service. The first trials may involve cases from either phase, police said, but timescales and the numbers of potential suspects could change as more evidence is gathered. Officers are already working with 1.5 million documents in the case and expect this number to grow.

{"context": "Government borrowing fell in November as more money was raised from taxes and less was spent on the country's debt interest payments, according to official figures. Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax take - was £11.2bn last month, the lowest November figure since 2021, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Separate figures from the ONS showed retail sales rose slightly last month, helped by stronger trading at supermarkets. The latest figures come as economic growth in the UK remains weak and inflation - the rate at which prices increase over time - is rising at its fastest pace since March.\n\nNovember's borrowing figure was down by £3.4bn from the same month last year and below expectations of around £13bn. It means the total amount the government has borrowed since the start of the current financial year stands at £113.2bn. This is below the same period last year, but £2bn above predictions by the government's forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Debt interest was down £4.7bn from a year earlier to £3bn, mainly due to lower inflation. Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said November borrowing \"undershooting\" expectations meant \"Christmas has come early\" for Chancellor Rachel Reeves. But she ad", "continuation": "ded while the chancellor would be encouraged by the latest figures, weakening in the UK economy meant there was a growing chance of further tax hikes or spending cuts. Dennis Tatarkov, senior economist at KPMG UK, added the government had some \"temporary respite\" due to lower interest repayments, but warned the trend was \"unlikely to last as actual and projected inflation has moved up in recent months\". Retail sales rose 0.2% in November after a 0.7% fall in October, but a rise in sales at supermarkets was partly offset by a fall in clothing sales, the ONS said. However, its latest survey period did not cover the official Black Friday date of 29 November.\n\nThe latest economic figures come after the Bank of England voted to hold interest rates on Thursday, stating it thought the UK economy had performed worse than expected, with no growth at all between October and December. The Bank downgraded its growth forecast from 0.3% for the final three months of 2024, to zero growth. The growth revisions were seen as a blow to Labour, which has made growing the economy its top priority. Other figures released this week showed inflation hit 2.6% in the year to November, above the Bank's 2% target. Responding to the latest borrowing figures, Darren Jones, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said the government had \"inherited crumbling public services and crippled public finances\" when it entered power. \"Now we have wiped the slate clean, we are focused on investment and reform to deliver growth,\" he said. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said lower November borrowing was \"good news\", but added \"the bigger picture remains deeply troubling\". She said people were \"still feeling the pain of the previous Conservative government's economic mismanagement\", but added the new Labour administration needed \"a far better plan to turn things around\". At the Budget the chancellor changed the government's self-imposed debt rules in order to free up billions for infrastructure spending, which she said would drive economic growth and create jobs. \"What will worry government is that recent economic indicators such as weak [economic] growth and rising inflation are flashing amber,\" said Alison Ring, director of public sector and taxation at the ICAEW trade body for accountants. \"Money remains extremely tight and that is unlikely to change any time soon.\"\n\nThe rebound in retail sales in November was slightly lower than expected, with sales on course to decline overall in the year. Sales were a mixed bag, according to Capital Economics, with supermarkets up but department and clothing stores down \"as households continued to delay spending on winter clothing\". Nick Stowe, chief executive of Monsoon Accessorize, said retailers had \"seen quite soft demand\" due to low consumer confidence, hitting clothes shops."}
{"context": "Is the Dull Men's Club actually... quite interesting?\n\nIn New York City, sometime in the late 1980s, a group of friends sat in a bar near Central Park and flicked through a magazine. One man, after looking at the stories of boxing, wrestling, and judo, turned to his friends and said, with some regret: \"We don't do any of those things.\" Almost 40 years later, on a coach on the M40 in England, a different man opened a Mars bar. When he noticed the bar was smooth, rather than rippled, he posted a picture on Facebook. The post was picked up by the media – including the BBC – and the story of the unusually-smooth chocolate was read by millions of people around the world. The friends in Manhattan, and the man with the Mars bar, do not know each other - but they are linked by a trans-Atlantic thread. Their stories mark the founding, and perhaps the high point, of a growing fellowship: the Dull Men's Club.\n\nGrover Click, the head of the group, is officially the \"assistant vice president\" of the Dull Men's Club - a title chosen for its dullness\n\nGrover Click, now 85, was one of those friends in the New York bar in the 1980s. \"When my friend said 'we don't do any of those things', someone else said: 'We're kind of dull, aren't we?' So I said: 'OK - let's start a club for us dull men.'\" The club began as a joke. They raced lifts (or elevators) to see which was fastest, and once organised a bus tour that started and finished in Manhattan, without going anywhere in between. \"We walked round the outside and the driver explained tyre pressures,\" Grover remembers. \"Silliness like that.\" In 1996, after Grover moved to England, his nephew offered to build a website for \"that silly Dull Men's Club\". And from there, says Grover, \"it kind of morphed, and has really caught on now\". Grover's Dull Men's Club Facebook group – it's the one with the copyright symbol in the title, there are copycats – now has 1.5 million members. On it, men and women of all ages celebrate their observations and obsessions, without fear of ridicule (ridicule is against the rules, as is politics, religion, and swearing). Posts this week include praise for the £2 coin design; before and after pictures of brass instrument repair; and how long it takes to fill a water bottle. One person comments: \"Every morning at work I refill my water bottle and it takes 47 seconds… sometimes I close my eyes and count to 47.\" But the Dull Men's Club is more than just a Facebook page: it also has a newsletter, a calendar, real-life meet-ups, and awards – including the coveted Anorak of the Year, for the truly dedicated dullster (Grover prefers dullster – \"The opposite of hipster,\" he says – to dullard).

He takes pictures of potholes with plastic ducks in.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nTim started taking his pictures in January last year, after a pothole in his area wasn't repaired properly. \"I had a word with a council official, and he recommended that I look at the manifesto of the Monster Raving Loony Party from 2017. In there, it says residents should highlight potholes with plastic ducks – seriously, this is true. And I thought, OK, I'll put plastic ducks in potholes.\" After taking the pictures (for safety reasons, he works at quiet times and takes a friend to help) he sent them to the council, and posted them on a local Facebook group. Encouraged by the feedback, he progressed from plastic ducks to other visual jokes. \"I put a toad in a pothole – not a real toad – and wrote: 'This is my favourite Sunday dish.' And people either get it or they don't.\" Tim does not know how many potholes he has photographed – he guesses 100 to 150 – but now the pothole art is the \"interesting bit\" of his campaign. The dull bit, he admits, is his spreadsheet of every road defect in the borough, which allows him to chase up repairs. \"There are about 2,500 entries on there,\" he says. Grover encouraged Tim to join the Dull Men's Club after seeing the pothole pictures online. Tim did so, and was happy to accept the Anorak of the Year award in the good-natured spirit in which it was offered. But for Tim, there is a serious side to his hobby, even if it could seem… well, less glamorous than others. \"I don't do it for money or fame,\" he says. \"I do it because I want to make a difference to my community.\" It's an outlook shared by the Dull Men's Club Anorak of the Year from 2021 – who, it turns out, is neither dull, nor a man.\n\nRachel Williamson with some of her supplies\n\nIn 2020, during the first Covid lockdown, Rachel Williamson was looking at a socially-distanced queue outside a chemist in her hometown of Rhyl in Denbighshire. \"My twin sister joined the queue.

And I just wondered – could I put a sparkly hat on the post box to make this queue smile?\" Although Rachel – a 61-year-old retired police detective – had knitted since she was a girl, she couldn't crochet. With little else to do in lockdown, she tried, and within two days had a sparkly hat for the post box outside the chemist. Another one, for the box outside the Post Office, soon followed. \"My sister went in the Post Office and she said: 'Nobody's talking about Covid any more, they're talking about the post box topper outside the door.'\" She has since topped more than 300 post boxes, and made countless other decorations for the community. She does requests from elsewhere in the UK – \"I've sent one to Scotland, one to Nantwich [in Cheshire]\" – and local people chip in with supplies. \"My living room is full of wool,\" she says. \"I don't know where the Christmas tree is going to go.\" During lockdown, Rachel's toppers featured in a charity book and calendar, which brought her to the attention of the Dull Men's Club. So how does it feel for a woman to be i", "continuation": "nvited to such a club? \"I'd never heard of it, but I felt very privileged,\" she says. Yet despite being an Anorak of the Year, is Rachel's hobby even dull? Is it not colourful, life-enhancing, even - dare we say - quite interesting? \"I've got three grown-up sons, and when they come round, all I talk about is my knitting,\" she says. \"I am the dullest person on the planet to them. I've gone from a fast-moving detective to fluff and stuff.\"\n\nRachel posts her creations - including this festive effort - on the Dull Men's Club Facebook group\n\nLike Tim, Rachel has found purpose in her (arguably) dull hobby. \"After 18 years in the police, it has restored my faith in people. The people of Rhyl have been absolutely great. And we've made lots of people smile.\" She picked up her Anorak of the Year award in a ceremony in a pub near Llangollen. \"The people who haven't got hobbies are the dull people.\" says Rachel. It's a realisation that also came to Grover Click – the original Dull Man – while compiling the club's calendar, decades after that first conversation in the New York bar. \"We started writing about these people and thought it was kind of funny,\" he says. \"But then you see these guys are onto something. They've got their act together.\" To sum it up, Grover points to his foreword to the 2024 Dull Men's Club calendar. \"What they [the dull men] are doing is referred to in Japan as ikigai,\" he writes. \"It gives a sense of purpose, a motivating force. A reason to jump out of bed in the morning.\""}

{"context": "Labour would need an effective opposition, says Hunt\n\nIf Labour wins the general election it will need an \"effective opposition\" in Parliament, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has told the BBC. Mr Hunt is the latest senior Conservative to publicly acknowledge his party could be on course for defeat. He urged people not to vote for Reform UK, claiming this would result in fewer centre-right MPs. Earlier, Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride said opinion polls suggested Labour was heading towards \"the largest majority virtually in the history of this country\". And last week Grant Shapps urged voters not to give Labour a \"supermajority\", with the party's power \"unchecked\". With the Tories losing support to Reform, senior figures have repeatedly warned that backing Nigel Farage's party would split the centre-right vote, benefiting Labour. Rishi Sunak insists he is still fighting to win. Privately, many Conservative candidates are fairly open about their belief that victory is implausible and that their party should instead hope to limit the scale of a Labour victory. However, it is only in this last week senior Tories have publicly raised this prospect in an apparent change of strategy.\n\nIn an interview with BBC economics editor Faisal Islam, Mr Hunt was asked if talk of a Labour \"supermajority\" on 4 July was an implicit acknowledgement that the Tory campaign had gone badly wrong. \"I think it's very important if Labour win, that they have an effective opposition in Parliament,\" he said", "continuation": ".

Despite nearly three years of war, life here can seem so normal: from the crowds of commuters on the Metro to the bars and clubs packed with young Muscovites. Then, suddenly, something happens to remind you: there is nothing normal about Russia today. That \"something\" can be a Ukrainian drone penetrating Moscow's air defences. Or - even more dramatic - what happened on Tuesday morning: the targeted assassination of a senior Russian general as he walked out of an apartment block.\n\nWhen Lt Gen Igor Kirillov and his assistant Ilya Polikarpov were killed by a bomb concealed on an electric scooter, the reality of Russia's war on Ukraine hit home.

Astonishing, really, considering the large number of dead and wounded. But the killing of a Russian general in Moscow: that is a definite wake-up call; proof that this war is very real and very close to home. Will it serve as a wake-up call for the Russian authorities? Probably not. There is little sign of a Kremlin U-turn on Ukraine. Moscow is far more likely to intensify the war. Reacting to news of Kirillov's killing, the host of a political talk show on Russian state TV blamed Ukraine and claimed that \"with this attack President Zelensky has signed his own death sentence\".

Warm, wet conditions have prevailed this year and that has brought problems too, the Trust says in its annual roundup of how the weather and climate has affected its vast holdings of land and property.

Charity The Butterfly Trust says only 333 examples of this dramatic creature were recorded in one area of west Dorset – a stronghold of the species – compared to 1,459 in 2023. Many bee, wasp and moth species also recorded very low numbers. \"Our unpredictable weather is resulting in confusion for our wildlife and the slow loss of what once were 'predictable' seasons,\" said Keith Jones, the Climate Change Advisor at the National Trust.\n\nWicken Fen is one of the best places in the country to see dragonflies, with 22 species recently recorded on the fen\n\nThe rainy weather helped re-wet peatland ecosystems across the country after two years of very dry weather in 2022 and into 2023. Rare dragonflies were sighted on various bogland ecosystems, including this female Scare Chaser dragonfly at Wicken Fen in Cambridgeshire. Many trees benefited too.

The King said their efforts to end \"brutal totalitarianism\" must never be forgotten. And he called on the present generation to honour those who had died, in ways that \"live up to the freedom they died for, by balancing rights with civic responsibilities\". Prince William delivered a poignant reading from the diary of Captain Alastair Bannerman, in which the soldier remembered his family as he headed towards the French coast on the morning of D-Day.

Georgescu, whose only election campaigning has been on social media, said he would make \"the Romanian people\" his priority. But he denied that his surprise success so far was the result of a Russian-backed influence operation, saying he did not care about the \"lies\" of his country's intelligence agencies as he was working with God and the people.\n\nOn Wednesday, in a highly unusual move, Romania's outgoing president published declassified documents that detailed what was called a massive and \"highly organised\" campaign for Georgescu on TikTok co-ordinated by a \"state actor\". The papers included an intelligence assessment that Russia was carrying out hybrid attacks on Romania, which it sees as an \"enemy state\". The constitutional court is now being flooded with requests to look into the allegations of meddling with a view to possibly cancelling the election. Prosecutors today announced they were opening a criminal investigation but there is no timeline on when that might conclude. \"They are afraid,\" is how Georgescu brushed away evidence that hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent pushing campaign content for him, breaking both Romanian election law and TikTok's own rules. He denied that he was \"Moscow's man\", referring derisively to Romania's \"un-intelligence agencies\". \"They can't accept that the Romanian people finally said, 'we want our life back, our country, our dignity',\" he said, portraying himself as battling against an unyielding establishment. In a sometimes tetchy interview in which he praised Donald Trump and the Hungarian populist leader Viktor Orban, Georgescu referred to Vladimir Putin as a \"patriot and a leader\". He then added: \"But I am not a fan.\" But when questioned about Russia's war on Ukraine, he first asked, \"Are you sure of that?\", appearing to deny the war's very existence. He then said Romania was interested only in pushing for peace on its border but refused to say that this should be on Kyiv's terms. When asked whether he agreed with standing by Ukraine, as the EU puts it, \"for as long as it takes\", Georgescu said \"No.\" He said things would change. \"I agree just that I have to take care of my people. I don't want to involve my people,\" he replied, clarifying that Romania – an EU and Nato member - would provide no more military or political support for its neighbour. \"Zero. Everything stops. I have to take care just about my people. We have a lot of problems ourselves.\" It would be a dramatic change in position for Bucharest, and one that would be music to Russian ears. The president in Romania has considerable power, including influence on areas such as foreign policy. He is also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and appoints the prime minister. Romania shares a long border with Ukraine and has been a staunch supporter of Kyiv since the full-scale invasion in 2022. It's provided a Patriot missile defence system as well as financial support. It's also become a key export route for Ukrainian grain, as Russian bombardments have crippled the work of ports there. Under a Georgescu presidency, Romania would join Hungary and Slovakia as Russia-sympathisers on the eastern flank of Nato. It would also be a serious dent to EU solidarity on Ukraine, just as it faces the prospect of assuming more responsibility for aiding Kyiv with Donald Trump back in the White House. Georgescu underlined that he would keep Romania inside the EU and Nato, but that everything from now on would be \"negotiated\" and focus on his country's interests. He refused to say that Vladimir Putin's Russia was a security threat for the West. His endorsement of conspiracy theories has also sparked concerns, including denying the Covid pandemic and doubting that anyone ever landed on the Moon. Romania is home to a giant Nato military base, close to the Black Sea, as well as a US missile defence facility. Georgescu now describes himself as a university teacher, but has previously worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and with the UN. He clearly does have supporters – his clean-living, Romania-first message has popular appeal, especially outside Bucharest. But in the capital many people are worried about the direction their country may be taking. When asked if he understood why they were scared, Georgescu shook his head: \"That's just propaganda.\" On Thursday evening, several thousand protesters gathered in central Bucharest to call for Romania to remain closely allied with Europe - many holding the blue EU flag. Others brought Romanian flags with a circular hole in the centre, a reminder of how after the 1989 revolution people cut out the communist symbols. Talk of Russian influence - Moscow meddling in any form - is an emotional topic for many. Several chanted \"Freedom!\" and \"Europe!\" One man told the BBC he and his friends had been with protesters on the streets of Bucharest 35 years ago, and couldn't bear to think of Romania going back to the past. Another woman, Anca, said she saw the \"long arm of Russia\" at work in Romania's presidential election and had come to the rally to show she believes her country's future has to be firmly in Europe."}

It's about economic growth as well. You've got this tremendous heritage here and obviously talent, as we saw this afternoon,\" he said on Tuesday.\n\n\"So, putting those two things together, the future's astonishingly bright, I think.\"\n\nPupils got to experiment with lasers, concrete, lightweight engineering materials and radio-controlled cars, as ways of showing them the wider applications of the Steam subjects.\n\nFreya from St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena was among the students who took part in the event\n\nFor Freya, from St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena, experimenting with lasers was a new experience.\n\n\"It's made me think a lot more about these different career paths you can do in your science in general,\" she said.\n\nHarry, from Dunclug College, enjoyed learning new skills through building a brush monster, saying he was \"getting better at teamwork and just working stuff out\".\n\nThe arts are", "continuation": " a recent addition to the Stem family, and one that Prof Cox is delighted to see, as someone who still performs as a musician.\n\n\"You don't find meaning through the eyepiece of the telescope,\" he said.\n\n\"Science, yes; engineering, yes; but also art and literature or music, philosophy. All those human disciplines are ultimately necessary but not sufficient attempts to understand what it means to be human, so they go together in my mind.\n\n\"My life has been a mixture of the two. I think everybody's life is a mixture of all these different ways of thinking and so it's wrong in education to try and separate them into different lives.\"\n\nThe need for continuing curiosity and learning is something he hopes the students take away from the Science Summer School initiative.\n\n\"That's part of today. In order to find challenge - intellectual challenge, difficulty - in order to find that exciting, you have to have some confidence and so part of today is to give the students confidence.\n\nSome students got to work on an engineering project\n\n\"They've got their curiosity and they've got the ability, we saw that, and the questions they asked - they've got everything they need.\n\n\"What they might not have, potentially, is just that they might not quite see the road, how to do it or where to go. So that's really why these events are so important.\"\n\nWith the effects of climate change becoming ever more apparent, the industries that supported the Science School event are turning to the Steam subjects to help make their processes greener.\n\nAnd there's one other step Prof Cox thinks would help address the climate emergency the world is facing.\n\n\"All elected leaders should be launched into space,\" he said.\n\n\"The majority of them should be brought back again. But the reason is so they can see the planet for which they have responsibility.\"\n\nThey say you shouldn't meet your heroes, but perhaps rules are made to be broken after all.\n\nThe last time I saw Prof Brian Cox in person he was playing the keyboard as part of 90s pop band D:Ream as the crowd danced in the Ulster Hall.\n\nFast forward, well, a few years, and we talked about the infinite possibilities of an ever-expanding universe and the importance of ascribing meaning through art and philosophy to the discoveries of science.\n\nThe young people there asked all sorts of questions; some fun - what's your least favourite area of science? (Answer: he loves them all and is discovering biology now).\n\nAnd other more practical - how quickly is the universe growing? (Answer: increasingly rapidly).\n\nI like to believe I'm not the only person who walked away feeling a little spark of hope for the planet.\n\nPerhaps things really can only get better…"}

Speaking to Reuters, Baldwin Chia said he was concerned about avalanches but hadn't received reports of any taking place.\n\nHe said it was common to hear about earthquakes in Japan, but \"you wouldn't expect to actually experience one\".\n\nAndy Clark, a Briton in Japan, described to the BBC a \"scary afternoon and evening\", as he was in the affected coastal city of Toyama when the quake hit.\n\nHe said he \"grabbed the sea wall to stay upright\" before heading to a school roof for safety. Mr Clark said it was proving \"hard to get some sleep\" due to the aftershocks.\n\nJeffrey Hall, a lecturer at Kanda University, said he felt tremors for about two minutes despite being in Yokohama, on the other side of Japan's main island. He told the BBC the quake was \"very, very serious\".\n\nResidents in central Japanese towns and cities were forced to move into shelters for the night\n\nThe full extent of the damage is unlikely to be clear until Tuesday morning, but major damage to infrastructure is evident.\n\nOfficials in Suzu City in Ishikawa prefecture said several houses and power poles collapsed, according to national broadcaster NHK.\n\nMajor highways were closed near the quake's epicentre and more than 36,000 households were left without power, according to utilities provider Hokuriku Electric Power.\n\nThe BBC's former Japan correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes - who was reporting from Taiwan - said several hundred metres of the main expressway between the cities of Toyama and Kanazawa had been ripped apart by a landslide.\n\nVideo from Uchinada, also in Ishikawa prefecture, showed the surface of a road rippled and cracked.

The constant threat of earthquakes has led Japan to develop one of the world's most sophisticated tsunami warning systems.\n\nThere are several nuclear power plants in the affected areas, however Japan's nuclear authority said there was \"no risk of radioactivity leaking\" from the facilities.\n\nSouth Korea's meteorological agency and Russia also issued tsunami warnings after the earthquake.\n\nThe 9.0-magnitude earthquake which hit Japan in 2011 resulted in a tsunami - which tore through the country's north-eastern coastal communities, killing almost 18,000 people and displacing tens of thousands.\n\nThose tsunami waves triggered a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima power plant, causing the most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl.\n\nAre you in the affected area?

The 35-year-old rapper and director has created a new Netflix sci-fi series about five black south Londoners who unexpectedly gain superpowers. At the London premiere, Rapman, real name Andrew Onwubolu, jokes that he wishes he could have the power of teleportation given that he almost turned up late to his own event. He says that the inspiration behind the show, titled Supacell, was \"being a massive fan of the superhero genre but never feeling that it was realistic to the world I live in\". \"You might think these genres don't mix but when you see it, you think, yeah this is what it would be like if Londoners had superpowers.\"\n\nCalvin Demba plays Rodney, a wheeler dealer who develops the power of superspeed\n\n\"The show is about five ordinary people doing extraordinary things,\" explains Tosin Cole, who plays lead character Michael. Michael is on his own personal mission to bring the other four - Tazer, Rodney, Sabrina and Andre - together for a crucial mission. The five have never met but now must join forces in order to save his fiancee, Dionne (Adelayo Adedayo), from dying. Cole, who most recently starred in Doctor Who as companion Ryan Sinclair, says that above all of the superpowers, \"love is the most important as it forces people to do things they would have never imagined\".\n\nThe five characters from south London all develop superpowers at the same time\n\nOne distinct feature about Supacell is that most of the cast, and those behind the camera, are black. Michael Salami, one of the supporting actors, tells the BBC that working on the set \"was so different to any other project\". \"Normally I have to tame my blackness and who I am, but here I didn't have to change a single aspect of myself and didn't have to worry about anything.\" He also explains that usually there is a problem with hair and make-up not catering to black people. \"It's so bad that I've learnt to cut my hair because no one on set knows how to treat our hair but here it wasn't like that.\" Nadine Mills, plays NHS nurse Sabrina, who develops the power of telekinesis. She also says the difference in hair and make-up on set was \"incredible\". \"They know how to work with your hair texture, your complexion and so really it made coming to work that bit more enjoyable.\"\n\nSabrina is the only character out of the five that doesn't want to have a superpower\n\nReviews of Supacell have been generally positive - Empire awarded the show four stars, external and called it \"an impressively unpredictable show pulsating with vitality and urgency\", while The Telegraph said, external it \"combines Top Boy and Misfits\" and also gave it four stars. The Hollywood reporter said, external \"the way it feels and plays out is completely distinctive\" from other superhero films. \"The genre is the genre, but the tone and feel that Rapman sets and the characters he builds out are different enough to be worthwhile,\" Daniel Fienberg wrote.\n\nMuch like Rapman's 2019 postcode-war thriller, Blue Story, which delved into London gangs, Supacell doesn't shy away from tackling some big issues, one of which is sickle cell disorder. It may seem that a south London superhero film is an unlikely place for a storyline on a blood disorder, but Rapman wanted to \"do something empowering\". There are about 17,000 people living with sickle cell disorder in England, with some 250 new cases diagnosed each year. It is more common in people of Black African and Caribbean heritage. \"It's something that has always affected our community and I never understood it,\" explains Rapman. \"I wanted to show how a disease like this can make you extraordinary\". Grime artist Ghetts plays one of the supporting actors in Supacell and said he wanted to be part of the show because of how sickle cell is dealt with.\n\nGhetts and Digga D both have cameos in Supacell\n\n\"Rapman shows that having this disease can be a superpower and that's what made me so emotionally attached to the script,\" he says. The 39-year-old artist says it was \"amazing\" to turn his hand to acting and on set he wasn't \"Ghetts the rapper, but someone who was there to just learn and be a sponge\". Rapman's attempt to create a realistic portrayal of south London meant that he had to show \"the good and the bad\" which included gang violence. \"It's a show about south London and to not include the gang violence I wouldn't be true to myself or to the south London I know,\" he says. One of the five characters with superpowers, Tazer, is a teenager involved in a gang.\n\nRapman says that for most of his life growing up in south London he \"only saw Tazer's world\" of knife crime and violence\n\nJosh Tedeku, who plays Tazer, tells the BBC he was conscious not to glorify the knife crime, but ultimately \"the way the script is written is in a way that it can't be taken positively as it really shows the brutal nature of being able to take someone's life and the impact of that\". \"But it is real and part of this show is telling stories that are real,\" he adds. And that is the ultimate point of Rapman's show - the superpowers bring the fantasy element, but Supacell is about real people with real hopes, experiences and problems."}

The prime minister defended changes to farmers' inheritance tax, hikes to business taxes and cuts to winter fuel payments in 90 minutes of questions. Labour \"had to do tough stuff\" to stabilise the public finances after being left an \"awful\" inheritance from the Conservatives, he said.

Earlier this month, he announced an additional target to improve living standards, leading to some accusations he was moving the goalposts on what he wanted his government to be judged by. But in his first appearance before the liaison committee of senior MPs since entering office, Sir Keir insisted he was still committed to getting the UK growing faster other G7 members, such as the US, Germany and Japan, by 2029. When it was pointed out to him that economic forecasts suggested this was not going to happen, he said they had not taken some future policy changes into account. He cited a rise to the legal minimum wage, announced at October's Budget, as an example of how ministers were boosting living standards. He added that changes to the planning system, other \"regulations\" and new technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) would also help improve the UK's economic growth rates.\n\nBut the prime minister faced sustained questioning from the select committee chairs over policies decisions that have not gone down well with the opposition and, in some cases, his own MPs.

{"context": "Welsh tuition fees to rise by nearly £300 a year\n\nThe rise is in line with an increase in England but it is the second time fees have gone up in a year\n\nUniversity fees in Wales are set to rise to £9,535 a year - nearly a £300 increase - from September 2025. The Welsh government announcement brings tuition costs in Wales in line with a hike in fees already announced by the UK government for universities in England. It is the second increase in charges for Welsh courses within a year, after the maximum charge went up from £9000 to £9250 from September 2024. Vikki Howells, minister for further and higher education, said it was a \"difficult but necessary decision\".\n\nMs Howells said the decision would not increase the up front costs of university for students and would not increase their monthly repayments as graduates. A 1.6% increase to maintenance support for undergraduates was also announced. The maximum amount of support for postgraduate study will also increase by 1.6%, with the same level of increase in grants for students with dependants and those with a disability.\n\nMs Howells said raising fees was necessary \"to ensure Welsh higher education institutions remain competitive with those in other parts of the UK\". \"I want to be clear that this small increase in fees should not dissuade anyone from Wales considering applying for university next year,\" she said. She added there would be an extra £20m in funding for Medr, external, which funds post-16 education, to support further and higher education.\n\nStudent at Gower college, Sophia, 16, from Swansea, said she wasn't pleased with the increase as \"parents struggle with money as it is\". She said parents wouldn't want to take the dream of going to university away from their child because of additional financial pressures. Sophia says the increase would see people needing to juggle jobs to be able to afford it which will \"100% put people off going\". \"To have your dreamed crushed by money, it's going to be a struggle for a lot of people.\" she added.\n\nStudent Sophia said things are difficult enough as they are so the rise may see people put off going to University\n\nBut 17-year-old Ella from Swansea, who is also a student at Gower college, was unsure if she would st", "continuation": "ruggle to balance costs in university. \"I don't know if I would have to get a part time job to help with that but it's not easy as student,\" she said.

Gareth Lloyd from UCU Cymru said they welcome the additional in-year funding for universities and colleges as they are \"suffering from an increased workload.\" In a statement, he added: \"We need to acknowledge that the crisis in our universities can only be resolved through a new system of UK funding which equitably spreads the cost of higher education between all its beneficiaries.\""}

Scott Jeff, 24, will serve a minimum term as part of a life sentence for the murder of Isabella Jonas-Wheildon, who was found with \"traumatic injuries\" in Ipswich on 30 June 2023. Her mother, Chelsea Gleason-Mitchell, 24, received 10 years in prison after admitting causing or allowing the death of a child. Ipswich Crown Court heard how the couple, from Bedfordshire, had wheeled Isabella's dead body around in a pushchair for days after her death on 26 June before fleeing from Ipswich.\n\nScott Jeff and Chelsea Gleason-Mitchell were sentenced at Ipswich Crown Court following a seven-week trial\n\nThe pair were also sentenced to three months each for cruelty to a child in relation to cannabis and six months each for cruelty to a child in relation to cocaine, to run concurrently. Gleason-Mitchell was found not guilty of murder at a trial in November. High Court judge Mr Justice Neil Garnham said: \"There she was, a two-year-old child, totally dependent on the two of you. \"Jeff, you subjected that defenceless little girl to a brutal campaign of violence and those attacks were monstrous. She feared what was going to happen next. \"Gleason-Mitchell, you are a weak and spineless person and pathetically desperate.

The couple wheeled Isabella's dead body around in a pushchair for days after her death\n\nWhen speaking in court, Thomas Wheildon, Isabella's father, said: \"Isabella was the most wonderful addition to my life - she was an extension of me and I miss her every day. \"When she died a part of me died and my entire world came crashing down – it has completely changed me and I am a shell of the man I once was. \"Isabella was perfect in every way and had a life so full of promise, but now all my dreams for her will never be realised – I'll never take her for her first day of school. \"Her life was tragically cut short by you wicked, sadistic and vile people. I am so sorry Isabella. I am sorry for not being able to protect you.\"\n\nDuring a seven-week trial the court heard how the toddler suffered \"psychological torment\" and \"physical trauma\" at the hands of Jeff and his \"evil temper\". Frustrated over Isabella's struggles with potty training, he would repeatedly kick and stamp on her and punish her with cold showers, all while her mother \"stood by and did nothing\". The brutal beatings resulted in Isabella suffering injuries usually seen in \"high-velocity traffic accidents\" or when someone has been \"kicked by a horse\". Bone pathologist Prof Anthony Freemont told the court, during the couple's trial, that he had never before seen such a severe pelvic injury in a child in his 40-year career.\n\nIsabella's dead body was found in a locked bathroom in a temporary housing unit in Ipswich\n\nSmiley, blonde-haired Isabella, who was described as \"engaging and happy\", died from a bone marrow embolism as a consequence of skeletal trauma. \"The level of injuries were just truly, truly horrific,\" said Det Ch Insp Craig Powell, from Suffolk and Norfolk police forces' joint investigation team. \"The overall level of abuse and the way in which poor Isabella suffered is truly shocking and the actions of the pair were abhorrent. \"It's not lost on any of us as police officers and parents how shocking it is and the escalation and the speed with which this developed and led to such a tragic end.\"\n\nThe abuse started shortly after the pair, while under the influence of drugs, left their hometown of Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, and fled to the Norfolk coast. After staying at the St George Hotel in Great Yarmouth, they slept inside a tent on a beach in Caister-on-Sea before spending three nights at a caravan park. By 19 June, Jeff and Gleason-Mitchell had moved into the East Villas housing complex in Sidegate Lane, Ipswich, having lied about fleeing domestic violence. Seven days later, Isabella was dead. But, instead of reporting it to the police, the couple decided to act as if she was alive and continued \"living a normal life\". Today the court heard how her body was \"treated with disdain\" after the death and had a \"bag of shopping casually placed\" on top of it in the pushchair. In \"macabre\" CCTV footage seen by the BBC, they could be seen wheeling her lifeless body around Ipswich in a pushchair, all while shopping, drinking and taking cocaine.\n\nThe alarm was only raised when, on 29 June, Gleason-Mitchell told her friend Joanne Gardner that Isabella had been dead in her pushchair for about three days. The following day they abandoned Isabella and left their flat, catching a bus into the town centre before going shopping, to McDonald's and then a pub. The pair then headed to the Corn Exchange pub, in Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, before spending several hours drinking and laughing before being arrested on 1 July. Mitigating, Sasha Wass KC, representing the former nursery assistant Gleason-Mitchell, said she \"of course failed to protect her daughter\" but had a \"deep love for her\" and her \"grief was immense\". Jeff's barrister, Christopher Paxton KC, said while his \"immaturity\" was a \"significant mitigating\" factor, \"no mitigation can justify\" what he did to Isabella.

{"context": "Historic writer's desk could be 'knackered' old fake\n\nMuseum visitors will be asked whether they believe the piece of furniture really was Dr Johnson's desk\n\nThe desk of the writer Dr Samuel Johnson is to be returned to his former London home for the first time in more than 260 years. Except, in a strange twist, its owner is now uncertain whether it really is the desk of the famous 18th Century dictionary author. It's been suggested that despite many years of being treated as a literary relic, it could have been part of a Victorian hustle to make money. It will be the star attraction of a new museum exhibition, but visitors will be asked whether they now believe it's authentic.\n\nThe plaque records the desk being given to the Oxford college in 1867\n\nDr Samuel Johnson was an 18th Century literary giant, remembered for compiling in 1755 what was then the most comprehensive dictionary of the English language. In the TV comedy Blackadder the Third, Dr Johnson was portrayed by Robbie Coltrane, with the painstakingly researched dictionary ending up on the fire. What's now in dispute is the fate of the desk on which he wrote the dictionary when he was living in Gough Square, in a house which is now a museum to his memory. Since the 19th Century the wooden desk has been in Pembroke College Oxford - and the college is lending this prized possession to the Dr Johnson House museum. But when Lynda Mugglestone, professor of the history of English at the college, began to check out the provenance of the desk, there were some unexpected questions. \"The real story is that we don't quite know if it's the real desk,\" she says.\n\nThe desk will be on show at the Dr Johnson House in London\n\nIt had come to the college through a clergyman who had been close to Dr Johnson's god daughter, Elizabeth Ann Lowe, and her sister. A plaque was attached to signify its historic importance. But the puzzle is whether those sisters ever really had the desk or whether they used their literary connection as a way of guilt-tripping some famous writers of their era for money. Prof Mugglestone says that as the centenary of Johnson's dictionary was being marked in 1855, the Lowe sisters began writing asking for cash, describing themselves as in penury and with nothing left but a desk which they said had been left to them by the great writer. They were \"living in poverty\" in Deptford in south London, says Prof Mugglestone, and they made clear that \"donations were welcome\". Writers such as Thomas Carlyle and Charles Dickens, who had just written Hard Times, began to fund raise for the sisters. Literary London was mobilised to help the sisters who were the surviving connections to Dr Johnson. The desk became part of that story.\n\nDr Johnson's House, where he wrote his dictionary, is now a museum\n\nDickens wrote of the sisters being in \"great poverty, but undemonstrative and uncomplaining, though very old - with nothing to speak of in the wide world, but the plain fir desk on which Johnson wrote his English Dictionary\". Such pleas from Dickens helped to raise large donations for the sisters, with the desk being saved as a \"proud possession to the English nation\". But Celine Luppo McDaid, director of the Dr Johnson House, says it is now seems unclear whether this desk was actually Johnson's. The case for it being authentic, she says, is that the sisters could have been thinking: \"We've sold everything else, but we still have this treasured desk, it's the last thing we have.\" Or else it might have been a chance to turn a bit of spare furniture into a financial lifeline. \"They might have seen an opportunity and decided that the knackered old desk in the corner was 'Johnson's desk',\" says the museum director Ms McDaid.\n\nProf Lynda Mugglestone has researched the history of the desk\n\nProf Mugglestone says women in this era could be extremely financially vulnerable, with few ways to support themselves and such attempts to get money from rich connections might have been their only chance. The Lowe sisters did have a link with Johnson through their father, an impecunious painter Mauritius Lowe, who had lost a grant from the Royal Academy after some rather murky \"misconduct\". Ms McDaid says the painter and his children were living in \"abject poverty\" and Johnson, often broke himself, was sympathetic and helped them with money. But the so far unanswerable question is whether the Lowe family really ended up with the famous desk and had kept it for more than 70 years after Johnson's death. It's from the right era, but is it the actual desk? Researching the desk's origins revealed records of other petitions for money by Elizabeth Ann Lowe and her sister, essentially begging letters - with stories that were not always consistent. The prime minister and the royals were among those getting requests for support. \"She is lying to someone,\" says Prof Mugglestone. But that doesn't ultimately prove either way the authenticity of the desk.\n\nThe desk will be in Dr Johnson's former home in Gough Square\n\nThe exhibition will have to embrace this ambiguity and accept that even though this has been seen as Johnson's desk for generations, it might not be. Visitors to the exhibition next month will be asked to give their views on whether it was the desk where Dr Johnson's dictionary was written. \"I'd love it to be authentic,\" says Ms McDaid. \"Nothing is more evocative than a writer's desk... But there's no way we'll know.\" The exhibition, Desks, Drudgery and the Dictionary: Samuel Jo", "continuation": "hnson’s Garret Lexicography, opens on 3 July at Dr Johnson's House, 17 Gough Square, London EC4A 3DE"}
{"context": "Four retired detectives who ran the first Stephen Lawrence murder investigation should not face criminal charges for their actions in the case, a review has concluded. The review, by a senior lawyer for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), upholds a previous decision not to prosecute, which was challenged by Stephen's parents and friend. Stephen was murdered in April 1993 in a racist attack in south London. His mother, Baroness Lawrence, said she was \"bewildered, disappointed, and angry\" at the decision, adding: \"I am sure the public will be too.\"\n\n\"The decision today means – as things stand – that not a single ", "continuation": "officer will ever be held responsible in any way shape or form for the obvious and unforgivable failings in Stephen’s case,\" she said in a statement. She said the CPS's decision \"marks a new low in the way the criminal justice [system] has treated me and my family\", saying it was \"unjustifiable\". The CPS said it understood the decision not to prosecute would be \"extremely disappointing\" for Stephen’s family and friends and it had offered to meet close family members to explain its reasoning in detail. The initial investigation failed to bring anyone to justice - although two men were jailed in 2012 for Stephen's murder. The officers had been investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), but last year the CPS chose not to pursue a criminal prosecution after considering a file of evidence. A victim’s right to review the charging decision was triggered by Stephen’s parents, Neville Lawrence and Baroness Doreen Lawrence, and his friend Duwayne Brooks, who was present during the attack. The latest review found there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and therefore none of the four will be charged. The decision means no officers have been held criminally responsible for what is widely seen as one of Scotland Yard’s biggest disasters. The four retired officers investigated by the IOPC were:\n• None Former detective superintendent Ian Crampton, who was senior investigating officer (SIO) for the first four days of the murder investigation\n• None Former detective superintendent Brian Weeden, who took over as SIO from Mr Crampton and was in charge for 14 months\n• None Former detective inspector Benjamin Bullock, who acted as deputy SIO under Mr Crampton and Mr Weeden\n• None Former detective chief superintendent William Ilsley, who oversaw the team responsible for the first murder investigation Rosemary Ainslie, head of the CPS's special crime division, said there had been an \"extensive review\" of their decision in July last year not to bring criminal charges against the four officers after the family's challenge. She said the review \"involved an independent prosecutor re-examining a substantial amount of evidence and material in the case\". “Offences of misconduct in public office were reconsidered, but the review upheld the original decision not to bring any criminal charges against the four officers in the case,\" she said.\n\n(From left to right) Ian Crampton, Brian Weeden, Benjamin Bullock and William Ilsley\n\nBut Baroness Lawrence said the review considered only \"the first few weeks of failures\" by the four officers \"when we know that the failures of the first investigation continued well into 1994\". She said the review only looked at failures relating to the five prime suspects, \"but we now know that there were significant failures in 1993 relating to other suspects and to Matthew White\". Last year the BBC publicly identified a sixth suspect in Stephen's murder, Matthew White, who died in 2021, and exposed a series of failures relating to him, including that he was not made a suspect by the first investigation despite multiple reasons to treat him as one. The first investigation team also severely mishandled an approach by White’s stepfather, who wanted to tell police his stepson had admitted being present during Stephen's murder. The BBC revealed Brian Weeden was aware of an approach by the stepfather, but it was not properly followed up. This major failure was not part of the case against any of the four officers who were not charged. That case considered only the first few weeks of the 1993 investigation. Baroness Lawrence said: \"How can such an obvious failure not be part of the case that the CPS released today? \"The only conclusion I draw is that the IOPC and NCA (National Crime Agency) carried out a shallow inquiry looking only at matters in the public domain and gave too much credence to the retired officers.\" She continued: \"The reviewed decision, issued today, makes not a single mention of racism. \"Everyone now accepts that institutional racism was at the heart of the first investigation and yet, no consideration has been given to how it impacted the decision-making process. It clearly did. \"How can racism not be part of and at the forefront of the CPS’s decision on Stephen’s case? This is unforgivable.\" Neville Lawrence said: \"I'm really disappointed about that, because I felt there was enough evidence there from early [on] to suggest that these people weren't doing their jobs in the right way. \"So for the CPS to decide not to bring them before the court to answer questions, I'm disappointed.\" Stephen Lawrence's friend Duwayne Brookes, who was also attacked but managed to escape and avoid physical injury, said the CPS failed to treat him as a victim and take into account racism in the police. In 1999, a public inquiry led by Sir William Macpherson concluded the first Lawrence murder investigation was \"marred by a combination of professional incompetence, institutional racism and a failure of leadership by senior officers\". The Macpherson report was highly critical of the decision not to make quick arrests. Arrests did not take place for two weeks, despite police receiving information implicating four of the prime suspects within 24 hours of the stabbing. A 1997 investigation by the police watchdog was also critical, but by then only Mr Bullock was still serving in the Met and therefore available for a disciplinary process. The IOPC investigation which led to the CPS referral started in 2014 and examined allegations of corruption against a separate officer - John Davidson - who worked on the first Lawrence murder investigation. This investigation, carried out on its behalf by the National Crime Agency, followed an official review by barrister Mark Ellison KC that said there were outstanding lines of inquiry into allegations of corruption involving Mr Davidson. Mr Davidson was told in 2019 that he was no longer under investigation, with the IOPC ultimately focusing on the four senior officers from the first murder inquiry, and their handling of the early part of the case. In 2020, the IOPC passed a file of evidence to the CPS, which was asked to consider whether they may have committed the criminal offence of misconduct in public office. The criminal offence of misconduct in public office is committed when the office holder acts - or fails to act - in a way that constitutes a breach of the duties of that office."}
{"context": "Bank accounts locked and cash withdrawn after elderly gave power to law firm partner\n\nElderly and vulnerable people in south-east England have told the BBC how they lost control of their money and property after dealing with a law firm based in Essex. They described how they were persuaded - and sometimes felt under pressure - to grant lasting power of attorney (LPA) to a man called Ron Hiller, a partner in the firm. LPA is a legal agreement in which someone appoints an \"attorney\" to make decisions on their behalf, either for finance or health and welfare. Attorneys are supposed to act in their clients' best interests. But we investigated 30 cases involving Mr Hiller and his firm, Craybeck Law, and found a disturbing pattern of events:\n• None People found they had no access to their bank accounts and no idea how much Mr Hiller was charging for being their attorney\n• None Large amounts of cash were withdrawn without a reasonable explanation\n• None Properties were sold for what owners and others considered was lower than market value, and possessions were cleared and disposed of without owners' knowledge or informed consent\n\nThere has been a massive rise in LPAs in England and Wales in recent years. In 2023, more than one million people registered - a rise of 37% on the year before. I spoke to dozens of vulnerable people, as well as their friends, family and neighbours, who expressed concern about Ron Hiller's business practices. My findings also raise concerns about the potential lack of oversight within the system, and whether the body that regulates attorneys - the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) - is able to deal with such problems. A spokesperson for Craybeck Law has denied any wrongdoing but said the firm could not respond to claims about specific individuals, because of client confidentiality. We made repeated attempts to speak to Mr Hiller in person, including at his home, but he did not respond.\n\nCarole was in her 60s, living alone in a house in Uxbridge, west London. In April 2022 she was admitted to hospital with an infection. She never came back. Her friends and neighbours, Bert and Hazel, wanted to visit her in hospital but Covid restrictions were in place. Then the hospital told them she had been transferred to a care home. They rang the home repeatedly but were never put through. They left messages but their calls were not returned. Within months, Carole's house had been completely cleared out and sold for £355,000 - a low price, the neighbours thought, considering other houses in the street were fetching up to half a million. Hazel and Bert were worried about what was happening, but they had no legal right to know any more details. They wrote asking for my help, as they knew I had investigated a similar case. Together we paid a visit to Carole's care home in the Hertfordshire town of Rickmansworth. Carole told us she was desperate to leave, but was stuck there. She said she had been introduced to Ron Hiller at the care home, and he had convinced her to grant him lasting power of attorney over her finances.\n\nCarole found herself stranded in a care home without ready access to her finances\n\nMost people appoint family members to be their attorney but for Carole, this had not been an option. Her closest relative was Sandie - however, she lived about a 100-mile drive away and suffered from serious health problems. A property and finance LPA can be activated as soon as it is registered. Carole told us she had been in a lot of pain when she arrived at the care home, and her LPA shows she agreed to grant these powers to Mr Hiller straight away. Since that point, she had been without her bank cards and had received no statements. She was also in the dark about how much she was paying Mr Hiller to manage her finances. She had wanted to call Hazel and Bert, but Mr Hiller had given her a new phone that didn't contain any of her old contacts. Carole told us he had advised her to sell her house in order to pay the care home fees, then later told her it had fetched a low price because nobody had wanted to buy in her area. As we sat talking, Sandie looked at her phone and discovered the house was on the market again. This time, the asking price was almost £100,000 more than when Mr Hiller had sold it for Carole.\n\nThe hidden scandal of Power of Attorney - how one man controls the finances of scores of vulnerable people. Read less\n\nAfter meeting Carole in the care home, Sandie asked for detailed accounts from Craybeck Law. What came was a slow drip-feed of bank statements, with no real explanation of Mr Hiller's charges and hardly any receipts. However, they did show that large sums of money had been taken from Carole's account. Her bank card had been used to make a series of £300 cash withdrawals from ATMs in the Essex town of South Benfleet, near Mr Hiller's office. He told Sandie that Carole had authorised the withdrawals - but later, when Carole asked to see invoices, they were not produced.\n\nThe statements also showed a charge for arranging for Carole's house to be cleared. I later discovered the work was given to Silverback Commerical Removals, and that the director of this firm was David James Hiller - the son of Ron Hiller. Craybeck Law denied there was any conflict of interest and said the decision to use Silverback was reached after quotes were sought from alternative providers. Carole has no record of these. I heard a similar story about house sales a few miles away in Watford. Ron Hiller was appointed to oversee the finances of an elderly woman called Elizabeth - her house had been sold for £350,000 after she went to live in a care home. It was then left empty and sold on a few months later for £525,000 - without any signs that improvements had taken place. Craybeck Law said it would not comment on individual cases but told us that the properties it handled were often in poor condition and that sometimes they needed to be sold quickly to cover care home fees, and \"to avoid the risk of a sale falling through\".\n\nMany of the people I spoke to, felt Ron Hiller had put them under pressure to appoint him as attorney. Some also told me they had been introduced to him by care professionals, who had led them to believe he was a qualified solicitor. On the website for Craybeck Law, Ron Hiller is described as a partner in the firm's elder client division. However, the letters after his name - MCICM - denote a diploma in credit management and debt collection. There is no mention of Ron Hiller on the official register of qualified solicitors either. A spokesperson for Craybeck Law denied Mr Hiller had ever given the impression he was a qualified solicitor. They added that changes to the law in 2008 meant that individuals who were not qualified solicitors were permitted to become partners in law firms.\n\nIn the Hertfordshire town of Letchworth, a woman called Petra told me how an NHS social worker called Margaret Falegan had brought Mr Hiller to her house during a professional visit. Petra suffers from anxiety and had previously told Ms Falegan - whom she described as her mental health nurse - that she was having trouble with her bills. She felt she was being put \"very much\" under pressure to grant Mr Hiller power of attorney, even though she felt uneasy about him. The next day, she went to her local Citizens Advice Bureau and - with the help of the staff there - suspended the process. A few weeks later, she received a letter from Mr Hiller. It read: \"I've informed the mental health team, Stevenage, of your decision, as this may impact on the level of support they may have planned to provide you in the future.\" Whatever Mr Hiller had meant by this, Petra read it as a threat. She told me she was still upset about the letter months later, and it had destroyed her trust in the mental health team.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Petra: \"I just wanted to get him out.\"\n\nI have heard of other cases where Margaret Falegan introduced Mr Hiller to potential clients in the course of her professional duties. In one, the appointment was made in spite of objections from the man's relatives that he had dementia and did not understand what he was signing. When I approached Ms Falegan for a response, she denied putting pressure on her clients to sign with Mr Hiller. However, she did not say whether her employer, Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (HPUFT), knew that he had accompanied her on client visits. In response to my findings, HPUFT said it had now launched an investigation into Ms Falegan, as well as other social workers who had introduced Ron Hiller to clients. The trust said it had also raised the matter with the appropriate professional bodies and the police. \"If an NHS or care worker is making introductions between their clients and potential attorneys that is very concerning,\" says consultant psychiatrist James Warner. \"If [elderly or vulnerable people] don't have the ability to decide who they want to appoint as their attorneys, they shouldn't be appointing attorneys.\" Craybeck Law said that when a potential client was introduced to the firm, a qualified individual - usually a social worker - would have a discussion with that person, to ensure they had the mental capacity to make the decision to appoint the firm as their attorney. They said this would take place without a Craybeck Law representative present. It also said the firm had processes to ensure that no individual felt coerced into signing powers of attorney.\n\nIn several of the cases I looked at, Craybeck Law - and chiefly Ron Hiller - not only acted as attorney but also executor of clients' wills. An executor is legally responsible for carrying out the instructions in a person's will and handling their estate. However, in at least two cases, Mr Hiller seems to have ignored the instructions he was given. One client was surprised when I told her that the will he had drawn up for her split her estate between four charities - including one she had never heard of. Another client told me he had not seen a copy of a will Mr Hiller had drawn up for him, and did not understand its contents. Valerie in Borehamwood also appointed Mr Hiller as attorney and executor of her will. After she died in 2022, it emerged that her family had been left out of her will and her entire estate - estimated at about £220,000 - was left to a police charity. Her brother and sister-in-law, John and Kaye, live in Australia and were not well-placed to challenge the will. The fact that family members were no longer beneficiaries also meant they were not entitled to any financial information. \"We couldn't see how much [Ron Hiller] was charging for probate or how much he charged every year for being her power of attorney,\" Kaye told me. Ann Stanyer, a leading lawyer in this field, told me that if an attorney is also the executor of a will, there is much less scope for proper scrutiny: \"They can both operate the powers of attorney during their lifetime and take fees through that, but they can then take big fees from the estate as well.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Sue Mitchell tries to speak to Ron Hiller at his home\n\nCraybeck Law said that the firm was governed by the Solicitors Regulation Authority's (SRA) rules and principles, including strict conduct and ethical guidelines that it upheld. It said that much of what had been put to it was inaccurate and based on second- or third-hand hearsay and that it fully refuted the insinuations made about the way it supported its clients. The SRA has now confirmed it is looking into allegations made in this article.\n\nCarole has now moved out of the care home in Rickmansworth, and into a small flat in Folkestone near her cousin Sandy. She has the added work and expense of buying all the basics for her new home, because Ron Hiller disposed of all her furniture and most of her possessions. However, she is happy to be making a fresh start.\n\nCarole has now cut ties with Ron Hiller and moved to a new flat in Folkestone\n\nHer story, and the others in this article, were only a few of those I heard about Ron Hiller. He has acted as attorney for scores of people - a fact ", "continuation": "that Ann Stanyer finds odd. \"You've got to run [LPA] properly and you can't possibly do that if you've got volumes of these things,\" she says. \"I have four or five which are active and that's more than enough.\" The Office of the Public Guardian doesn't appear to track when an attorney has an unusually large number of clients. A former senior judge at the Court of Protection, external, Denzil Lush, is concerned that the OPG is not designed to spot potential problems with the system. For instance, if an attorney's powers are revoked by more than one of their clients, the OPG does not automatically look at why this is happening. The issue has caught the attention of Parliament - a private members bill, which has gone to its second reading, proposes greater safeguards. Many MPs feel it is an urgent problem because of the sheer numbers involved. More than eight million people in England and Wales have now registered an attorney to act for them. The system was designed to protect elderly and vulnerable people, but the danger is that without better safeguards, it could be leaving them open to harm.\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?"}

Oliver Steeper died six days after he choked on pasta bolognese at Jelly Beans Day Nursery, in Ashford, on 23 September 2021. Area Coroner Katrina Hepburn has submitted a Prevention of Future Deaths report (PFD) outlining her concerns about paediatric first aid training and staff education over weaning. An expert in resuscitation at the inquest said the first aid delivered at the nursery was \"poor\" and that guidelines were not properly followed.\n\nIn her report, Ms Hepburn said evidence at the inquest highlighted an \"apparent lack of knowledge\" over staff learning a child's weaning information from their parents and sharing it with other colleagues. She said staff need to lear", "continuation": "n the importance of finding out and recording each child's stage of weaning and understanding the risk of choking.\n\nZoe and Lewis Steeper welcome the report following their son Oliver's death\n\nMs Hepburn also raised concerns over the fact that current early years statutory framework means only one member of staff must have a valid paediatric first aid certificate. \"If that one staff member is unavailable or indisposed when an emergency situation arises, or simply is unable to render the required first aid by nature of the traumatic events unfolding, this may in turn have a serious and detrimental effect on the child requiring assistance,\" she said.\n\nThe coroner has called for more regular refresher training in paediatric first aid, stating the current three-year term is too long of a time frame for staff to remember the correct procedures in detail. Oliver died from a brain injury caused by a cardiac arrest due to choking. A jury at his inquest last month found he died as a result of misadventure. His parents, Zoe and Lewis Steeper, have welcomed the PFD report and hope change will come from it. In a statement they said: \"Since losing Oliver after the choking incident, our mission has been to use his memory to make childcare settings safer places for children at such an important and vulnerable stage in their life, specifically around the preparation of food.\" They said they are looking forward to a response from the government. The Department for Education has confirmed it's received the coroner's report and will respond in due course."}

While people have spoken about conditions in Evin after they have been released, it is rare to get details of inmates' lives while they are still inside.\n\nNasim worked as a hairdresser before she was arrested in April 2023\n\nWhat we have heard reveals not only brutality, but a place of complex contrasts where the prisoners continue to campaign for women's rights and defiantly challenge restrictions imposed on them. There are surprising moments too - one inmate, occasionally allowed time alone with her husband, has even got pregnant. Nasim - who loves rap music and make-up - was taken into custody in April 2023 after joining protests with her friends, one of whom was killed in the government crackdown. She survived interrogations \"by thinking about those who died on the street\". People who saw Nasim when she came out of solitary confinement have described cuts and bruises on her body and how she was tortured to make false confessions. Rezvaneh was also arrested following the protests, along with her husband, in 2023. They both ended up in Evin, which has separate sections for men and women. Her interrogators said they would kill her husband and \"hit him so much that he would turn black like coal, and purple like an aubergine\". After solitary confinement, interrogations and humiliation, Nasim was moved to the women's wing, that houses about 70 people, including Rezvaneh, most of whom were arrested on political charges.\n\nCCTV footage of a cell for trans inmates in Evin prison was leaked in 2020 - it is similar to the cells in the main women's wing\n\nIt is where the British-Iranian citizen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcilffe, who was allowed to return to the UK in 2022, spent nearly four years of her sentence. Most of the women there have been sentenced because of their activism, for offences including spreading propaganda, drawing arms against the regime, and endangering national security. They live in four crowded cells with up to 20 people in each one and bunk beds stacked three-high. Living together in cramped quarters often causes friction, and sometimes fights - both physical and verbal - break out. But the women also forge tight bonds. In winter, \"everyone is freezing\" and the women \"walk around with hot water bottles\" to stay warm. In summer, they swelter in the heat. There is a small kitchen area with a couple of hobs where - if they have enough money to buy food from the prison shop - they can cook for themselves to supplement the basic prison meals that are brought to their cells. A dark, dirty area at the end of a corridor serves as a place to smoke. A small cemented yard with a little area for plants and a volleyball net provides a bit of outside space.\n\nThey can wear their own clothes and are free to move around their living quarters which have two bathrooms. Every evening, they queue to use the toilet and brush their teeth. It was here, after she had been in prison for about four months, that Rezvaneh found out she was pregnant. She had struggled with infertility for years and had given up on ever having a baby. But according to Evin's rules, she and her husband - who is still a prisoner in the men's wing - were occasionally allowed to meet in private and, on one of these occasions, she conceived. When she realised she was pregnant she \"cried for several days\". She found \"the worst thing was the mental pressure and tensions inside the prison\". Finding a quiet place in the crowded cells, where people spend most of their days sitting on their beds, was a constant challenge. The prison food left her craving apple juice, bread, and meat, which were hard to get hold of. When she could get some meat from the prison shop it was at least twice the price of meat on the outside. The prison eventually allowed her to have an ultrasound scan at four months, and doctors told her she was having a girl. As she listened to \"each heartbeat the sense of hope became stronger\". But she was afraid that the conditions in prison would endanger the baby's health. Rezvaneh was not just concerned about her diet - she has epilepsy and needed to avoid stress. Prison doctors told her she had a high risk of miscarriage.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. An account of Rezvaneh's pregnancy and the birth of her child, voiced by an actor and narrated by Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\n\nVida, a journalist, loves to paint. She uses bedsheets for canvases and paints portraits of the other women. One, which was smuggled out of Evin, is of Kurdish prisoner Pakhshan Azizi who travelled to Kurdish areas of Iraq and Syria to help victims of the Islamic ", "continuation": "State group. Pakhshan has been sentenced to death, following charges of using arms to fight the Iranian regime, and there is great concern this sentence could be carried out soon. Vida has been warned not to draw anything with a hidden meaning. On one of the walls in the yard she painted crumbling bricks with a green forest behind them. The authorities sprayed over it. In a corridor she painted a picture of an Iranian cheetah running. Some of the women \"kept saying how much good energy they got from it\". But one night the authorities \"went and painted over it\" and restricted Vida's access to painting supplies. One of her murals has been left intact though - huge, blue ocean waves on the walls of the corridor where the women go to smoke.\n\nVida's portrait of Pakhshan Azizi, who has been sentenced to death\n\nGetting medical care has been a constant battle for the women. One of the inmates, human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi, has life-threatening heart and lung conditions. But in prison she has had to fight long and hard for access to a doctor. Relatives said that officials repeatedly blocked treatment because she refused to wear a headscarf to a medical appointment. The authorities only relented after fellow prisoners went on hunger strike for two weeks. Narges was released for 21 days at the start of December on medical grounds. Behind bars, she and the others have carried out protests, pushing the boundaries and continuing to fight for their rights. Although the law requires them to wear headscarves, many refuse. And after a long fight with the authorities, the women were allowed curtains around the beds so they could have some privacy, out of view of CCTV cameras. One of the toughest things for the women is waiting to hear their sentences. Nasim's interrogators had threatened her with the death penalty and she had to wait nearly 500 days to find out her fate. She found solace in her fellow prisoners - who she has described as sisters who give her life and act as \"a balm on the wounds\" of her wings. Every morning, one of her friends pulls aside the bed curtain and makes her get up for breakfast. \"Each day we think of something to do, so by the end of the day we can tell ourselves, 'We lived today,'\" one of our sources explains.\n\nThirty-five-year-old Vida was charged with distributing anti-government propaganda and working against national security\n\nOthers spend their time reading poetry, singing, playing homemade card games and watching TV - there are two televisions where they can watch Iranian channels showing drama, documentaries and football. It is these small things that kept Nasim going while she waited for her sentence, under the constant threat of execution. When the sentence finally came, she was given six years in prison, 74 lashes and 20 years in exile in a small town far from Tehran. She had been charged with distributing propaganda and drawing arms against the Islamic Republic. Despite the severity of the sentence, Nasim felt she could breathe again, and embrace the life she thought she had lost. Three other women in the wing have been sentenced to death for drawing arms against the regime or affiliation to armed groups. However one of them has had her sentence overturned. More than 800 people were executed in Iran last year - the highest number in eight years, according to Amnesty International. Most were for crimes involving violence and drugs. A handful were women. So every Tuesday, the women protest against executions, chanting in the prison yard, refusing to move all night and staging hunger strikes. The campaign has spread through jails across Iran, gaining international support. On the anniversary of Mahsa Amini's death the women in Evin burned headscarves. There have been repercussions - sometimes the guards raid their cells and women have been beaten and injured. They can also be taken for further interrogations, put back in solitary confinement or have phone calls and visits blocked. Most of the guards are women and \"sometimes they are kind, sometimes they are cruel and hard-hearted, depending on what orders they receive from a higher authority\", says one of our sources. The Iranian government routinely denies allegations of human rights violations, saying conditions inside Evin prison meet all necessary standards and prisoners are not mistreated.\n\nAs Rezvaneh's due date approached, the prison authorities allowed her to temporarily leave prison for the birth. In October, she had a baby girl. But her joy and relief at the safe arrival of her daughter is mingled with fear, sadness and anger. Her husband was not allowed out of prison with her, although she has been able to take their daughter to visit him in Evin. And because of the stress, Rezvaneh has struggled to produce breastmilk. She is expecting to be recalled to Evin prison soon with her baby daughter to serve the rest of her five-year sentence - if she's not granted an early release, that could be nearly four years. Babies are usually allowed to stay with their mothers in jail until the age of two. After that they are often sent to a close relative, or if that is not possible, they might be placed in a children's home. But rather than stop the inmates, one prisoner has said the challenges they face have made her \"braver and stronger,\" supporting their belief that \"the future is clear: to fight, even in prison\".\n\nOne of Vida's paintings shows the hills north of Tehran which can be seen from Evin\n\nBBC 100 Women names 100 inspiring and influential women around the world every year.

{"context": "A construction worker drinks water during the heatwave in Delhi\n\nIn one of the largest hospitals in India’s capital, Delhi, a physician says he has never seen anything like this before. “This is an unprecedented heatwave. In my 13 years of working here, I don’t remember signing a death certificate for heat stroke. This year, I’ve signed several,” says Ajay Chauhan of the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital (RMLH). Delhi has been reeling under a prolonged heatwave, with daily temperatures crossing 40C (104F) since May, peaking at nearly 50C. Humidity and hot winds exacerbate the heat, compounded by water shortages and power outages due to soaring demand. And people are dying from the heat, with media reports suggesting at least 20 fatalities due to heat-related illnesses. A heat stroke, the most severe heat illness, is identified by three key signs: exposure to high heat and humidity, a core body temperature of 40.5C (105F) or higher, and mental changes like mild confusion or impaired consciousness. Heat stroke is also a silent killer, and victims can begin to fall ill hours after exposure to sun. India's National Centre for Disease Control calls heat strokes a \"life-threatening\" condition with a mortality rate of 40-64%. Since Dr Chauhan's hospital in Delhi opened a heat stroke clinic in late May, seven people have died of heat stroke and more than 40 have been treated for heat-related ailments.\n\nAjay Chauhan, head of the Delhi heat stroke clinic, says he has never seen so many patients\n\nThe majority were men working outdoors and in small, unregulated factories with poor conditions, enduring extreme heat exposure. To be sure, the heatwave is not restricted to Delhi: dozens have died from heat-related illnesses since March, with more than 50 deaths in just three days in early June in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Odisha. At the RMLH clinic, possibly the first of its kind in India, the effort to save heat stroke patients underscores the challenge posed by rapid climate and health emergencies. A few days ago, a man was wheeled in with body temperatures soaring to 42C (107.7F). A body’s normal core temperature is 37-38C. He was suffering from a heat stroke. At this temperature, a human body begins to shut down, cells deteriorate, and there’s a risk of organ failure. Sweating ceases as blood flow to the skin stops, leaving it cold and clammy. At the clinic, doctors dunked the patient into the icy waters of a 250-litre ceramic tub where the temperature ranges from 0 to 5C. (The clinic is equipped with two ceramic tubs, a 200kg ice-making machine, rectal thermometers, ice boxes and inflatable tubs.) The patient took about 25 minutes to cool down and begin recovering before he was moved to the ward for further treatment.\n\nA patient suffering from heat exhaustion being wheeled into a hospital in Ahmedabad\n\n“Early cooling saves lives. Every second counts,” says Dr Chauhan. A delay can either prove to be fatal or leave the patient bleeding, or with damaged kidneys and liver. It is not difficult to fall ill in Delhi. Life is tough. A third of residents live in substandard and congested housing. The city’s 6,400-odd slums, home to more than a million households, lack adequate cooling and face seasonal livelihood crises. Men fall ill working outdoors; women fall sick after spending extended periods in kitchen settings with traditional stoves. Green spaces are scarce. In the peak of summer, the city turns into a scorching furnace, trapped between the blazing heat from above and the searing ground below. Anjana Kumari, the wife of a daily wage worker admitted at RHML with heat stroke, told The Indian Express , externalthat their slum hutment's only fan wasn’t working du", "continuation": "e to a power cut. Her husband, exhausted from working all day on Monday, couldn't sleep and later suffered seizures, vomiting, and diarrhoea. She rushed him to the hospital at night. “Doctors have told me he won't be able to walk for some time and need a lot of care,” Ms Kumari said. Those who work outdoors suffer the most. A large majority of respondents in a new Greenpeace survey, external on how heat impacts street vendors in Delhi reported health issues due to hot weather. Irritability was the most common (73.44%), followed by headaches, dehydration, sunburn, fatigue and muscle cramps. Most faced challenges accessing medical care due to lack of money.\n\nAt the Delhi heat stroke clinic, patients are dunked into ceramic tubs of icy water\n\n“The heat increases every day. We are living under the open sky. What resources can I gather? If possible, there should be some trees and plants nearby, so that fresh air keeps blowing and the body gets some relief,” Guddi, a sugarcane juice vendor who operates a manual crusher, told Greenpeace. “After being exposed to the heat of the sun all day, I don’t feel like eating dinner at night. All I can think about is stretching my legs and going to sleep,” she said. And all over India, people are falling sick due to the heat. A new nationwide survey by Centre for Rapid Insights (CRI) offers some startling insights, external into how heatwaves hurt people and cripple productivity. It showed that 45% of the households contacted reported at least one member getting sick from the heat last month. Among those affected, over 67% had household members sick for more than five days. This impact was particularly severe among the poorest. Specifically 32.5% of households with motorcycles and 28.2% with no vehicles had members ill for over five days; the figure was lower at 21.8% for households with cars.\n\nThere are more than 200,000 homeless people in Delhi, many of whom live in congested shelters in the sweltering heat\n\nSome three-fourths of India’s workers work in heat-exposed jobs like construction and mining. This becomes worse during heatwaves as there are fewer safe and productive work hours during the day. A Lancet study reported a loss of 167.2 billion potential labour hours in India due to excessive heat in 2021. “The productivity loss is staggering,” says Neelanjan Sircar, director of CRI. Heatwaves killed more than 25,000 people between 1992 and 2019, according to official figures. As India doesn’t compile mortality data properly, experts reckon the actual toll would be much higher. India’s heat action plans are also not working well, as a study found. Tellingly, 68% of the vendors in Delhi have heard about heatwaves, according to the Greenpeace study. Yet the heat emergency doesn’t figure in the political discourse. “Many see a heatwave as an enduring act of nature, with little expectation from the government to intervene. It reflects a broader issue of low expectations in India,\" Mr Sircar says. Things look dire in Delhi. In 2022, India saw 203 heatwave days, the highest on record, with Delhi experiencing around 17 of them, external. March marked India's hottest month recorded by the the weather department, while Delhi had its second-hottest April in 72 years. \"This is going to get worse. We need to be very careful,\" says Dr Chauhan."}

{"context": "Syria's new transitional PM calls for stability and calm\n\nMohammed al-Bashir chaired a meeting with ministers from both the transitional and former governments\n\nThe prime minister of Syria's new transitional government has said it is time for people to \"enjoy stability and calm\" after the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad. Mohammed al-Bashir, the former head of the rebel administration in the north-west, was speaking to Al Jazeera after being tasked with governing until March 2025 by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahir al-Sham (HTS) and its allies. Bashir chaired a meeting in Damascus on Tuesday attended by members of his new government and those of Assad's former cabinet to discuss the transfer of portfolios and institutions. It came as the UN envoy for Syria said the rebels must transform their \"good messages\" into practice on the ground.\n\nThe US secretary of state meanwhile said Washington would recognise and fully support a future Syrian government so long as it emerged from a credible, inclusive process that respected minorities. In 2011, Assad brutally crushed a peaceful pro-democracy uprising, sparking a devastating civil war in which more than half a million people have been killed and 12 million others forced to flee their homes.\n\nBefore this week, Mohammed al-Bashir was little known outside the areas dominated by HTS in the north-western provinces of Idlib and Aleppo. According to his CV, he trained as an electrical engineer and worked at gas plants before the start of the civil war in 2011. In January, Bashir was appointed prime minister of the Salvation Government (SG), which HTS established to run the territory under its control. The SG functioned like a state, with ministries, local departments, judicial and security authorities, while maintaining a religious council guided by Islamic law. Around four million people, many of them displaced from elsewhere in the country, lived under its rule. When institutions stopped functioning in Aleppo after HTS and its allies captured the city earlier this month at the start of their lightning offensive, the SG stepped in to restore public services. Technicians reportedly helped repair local electricity and telecommunications networks, security forces patrolled streets, medics volunteered at hospitals, and charities distributed bread. \"It is true that Idlib is a small region lacking resources, but they [SG officials] have a very high-level of experience after starting with nothing,\" HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani was heard telling Assad's former prime minister, Mohammed al-Jalali, in a video of a meeting in Damascus on Monday. \"We will benefit from your experiences. We certainly won't ignore you,\" he added.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bashir was pictured chairing a meeting of former SG ministers and ministers who served under Jalali. He was sat in front of the Syrian opposition and the HTS flags. \"[We] invited members from the old government and some directors from the administration in Idlib and its surrounding areas in order to facilitate all the necessary works for the next two months until we have a constitutional system to be able to serve the Syrian people,\" Bashir told Al Jazeera afterwards. \"We had other meetings to restart the institutions to be able to serve our people in Syria,\" he added.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, rebel commander Hasan Abdul Ghani announced his forces have taken control over the eastern Syrian city of Deir al-Zour. It had previously been captured by Syrian Kurdish troops on Friday. Meanwhile, life appeared to be slowly returning to normal in the capital Damascus after two days of near-shutdown. There were many pedestrians and cars out on the streets, and some shops and restaurants were open. People were also sweeping away spent bullet cases that littered the ground around the central Umayyad Square, where many rebel fighters fired into the air as crowds celebrated the end of Assad's 24-year rule. A Muslim cleric there told the BBC that Syrians were looking to the future and wanted a peaceful and united country. \"We want to establish a nation built on principles of nationalism, justice, and the rule of law, a technocratic state where institutions are respected, and equal opportunities are guaranteed for all,\" Sheikh Abdul Rahman al-Kouky said.\n\nThere were many pedestrians and cars out on the streets of Damascus on Tuesday\n\nUN special envoy Geir Pedersen told reporters in Geneva the transition needed to ensure \"the representation of the broadest possible spectrum of the Syrian society and the Syrian parties\". \"If this is not happening, then we risk new conflict,\" he warned. Pedersen said the designation of HTS as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US, UK and other countries would be a \"complicating factor\" in efforts to find a way forward. HTS's precursor, al-Nusra Front, pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda in 2013. But three years later, it formally cut ties with the jihadist group. \"The reality is so far that HTS and also the other armed groups have been sending good messages to the Syrian people... of unity, of inclusiveness,\" Pedersen noted. \"We gave also seen... reassuring things on the ground\" in Aleppo and Hama, another major city that was captured last week, he added. He said the most important test would be how the transitional arrangements in Damascus were organised and implemented. \"If they are really inclusive of all the different groups and all the communities in Syria... then there is a possibility for a new beginning.\" \"And then I do believe that the international community will look at the [terrorist] listing of HTS again,\" he added. Later, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in effect laid out a series of conditions which, if fulfilled, would see Syria enjoy Washington's full recognition. \"It's imperative that all actors involved protect civilians; respect human rights, especially of vulnerable minorities; preserve the state's ", "continuation": "institutions, its services to help meet the needs of the Syrian; and to build towards inclusive governance,\" he said. \"Statements by rebel leaders to these ends are very welcome, but of course, the real measure of their commitment is not just what they say but what they do.\""}
{"context": "Hallie Biden photographed arriving at Hunter Biden's trial on Thursday with her husband\n\nHunter Biden's ex-girlfriend has testified that she \"panicked\" when she searched his car and found a gun - a moment that set off a chaotic string of events that has brought the president's son to a federal courtroom. Hallie Biden, who is also the widow of the defendant's late brother Beau, said that she had discovered the revolver amid piles of clothes and litter in the glove compartment of Hunter Biden's truck. The Delaware court will begin hearing from two more witnesses on Friday as prosecutors present their remaining evidence to jurors. It is unclear if Mr Biden himself will testify in what is the first trial for the son of a sitting US president. The 54-year-old is accused of lying on a form about his drug use when he purchased the gun and ammunition on 12 October 2018 in Wilmington, Delaware. He could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted. Mr Biden has pleaded not guilty to three charges related to his possession of a firearm while allegedly using narcotics. His defence team says he was in recovery at the time, so was truthful when he indicated on the paperwork that he was not a drug user. On Thursday, the court heard from Hallie Biden, a central figure in the case who became romantically involved with the defendant shortly after the 2015 death of his brother and her husband. Ms Biden, 50, told the court she was \"embarrassed and ashamed\" to have started smoking crack cocaine herself after Mr Biden introduced her to the drug. In often emotional, detailed testimony, she spoke of the pair's \"volatile\" and \"off-on\" relationship, as well as their struggles with drug use and agonising battles to recover. Ms Biden testified that she had stopped using the drug in August 2018, but that Hunter Biden had continued to use it.

Fearful, she wrapped the .38 calibre Colt Cobra revolver into a leather pouch, stuffed it into a purple \"little gift shopping bag\" and drove to a nearby grocery store, where she threw it in a rubbish bin. \"I realise it was a stupid idea now,\" she said. \"But I was panicking.\" Initially, she did not plan to tell Mr Biden about what she had done. But when he woke up that morning, he realised it was missing. \"Did you take that from me Hallie,\" read one angry text shown to jurors. \"You really need to help me think right now, Hallie. This is very serious.\" At his urging, she returned to the store to find the gun but was unable to. She then filed a police report. \"I'll take the blame,\" she texted him from the scene. \"I don't want to live like this.\" It has previously emerged that the weapon was discovered by a man who often rummaged through the grocery store’s refuse to gather recyclable items. Ms Biden also told the court that she had not see Mr Biden use crack cocaine in the days leading up to him buying the gun and her disposing of it. As she testified, Hunter Biden appeared to look intently in her direction. He also looked back at his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, who has attended each day of the trial so far.\n\nHunter Biden and his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, photographed entering court on Thursday\n\nHallie Biden also told the court that it was only after their relationship began that she had learned of Mr Biden's drug use. She found crack cocaine at her house - where he would frequently stay - and later repeatedly saw him use the drug. Crack, she said, left him \"agitated or high-strung, but at other times, functioning as well\". The prosecutor asked on Thursday about a text message Hunter Biden had sent to Ms Biden the day after he bought the gun, saying he was waiting for a dealer named Mookie. She told the court that had meant \"he was buying crack cocaine\". Two days after the gun purchase, he texted Ms Biden that he was \"sleeping on a car smoking crack\". The series of texts also included several emotional messages from Ms Biden in which she pleaded with him to get sober. \"I'm afraid you're going to die,\" one message read. The defendant's lawyers explained the texts by suggesting their client had been lying about drug use to avoid seeing Hallie Biden - noting that she had had no way of knowing what he was actually doing at the time. During cross-examination, Ms Biden confirmed she had not seen him using drugs around this time. Abbe Lowell, Mr Biden's attorney, asked her whether the request to \"help me get sober\" could have also referred to alcohol - to which she agreed. Ms Biden's testimony was followed by Millard Greer, a former Delaware State Police lieutenant who recovered the weapon, as well as Edward Banner, an 80-year-old pensioner who found the weapon while looking for recyclables in the grocery store's bins. As his son appears in court, President Joe Biden has continued his public duties. On Thursday, he delivered a speech in France to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day. In an interview with ABC News on the same day, Mr Biden said he would accept the outcome of his son's trial and would not pardon him if convicted. Hunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4m (£1.1m) in taxes."}
{"context": "Blake Lively has filed a legal complaint against It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni, alleging sexual harassment and a campaign to \"destroy\" her reputation. According to the legal filing, she accuses Mr Baldoni and his team of attacking her public image following a meeting in which she brought along her actor husband, Ryan Reynolds, to address \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Mr Baldoni and a producer on the movie. Mr Baldoni's legal team told the BBC the allegations are \"categorically false\" and said they hired a crisis manager because Ms Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met. In the romantic drama, Ms Lively plays a woman who finds herself in a relationship with a charming but abusive boyfriend, played by Mr Baldoni.\n\nThe meeting between Ms Lively and Mr Baldoni, together with others involved in the movie's production, took place on 4 January this year, and it aimed to address \"the hostile work environment\" on set, says the legal filing. Ms Lively's husband, Deadpool star Mr Reynolds, who did not appear in It Ends With Us, joined her at the showdown, according to the legal complaint, which is one step before a lawsuit. Mr Baldoni, 40, attended the meeting in his capacity as co-chairman and co-founder of the company that produced the film, Wayfarer Studios. He was also the film's director. In the legal complaint, Ms Lively's lawyers allege that both Mr Baldoni and the Wayfarer chief executive officer, Jamey Heath, engaged in \"inappropriate and unwelcome behavior towards Ms Lively and others on the set of It Ends With Us\". In the filing to the California Civil Rights Department, a list of 30 demands relating to the pair's alleged misconduct was made at the meeting to ensure they could continue to produce the film. Among them, Ms Lively, 37, requested that there be no more mention of Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath's previous \"pornography addiction\" to Ms Lively or to other crew members, no more descriptions of their own genitalia to Ms Lively, and \"no more adding of sex scenes, oral sex, or on camera climaxing by BL [Blake Lively] outside the scope of the script BL approved when signing onto the project\", says the complaint. Ms Lively also demanded that Mr Baldoni stop saying he could speak to her dead father.\n\nIt Ends With Us has sparked some controversy over how the film depicts domestic violence\n\nMs Lively's legal team further accuse Mr Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios of leading a \"multi-tiered plan\" to wreck her reputation. She alleges this was \"the intended result of a carefully crafted, coordinated, and resourced retaliatory scheme to silence her, and others from speaking out about the hostile environment that Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath created\". Responding to the legal complaint, Mr Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said on Saturday: \"It is shameful that Ms Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.\" Mr Freedman accused Ms Lively of making numerous demands and threats, including \"threatening to not show up to set, threatening to not promote the film\", which would end up \"ultimately leading to its ", "continuation": "demise during release, if her demands were not met\". He alleged that Ms Lively's claims were \"intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media\". In a statement via her attorneys to the BBC, Ms Lively said: \"I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\" She also denied that she or any of her representatives had planted or spread negative information about Mr Baldoni or Wayfarer.\n\nThe film was a box-office hit, although some critics said it romanticised domestic violence. Soon after the release date in August, another co-star, Brandon Sklenar, hinted in an Instagram post at rumours of a rift between Ms Lively and Mr Baldoni. Speculation of a falling out only grew when they did not appear together on the red carpet. It Ends With Us tells the story of Boston florist Lily Bloom, played by Ms Lively, as she navigates a love triangle between her charming but abusive boyfriend, Ryle Kincaid, played by Mr Baldoni, and her compassionate first love, Atlas Corrigan, played by Mr Sklenar. It is based on a best-selling novel by Colleen Hoover. The 45-year-old author has previously said her inspiration was domestic abuse her mother endured.\n\nLively posed for photos with Sklenar (left) and her husband Ryan Reynolds at the premiere, but not her co-star Baldoni\n\nIn an interview with the BBC at the film's premiere in August, Ms Lively said she had felt the \"responsibility of servicing the people that care so much about the source material\". \"I really feel like we delivered a story that's emotional and it's fun, but also funny, painful, scary, tragic and it's inspiring and that's what life is, it's every single colour,\" said the actress. Ms Lively, who is also credited as a producer, told the BBC she felt the film had been made \"with lots of empathy\". \"Lily is a survivor and a victim and while they are huge labels, these are not her identity,\" said Ms Lively. \"She defines herself and I think it's deeply empowering that no one else can define you.\""}

The Crown of Thorns - comprising a circle of rushes encased in a crystal and gold tube - was brought back to the newly restored cathedral in a ceremony overseen by the Archbishop of Paris, Laurent Ulrich. The crown was acquired by King Louis IX of France in Constantinople in 1239 for 135,000 livres - nearly half France's annual expenditure at the time.

{"context": "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has said he does not regret voting to block UK military action against then Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2013. Prime Minister at the time David Cameron wanted to attack Syria, after reports Assad had used chemical weapons on his own citizens. However, Miliband, who was then leading Labour, directed his MPs to vote against the proposal, preventing the UK from taking part in any action. He was forced to respond after cabinet colleague Health Secretary Wes Streeting questioned that decision.\n\nAppearing on the BBC's Q", "continuation": "uestion Time on Thursday, the health secretary, who was not an MP at the time, said: \"With hindsight, I think we can say looking back on the events of 2013 the hesitation of this country and the US created a vacuum that Russia moved into and kept Assad in power for much longer.\" He added: \"What we can not say is that the back of Assad is going to lead to a better Syria.\" In a post on X on Friday, Streeting insisted his comments were not directed at the former Labour leader. \"On the contrary, I pointed out the challenges of hindsight, Libya and the uncertainty we face about post-Assad Syria today. \"It is frustrating, to put it mildly, to see a nuanced answer to a complicated issue presented as criticism of a good colleague,\" he said. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme if he agreed with Streeting's Question Time argument, Miliband said: \"No, I don't.\" \"I believe after what happened in Iraq, where hundreds of British troops died and thousands were injured, we could not commit British military forces without a clear plan. \"As to the question about whether it would have led to the end of Assad, the truth is in 2017 and 2018 Donald Trump bombed Assad and it did not lead to the end of Assad. \"I welcome the fall of a brutal dictator… but those people who say if only we had taken military action he would have somehow fallen - I just frankly don't believe it.\" Asked about the differing views between the two ministers, a No 10 spokesman said the government's priority was \"the safety of civilians and the peaceful transfer of power\" in Syria. \"Obviously I'm not going to comment on something that alludes to a period pre-this government,\" the prime minister's spokesman said. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who voted for military action in 2013, said he regretted the House of Commons as a whole did not. \"We were working with President Obama because Assad had used chemical weapons against his own people,\" he said. \"And international law said we should have acted.\"\n\nLast week, Assad fled to Russia after rebel forces seized control of the Syrian capital, ending decades of rule by the Assad family. During his rule, Human Rights Watch documented at least 85 chemical weapons attacks in Syria, the majority of which it said were carried out by the Syrian government - something they have denied. Victims of the chemical attacks have been speaking to the BBC, including Tawfiq Diam, whose wife and four children were killed in 2018. In 2013, Cameron said use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government was \"morally indefensible\" and asked MPs to approve the principle of taking military action to deter further use of such weapons. The military action would have taken the form of US-led air strikes rather than an on the ground invasion. The motion was defeated by 285 votes to 272, with Labour, 30 Conservatives and nine Lib Dems voting against. Following the vote, Cameron said it was clear Parliament did not want to take action and that he would \"act accordingly\". Although then-US President Barack Obama has said the he would punish any use of chemical weapons by Syria, he did not act, in part because of a lack of support from other allies including the UK. Conservatives expressed anger at the time, accusing Miliband of initially promising Cameron his support but later changing his mind. There were reports Miliband had been warned that if he backed military action he could face a rebellion from his own MPs, many of whom were still bruised by the Labour government's involvement in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

{"context": "Von der Leyen nominated to stay on in top EU job\n\nEmmanuel Macron (right) was among the EU leaders who reached a consensus to nominate Ursula von der Leyen (left) for a second term\n\nEU leaders have nominated current European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen for a second five-year term in the bloc's top job at a summit in Brussels. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas was picked as the EU's next foreign affairs chief and former Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa was chosen as the next chairman of EU summits. All three candidates are from centrist, pro-EU factions. The European Parliament is due to vote on the nominations for Ms von der Leyen and Ms Kallas.\n\nMs von der Leyen is from Germany’s centre-right, Mr Costa is a socialist and Ms Kallas a liberal. The leadership package represents continuity for the EU at a time of geopolitical uncertainty. It comes despite a surge in support for hard-right parties in the European Parliament elections earlier this month. But there has been resistance from Italy’s Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni. Before the summit she said the plans ignored the successes of hard-right parties like her own in the recent elections for the European Parliament. Ms Meloni has worked on cultivating a constructive relationship with the EU political mainstream, but she abstained from the vote for Ms von der Leyen and voted against Mr Costa and Ms Kallas. Ms Meloni, who heads the right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) bloc in the European Parliament, was notably not included in talks on the nominations despite the fact that the ECR became the third largest group in the parliament following the European elections. Addressing the Italian parliament on Wednesday, she said angrily that European voters had asked the EU to \"take a different path to the one it has travelled on so far\". Without naming names, she criticised \"those who argue that citizens are not mature enough to take certain decisions, and [who believe] that oligarchy is essentially the only acceptable form of democracy\".\n• None Von der Leyen nominated to stay on in top EU job\n\nApproval from the European Parliament could be a trickier challenge. Ms von der Leyen needs 361 votes in order to be confirmed for a second term. Theoretically, support from the centre-right European People’s Party, liberals and social democrats would give her enough support. But it is a tight margin. Diplomats say Ms von der Leyen may seek to win Ms Meloni's backing by giving Italy a powerful post in the commission. \"I would plain and simply like to express my gratitude to the leaders who endorsed my nomination for second mandate as president of the European Commission,\" said Ms von der Leyen. If she is approved by the European Parliament, one of her main tasks will be to see how Brussels can keep supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia - something that could be complicated if Donald Trump wins November's presidential election in the US.\n\nEstonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas has been nominated as the EU's next foreign affairs chief\n\nMs Kallas is also a strong supporter of Ukraine and a hawkish critic of the Kremlin and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. Moscow put her on a list of wanted criminals after her government removed Soviet-era war monuments. Some critics have expressed concern that her uncompromising stance could be a hindrance in her new role as the EU’s top diplomat - both externally and within the bloc itself. Ms Kallas said she was \"really honoured by the support\" and described the role as an \"enormous responsibility\". \"My aim is definitely to work for European unity, protect European interests.\" Mr Costa praised Ms Kallas and Ms von der Leyen, saying: \"I'm sure our collaboration will be very successful to serve Europe and European citizens.\" \"Europe and the world are facing challenging moments, yes,\" he said after his nomination. \"But the European Union has demonstrated its resilience in the past, always finding strengths in the unity, and building unity between member states will be my main priority when I take up my position in December focused on putting on track the strategic agenda which European Council has approved today.\" Mr Costa, who resigned as prime minister last year, will replace Belgium's former Prime Minister Charles Michel.

Her comments came after BBC undercover researchers posed as a couple on a date, with a female researcher approaching bar staff appearing distressed and asking for Angela.

She said: \"None of these schemes are ever fit for purpose if they are not trained properly. \"New laws, things written down on fancy scrolls that sit in the basement of the House of Commons.\" Her comments come after the government announced new training initiatives around spiking. Phillips stressed the importance of maintaining ongoing training rather than venues by simply displaying posters. She said this was a type of \"pink-washing\" where a venue marketed itself as being supportive to women's rights but in practice did not take any positive action or measures. The term can also refer to breast cancer campaigns and LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nFollowing the BBC investigation, Cambridgeshire, West Midlands and Hertfordshire police forces announced they had conducted spot checks. The BBC findings mirror similar failures in the scheme's implementation reported by women's safety groups across other parts of the UK. Staff at large chains including Greene King and JD Wetherspoon were among those who did not recognise the code word. Greene King said it was concerned by the BBC's findings and pledged to review how the scheme was communicated to its teams, while JD Wetherspoon said it would provide additional training if necessary. Westminster City Council currently makes participation in the Ask for Angela scheme a key factor when deciding to grant alcohol licences.

A key pillar of achieving this in Wales is securing energy independence for our nation – including control over our natural resources through devolution of the £835m worth crown estate and full control over energy powers without any conditions set by the UK Government.\" On Friday, during the BBC's election debate, Conservative cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt said: \"What is critical is if you want to reach net zero by 2050 you have to do it with people [on board].\" \"We are going to do this at a pace that people can afford... if you do this too fast you destroy our supply chain.\" During the same debate Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform Party, said: \"At the moment we are pursuing completely unrealistic climate pledges. It is impossible and unaffordable.\" Stephen Flynn, Westminster leader of the SNP, said: \"Net Zero is economic growth, the opportunities are huge but we have to grasp them.\"\n\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

Gavin Plumb, 37, from Harlow, Essex, is accused of using the messaging app Kik to find others to help him abduct, rape and murder Ms Willoughby. The officer - who is based in the US and gave his evidence by video link with no image displayed - told jurors he was concerned Mr Plumb was \"looking for hitmen\" to carry out his alleged plot. Mr Plumb, on trial at Chelmsford Crown Court, has denied soliciting murder, inciting kidnap and inciting rape.\n\nThe officer, who used the pseudonym David Nelson to protect his identity, alleged the defendant was one of 50 active members in the Abduct Lovers group. \"What is discussed in that group is abductions, kidnap, rape and mu", "continuation": "rder of other individuals,\" Mr Nelson said.\n\nJurors were told Mr Plumb, a security guard, had a Kik account named \"BigBear341987\", and used an image of Ms Willoughby as his profile picture.

Mr Nelson, who told the court he had assumed a fake identity to engage with the defendant directly, said he replied \"nice\", before then speaking with Mr Plumb in a private chat. The officer told the jury: \"He said 'I know when she gets up in the morning', as well as not having security cameras where she was. \"I felt there was an imminent threat to this individual. It's very rare for an individual to post they have some potential information,\" Mr Nelson said. He confirmed he had held a \"meeting\" with \"representatives from the FBI\" because of his concerns.\n\nMr Plumb sat with his head bowed as Mr Nelson gave his evidence via a video link from the US\n\nThe court was told that Mr Plumb sent Mr Nelson a video of a \"kidnap kit\" he had assembled, including hand and ankle shackles, a rope and a ball gag. \"He also indicated he had chloroform. I asked where the chloroform was and he sent me a photograph,\" Mr Nelson added.\n\nDuring his cross-examination by Sasha Wass KC, who is defending Mr Plumb, Mr Nelson said he did not initially know who Ms Willoughby was. Ms Wass suggested the Kik group involved \"vile material but nonetheless amounting to fantasy\". Mr Nelson responded \"correct\", and said he was \"trying to determine\" if Mr Plumb's alleged plot was fantasy or \"something more for him\". Ms Wass put it to Mr Nelson that he could see Mr Plumb was \"significantly overweight\" from pictures he had been sent. She suggested this discounted the credibility of Mr Plumb's plan to \"jump the outer wall\" of Willoughby's house. Ms Wass asked: \"Knowing what he looked like and the state of his dimensions, did that cause you to revaluate the credibility of this plan?\" Mr Nelson responded: \"No, it did not.\" Mr Plumb's defence is expected to start on Friday. The trial continues."}

Highlights: Afghanistan reach T20 semi-finals for first time in their history\n\nAfghanistan qualified for the semi-finals of a World Cup for the first time by beating Bangladesh by eight runs in a tense low-scoring classic in St Vincent. The victory sees them progress as runners-up from Super 8s Group 1, while knocking Bangladesh as well as heavyweights Australia out of the tournament. They will now play South Africa in Trinidad on Thursday (01:30 BST), and are one match away from facing either defending T20 champions England or India in Saturday's final. Needing a win to advance to the knockout stage, Afghanistan underperformed with the bat, scoring 115-5. A rollercoaster, rain-interrupted run chase ensued, in which both sides and then Australia looked to be favourites to progress at different stages. Ultimately it was Afghanistan who emerged triumphant, with captain Rashid Khan and Naveen-ul-Haq taking four wickets apiece to secure a famous victory. Bangladesh, who were also seeking to reach their first World Cup semi-final, needed to win by a large margin to qualify on net run-rate (NRR). They successfully throttled the dangerous Afghanistan opening pair of Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran, who both fell to leg-spinner Rishad Hossain (3-26), but skipper Rashid hit three late sixes to boost the total. Bangladesh's target was revised to 114 off 19 overs, but they knew they had to knock off the runs in 12.1 overs to turn their overall NRR in the group in their favour. Opener Litton Das anchored the innings, ending on 54 not out, but they lost veteran Shakib al Hasan and captain Najmul Hossain Shanto to successive balls from Naveen in the third over. Despite failing with their own quest, the Tigers remained in contention for a consolation win that would have seen Australia qualify ahead of Afghanistan on NRR. But Naveen took the final two Bangladesh wickets in successive deliveries, either side of a short rain delay, to begin rapturous celebrations.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nFor Afghanistan, qualification for the semi-final is another step on the remarkable journey they have taken since first qualifying for a T20 World Cup in 2010. Having emerged from a labyrinth system of qualifying events in the 2000s, they have become regulars in the finals of tournaments yet have exited before the knockout rounds in their nine previous World Cup campaigns across both T20s and ODIs. They progressed from the first of the two group stages in this year's competition, securing the runners-up spot in Group C before losing heavily in their final match against West Indies and being easily beaten by India in the first match of the Super 8s. However, they came roaring back to defeat previously unbeaten Australia on Sunday and put themselves in the driving seat for semi-final qualification. Much of their success in this tournament has been based on the mountain of runs scored by openers Gurbaz and Zadran, but the pair found themselves becalmed against Bangladesh, reaching 58 at the halfway stage of the first innings. Zadran fell shortly after that while Gurbaz failed to push on, finally falling for 43 off 56 balls in the 17th over, ", "continuation": "his side just scraping past the 100 mark in the penultimate over. Bangladesh had to be bold to have a chance of progressing and fell to 23-3 within three overs. They nevertheless continued to edge towards their target around short rain showers, provoking irritated reactions on the boundary from Jonathan Trott, who has coached Afghanistan since 2022. But the former England batter could rely on his bank of quality bowlers to ensure another chapter in Afghanistan's storied cricketing journey was written in St Vincent.\n\nProgress to the semi-finals was greeted by public celebrations in Afghanistan. Because of the country's security situation, they have never played a full men's international on home soil, with Afghanistan's fixtures instead held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where a number of their players are based. Trott himself has actually never visited Afghanistan, where the Taliban returned to power in August 2021 emboldened by the withdrawal of US and other international forces. The Taliban's return saw the Afghanistan's women's national team disbanded. Many of Afghanistan's women's players were forced into hiding before fleeing the country and some international cricket sides have boycotted matches against their men's team outside of tournaments as a result. In March, Australia's men pulled out of a three-match series that was scheduled to take place in the UAE in August - the third time they have declined to play Afghanistan. The International Cricket Council told BBC Sport last year it will \"continue to constructively use its influence\" to assist the Afghanistan Cricket Board in \"developing cricket and playing opportunities for both men and women\"."}

It is out of communication for several days during this burning hot fly-by and scientists will be waiting for a signal, expected at 05:00 GMT on 28 December, to see if it has survived. The hope is the probe could help us to better understand how the Sun works.\n\nDr Nicola Fox, head of science at Nasa, told BBC News: \"For centuries, people have studied the Sun, but you don't experience the atmosphere of a place until you actually go visit it. \"And so we can't really experience the atmosphere of our star unless we fly through it.\"\n\nThe spacecraft will be flying into the Sun's outer atmosphere\n\nParker Solar Probe launched in 2018, heading to the centre of our solar system. It has already swept past the Sun 21 times, getting ever nearer, but the Christmas Eve visit is record-breaking. At its closest approach, the probe is 3.8 million miles (6.2 million km) from our star's surface. This might not sound that close, but Nasa's Nicola Fox puts it into perspective: \"We are 93 million miles away from the Sun, so if I put the Sun and the Earth one metre apart, Parker Solar Probe is four centimetres from the Sun - so that's close.\" The probe will have to endure temperatures of 1,400C and radiation that could frazzle the onboard electronics. It is protected by a 11.5cm (4.5 inches) thick carbon-composite shield but the spacecraft's tactic is to get in and out fast. In fact, it will be moving faster than any human-made object, hurtling at 430,000mph - the equivalent of flying from London to New York in less than 30 seconds.

When these particles interact with the Earth's magnetic field the sky lights up with dazzling auroras.

Nicola Fox says that as soon as a signal is beamed back home, the team will text her a green heart to let her know the probe is OK. She admits she is nervous about the audacious attempt, but she has faith in the probe. \"I will worry about the spacecraft.

{"context": "Legislation changes are being considered to completely stop the use of three specific pesticides that harm bees\n\nEmergency use of three pesticides that can be deadly to bees will soon be stopped for good, the government has said. Neonicotinoids were banned in 2018 but sugar beet farmers have been given special permission to use them every year for the past four years to fight virus yellows, a disease spread by aphids. The government announced on Saturday that it would be looking at \"legislative options\" that would legally prevent all future use of three specific neonicotinoids. In the meantime, an application for emergency use in 2025 by the National Farmers' Union (NFU) and British Sugar will still have to be considered under existing laws.\n\nCraig Bennett, of The Wildlife Trusts, said emergency authorisation for use should not be granted for 2025\n\nThe two organisations said industry work on developing alternative ways of fighting the disease – which has caused crop losses of up to 80% in the past – was \"progressing well\". The NFU added that simply having a list of banned products for which there could be no emergency authorisation for use \"could set a worrying precedent\" but wildlife organisations have welcomed the government's announcement. Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said there was \"no place in British agriculture for toxic bee-killing pesticides\". He added that the government's decision \"must not be undermined by granting the emergency use of neonicotinoids next year\".\n\nVirus yellows has destroyed up to 80% of sugar beet crops in the past\n\nJenna Hegarty, head of policy at the Nature Friendly Farming Network (NFFN), said the decision was \"long overdue\". The current application for emergency use authorisation is for Cruiser SB, a neonicotinoid used as a seed treatment. Although the application process will still go ahead under the law as it stands, the government said it would be reviewing guidance to ensure \"full account\" is taken of the risks to pollinators in any decision made by the Secretary of State. Studies have shown that neonicotinoids can be extremely toxic to pollinators and, even at doses that are not directly fatal to bees, they can cause cognitive problems that impact bees' foraging abilities and the productivity of hives. Banning emergency authorisations was a key election pledge of Labour and the government said on Saturday that it would be consulting on the plan and identifying the potential changes to legislation needed.\n\nA future complete ban would cover neonicotinoid products containing ", "continuation": "clothianidin, imidacloprid or thiamethoxam.

In a joint statement, Michael Sly, the chairman of the NFU's sugar board, and Dan Green, agriculture director for British Sugar – which supplies 60% of the UK's sugar - said there was still an \"ongoing risk\" from virus yellows. But they said the pesticide would only be used on seeds if a certain threshold of threat – set by government – was met and any use would be strictly managed. They added that the industry was dedicated to finding \"sustainable solutions\" to tackling crop disease. \"We have seen developments across several areas, including in gene editing, conventional breeding techniques and several novel integrated pest management trials which are showing promise,\" they said. British Sugar has previously said it hopes virus yellows-resistant crops will be available commercially by 2026."}

The defending champions struggled through the group stage, only progressing on net run-rate at the expense of Scotland. They came through their Super 8s pool in second behind South Africa and now face unbeaten India in Guyana on Thursday at 15:30 BST. \"We haven't quite clicked as a whole unit yet,\" Mott told the BBC. \"Bits and pieces have worked at different times but our 'A-game' is certainly enough to match with India.\"\n\nIndia have eased through the tournament, impressively beating Australia by 24 runs on Monday to top their Super 8s group. England were beaten by Australia in the first group stage and also lost to South Africa in the Super 8s. After their first match against Scotland was washed out, they needed heavy victories against Oman and Namibia to avoid an early exit. \"We've had to play some ugly cricket at times,\" added Mott. \"But from here on in it's time to be the frontrunners. \"It's time to more or less throw the first punch at India and then try to get our nose in front and never give it back.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nMuch of the discussion before the semi-final has been around the lack of a reserve day and there is rain forecast for Thursday. The first semi-final between South Africa and Afghanistan has a rain reserve day but England's meeting with India does not. Instead, there are 250 minutes available throughout the afternoon on Thursday - the same total available across the two days in Trinidad - to fit in a match. If no result is possible, India will progress, as they won their Super 8s group. Mott said in an \"ideal world\", there would be a reserve day and it is something the International Cricket Council \"need to look at long term\". There has also been criticism, external of the fact India's semi-final venue, in the event of their qualification, was predetermined, whereas other sides had to wait for their route to be confirmed, but Mott played down the significance of the latter issue. “We were quite aware there was every chance that we'd be here in Guyana,” he said. “We've had to fight our way through this tournament and it's something that's galvanised us as a group and will hold us in really good stead for cut-throat matches.” A surface suiting spinners is expected at Providence Stadium, which could help India, whose squad includes four spinners and batters who grew up on low surfaces. England have uncapped left-arm spinner Tom Hartley in their squad, who could come into contention for a debut. But Australian Mott, who was speaking before England's training and prior to seeing the pitch, said he does not expect \"drastic changes\". The match is a repeat of the semi-final of the last T20 World Cup in Australia, where a superb England thrashed India by 10 wickets in Adelaide en route to winning the title. Mott said India, who timidly posted 168-6 that night before England chased the target in 16 overs, are a more aggressive side this year. \"We're not looking back at all with this group,\" he added. \"One of its big mantras is staying present. \"They are a different team, too, than when we took them on.\"\n• None Get cricket news sent straight to your phone"}

But he said it was not yet clear whether they were detonated remotely or by suicide attackers.\n\nThe hardline Tasnim news agency, which is affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guards, earlier cited sources as saying that \"two bags carrying bomb\" were apparently detonated \"by remote control\".\n\n\"We were walking towards the cemetery when a car suddenly stopped behind us and a waste bin containing a bomb exploded,\" a witness was quoted by Isna news agency as saying.\n\n\"We only heard the sound of the explosion and saw people falling.\"\n\nThe Iranian Red Crescent said the dead included at least one paramedic who was sent to the scene of the first explosion and was hit by the second.\n\nInterior Minister Ahmad Vahid said the second blast killed and wounded the most people, and that an investigation had been launched to determine who was behind the attack.\n\nState television says the blasts occurred in quick succession in the southern city of Kerman\n\nPresident Ebrahim Raisi called the bombings a \"cowardly act\" carried out by \"Iran-hating criminals and the henchmen of terror and darkness\".\n\nUN Secretary General António Guterres strongly condemned the attack and expressed his \"deep condolences to the bereaved families and the people and the government\" of Iran, his spokesman said.\n\nAs commander of the Revolutionary Guards' overseas operations arm, the Quds Force, Soleimani was an architect of Iranian policy across the region.\n\nHe was in charge of the Quds Force's clandestine missions and its provision of guidance, funding, weapons, intelligence, and logistical support to allied governments and armed groups, including Hezbollah and Hamas.\n\nThen-US President Donald Trump, who ordered the 2020 drone strike, described Soleimani as \"the number-one terrorist anywhere in the world\" and alleged that troops under his command had murdered hundreds of American civilians and servicemen over the previous two decades.\n\nIran's government accused the US of an act of international terrorism and issued arrest warrants for Mr Trump and other officials.\n\nAre you in the affected area?

{"context": "2023 was supposed to be Flo's year. A few months before the calendar flipped over, the London-based girl band made a huge splash with their debut single, Cardboard Box, a sassy kiss-off to a cheating ex that drew on the girl group sounds of En Vogue, SWV and Destiny's Child. Selling 205,000 copies, the song helped the trio top the BBC's Sound Of 2023 poll (beating Fred Again into second place) and become the first girl group to win the Brits' Rising Star prize. Hot on the heels of those accolades, they scored their first Top 40 hit with Fly Girl – featuring a rare guest spot from the elusive Missy Elliot. The band's debut album Access All Areas was originally slated to drop last year, but it kept getting pushed back. Usually, that means trouble behind the scenes. Internal squabbles, personnel issues, record label skullduggery. But Jorja Douglas, Renée Downer and Stella Quaresma dismiss those clichés. Instead, they say they were laser-focused on making the best album possible, even if it meant keeping fans waiting. \"We can't just release any old piece of music,\" says Douglas. \"We take it very seriously and, especially for our first album, we want to represent ourselves in the best way with the best message.\" In the end, that meant scrapping a huge number of completed tracks half-way through the recording sessions. They did so on the advice of LVRN (Love Renaissance), the US management company who helped launch the careers of Summer Walker and 6lack. \"They came on board during the recording process and they were like, 'Come on, guys, this ain't gonna cut it',\" recalls Downer. \"It was hard to hear because you become biased [towards the songs you have] but they really opened our eyes to the fact that we could do better. \"We're very open to criticism, even if we felt a little emotional at the time. \"But then we quickly realised that, OK, this is for the good.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. FLO perform their track \"In My Bag\", and cover festive classic \"This Christmas\".\n\nReinvigorated, they doubled their efforts, criss-crossing the Atlantic to work with new writers and producers while \"filling in the blanks\" in their lyrical themes and \"honing their sound\". \"It was a long process because it was very detailed,\" explains Downer. Released last month, Flo's debut album Access All Areas quickly picked up rave reviews. \"If a girl group's main job is to supply harmonies for days and kick out songs that roll around your head like marble, Access All Areas achieves it all,\" said Pitchfork, external, awarding the album 8 out of 10. DIY called it \"a definitive debut, external\" while Rolling Stone asked \"Are Flo the next great girl group?, external\" In the UK, the album entered the charts at number three – making Flo the highest-charting British R&B girl group in 23 years (matching the chart position of Mis-Teeq's debut album Lickin' On Both Sides). \"We're grateful everyone's enjoying it,\" says Douglas. \"It feels like our artistry is a bit more real, like we've got a bit more credit to our names and we're moving in the right direction.\"\n\nFlo's hits include Walk Like This, Check, Cardboard Box and Fly Girl\n\nFrom a certain perspective, their success seems pre-ordained. Since the demise of Little Mix, there's been a girl band-shaped hole in the pop charts. And, because pop always travels in 20-year cycles, there's a renewed interest in the harmony-driven hits of the 2000s. Flo know those songs back-to-front. Although Quaresma \"wasn't even born\" when Mis-Teeq made the top three, the girls were all raised on the music of Brandy, Faith Evans and Mariah Carey. That education came at home. All three are only children, and all three were raised by music-loving single mums. The shared background helped them forge a unique bond – first at stage school, where Renee and Stella met, then during auditions for Flo, where they hooked up with Jorja. \"Being in a girl group is one thing, but finding each other has given it a totally different meaning,\" says Jorja. \"I wouldn't feel the same if I was with two other girls that kind of came from a different background. \"It's like we're one person that's got some kind of personality disorder!\"\n\nThat strength helped them hold firm when, in the early days, managers tried to change the band's line-up; and it made them fight for Cardboard Box to be their debut single, against record lab", "continuation": "el advice. Studying R&B taught them more than how to harmonise – it showed them how the music industry, particularly in the UK, can be stacked against black women. Time after time, promising artists like Jamelia, Sadie Ama and even Raye have been let down by labels that don't know how to promote R&B to a UK audience. Others, like Mahalia and Ella Mai, have focused on breaking the US, where the genre has deeper roots. \"That's the music I love the most, and it's probably the hardest music to sell in this country,\" Radio 2's Trevor Nelson told The Guardian last year, external. \"It just is. It's always been.\" On the album track, I'm Just A Girl, Flo address that situation over a dark, electronic beat. \"How many black girls do you see on centre stage now? / Yet you wonder why they going to the States now.\" \"I actually think we've been pretty lucky, but we've definitely seen little comments here and there, or people not being accustomed to the music that we make,\" says Douglas. \"When we go out in the UK, people love R&B, but I think people who make the decisions in the industry in the UK aren't so familiar with it. So I think it can make people feel a little bit unappreciated. \"I think what sets us apart is that we speak about it,\" says Downer. \"We're all thinking it, all the R&B artists in the UK. We're not content with making music and it reaching fewer people. \"We're very happy that we're starting to be seen as the catalyst for change,\" adds Quaresma, \"but it's obviously a problem\". For now, the trio are playing the game. The first single from Access All Areas was the irresistibly catchy Walk Like This, a pop hit in R&B clothing. Then they targeted urban radio with the slinky, serpentine grooves of Caught Up. \"We're constantly doing a push and pull between 'this is a bit more pop-leaning, and this is more R&B',\" says Downer. \"We have to be open to putting our pop foot first sometimes, because of the world that we live in. But a few years down the line, it's gonna be different.\"\n\nThe band collaborated with US rapper GloRilla (second left) on their debut album - and hint that more special guests will appear on an upcoming super-deluxe version of the record.\n\nR&B aficionados have already locked on to the band's deliciously seductive grooves. Wicked star Cynthia Erivo voices the introduction to their album, while the deluxe edition features guest appearances from Chlöe and Halle, GloRilla and Bree Runway. Last year, they were VIP guests on Beyoncé's Renaissance tour (\"Right next to her dad. It was a bit nerve-wracking, to be honest\") and they spent autumn on the road with US soul star Kehlani. \"It shows us the trajectory,\" says Downer. \"Obviously, we're not going to be doing anything like Renaissance for years – but it's nice to start envisioning the road map of our live shows.\" Which reminds me: The last time we spoke to Flo was in 2022, and they'd just been given treadmills, so they could build up the stamina to sing and run at the same time. How did that work out? \"It didn't last that long,\" admits Quaresma. \"Mine got sold.\" The lack of stamina came back to bite them on their US tour - not on stage, but at an afterparty. \"We were in New Orleans and Kehlani insisted we try out a mechanical bull,\" says Downer. \"We were all very bad,\" laughs Quaresma. \"It's much harder than it looks.\" \"I thought I had the core strength but, really, I did not,\" says Douglas. \"It's not just core strength,\" Downer adds. \"It's thighs, it's legs, it's arms.\" \"Maybe, for the next tour, we should just get mechanical bulls instead of treadmills.\""}

Mexico's official electoral authority said preliminary results showed the 61-year-old former mayor of Mexico City winning between 58% and 60% of the vote in Sunday's election. That gives her a lead of about 30 percentage points over her main rival, businesswoman Xóchitl Gálvez. Ms Sheinbaum will replace her mentor, outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, on 1 October.\n\nThe election of a woman to the highest office was an emotional moment for some\n\nMs Sheinbaum, a former energy scientist, has promised continuity, saying that she will continue to build on the \"advances\" made by Mr López Obrador, further building on the welfare programmes which have made the outgoing president very popular. But in her victory speech she also highlighted what has set this Mexican election apart from previous ones. She told cheering voters: \"For the first time in the 200 years of the [Mexican] Republic, I will become the first woman president of Mexico.\" She said it was an achievement not just for her but for all women. \"I've said it from the start, this is not just about me getting [to the top office], it's about all of us getting here.\" Ms Sheinbaum also thanked her rival, Xóchitl Gálvez, who has conceded victory.\n\nPrior to running for president, Ms Sheinbaum was mayor of Mexico City, one of the most influential political positions in the country and one that is seen as paving the way for the presidency. Ms Sheinbaum, whose Jewish maternal grandparents immigrated to Mexico from Bulgaria fleeing the Nazis, had an illustrious career as a scientist before delving into politics. Her paternal grandparents hailed from Lithuania. Both of her parents were scientists and Ms Sheinbaum studied physics bef", "continuation": "ore going on to receive a doctorate in energy engineering. She spent years at a renowned research lab in California studying Mexican energy consumption patterns and became an expert on climate change. That experience and her student activism eventually earned her the position of secretary of the environment for Mexico City at the time when Andrés Manuel López Obrador was mayor of the capital. In 2018 she became the first female mayor of Mexico City, a post she held until 2023, when she stepped down to run for president.\n\nSupporters of Claudia Sheinbaum gathered at the Zócalo to celebrate\n\nThe election, which pitted Ms Sheinbaum against Ms Gálvez, has been described as a sea change for women in Mexico. Edelmira Montiel, 87, said that she was grateful to be alive to see a woman elected to the top office. \"Before, we couldn't even vote, and when you could, it was to vote for the person your husband told you to vote for. Thank God that has changed and I get to live it,\" she told Reuters news agency, referring to the fact that women were only allowed to vote in national elections in 1953. While the fact that the two front-runners were women was widely celebrated, the campaign was marred by violent attacks. As well as a new president, voters were also electing all members of Mexico's Congress and governors in eight states, the head of Mexico City's government, and thousands of local officials. And it was local candidates in particular who were targeted in the run-up to the vote. The government says more than 20 were killed across Mexico, although other surveys put the total at 37. Ms Gálvez harshly criticised the government and her rival in the presidential race for the violence which blights large parts of Mexico. She promised to be \"the bravest president, a president who does confront crime\" if elected, but failed to provide many details about how she would tackle the powerful criminal cartels which are behind much of the violence. After Ms Sheinbaum's lead became unassailable, Ms Gálvez called her. \"I told her I saw a Mexico with a lot of pain and violence. I wished that she could solve the severe problems our people have,” Ms Gálvez said of the call.\n\nHow to tackle Mexico's violent cartels is going to be one of the many challenges facing Ms Sheinbaum when she takes up office. She has said that it is important to tackle what she says are the roots of the violence and has promised to invest in welfare programmes to prevent poor young Mexicans from being recruited by criminal groups. On relations with Mexico's northern neighbour, the United States, which at times have been testy under her predecessor in office, she said she would ensure there would be \"a relationship of friendship, mutual respect and equality\". But in a reference to the many Mexicans living and working in the US, she promised to \"always defend the Mexicans who are on the other side of the border”. Relations between the US and Mexico suffered under Mr López Obrador, who has been in power since 2018. The outspoken leader was barred from running for a second term under Mexico's constitution, which limits presidents to a single six-year-term. He threw his weight behind Ms Sheinbaum instead. Having the backing of the popular president, who has an approval rate of close to 60%, gave Ms Sheinbaum's campaign a huge boost. Many of those voting for her said they backed her and Mr López Obrador's party programme to alleviate poverty and wanted to see it continued.

{"context": "Woman searching for birth parents found dad was a friend on Facebook\n\nTamuna's search for her birth parents took eight years\n\nTamuna Museridze took a deep breath and made the phone call she had dreamed of since finding out that she might be adopted. She was calling the woman she believed was her biological mother. She knew it might not lead to a fairy tale reunion - but she didn't expect the response to be cold and angry. “She started screaming, shouting - she said she hadn’t given birth to a child. She didn't want anything to do with me,” Tamuna recalls, explaining she felt more surprised than upset by the response. “I was ready for anything, but her reaction was beyond anything I could imagine.” Tamuna wasn’t prepared to walk away just yet. She wanted to know the circumstances of her adoption, and there was something else she wanted that only her mother could give her - the name of her father. Tamuna’s search had begun in 2016, after the woman who raised her died. Clearing out her house, Tamuna found a birth certificate with her own name on it but the wrong birth date, and she started to suspect she was adopted. After doing some research, she set up a Facebook group called Vedzeb, or I’m Searching, hoping to find her birth parents. Instead, she uncovered a baby trafficking scandal in Georgia that has affected tens of thousands of lives. Over many decades, parents were lied to and told their newborn babies had died – the infants were then sold. Tamuna is a journalist and her work has reunited hundreds of families, yet - until now - she couldn’t solve the mystery of her own origins and wondered if she too had been stolen as a child. “I was a journalist on this story, but it was a personal mission for me as well,” she says.\n\nTamuna had already helped reunite other families through a Facebook group, including identical twins Ano (L) and Amy (R) and their birth mother Aza (C) - they were stolen, separated and sold at birth\n\nThe breakthrough in her search had come in the summer, when she received a message through her Facebook group. It was from someone who lived in rural Georgia, who said they knew a woman who had concealed a pregnancy and given birth in Tbilisi in September 1984. That’s around the time Tamuna was born - a date she had shared publicly. The person believed the woman was Tamuna’s birth mother - and crucially they gave a name. Tamuna immediately searched for her online but when she couldn’t find anything, she decided to post an appeal on Facebook asking if anyone knew her. A woman soon responded, saying the woman who had concealed the pregnancy was her own aunt. She asked Tamuna to take the post down but she agreed to do a DNA test.\n\nWhile they were waiting for the results, Tamuna made the phone call to her mother. A week later, the DNA results arrived, indicating that Tamuna and the woman on Facebook were indeed cousins. Armed with this evidence, Tamuna managed to convince her mother to acknowledge the truth and reveal the name of her father. It was a man called Gurgen Khorava. “The first two months were shocking, I couldn’t believe these things were happening to me,” she recalls, “I couldn’t believe I had found them.” Once Tamuna had Gurgen’s name, she quickly tracked him down on Facebook. It turned out that he had been following her story on social media - her work reconnecting families is widely known across Georgia. Tamuna was amazed to find that he had “been in my friend list for three years”. He just hadn’t realised he was a part of her story. “He didn’t even know my birth mother had been pregnant,” says Tamuna. “It was a huge surprise for him.\" They soon arranged to meet in his hometown of Zugdidi in western Georgia – about 160 miles (260km) from where she lives in Tbilisi.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch the moment the pair meet for the first time\n\nLooking back, Tamuna thinks she was in a state of shock, but as she walked up to Gurgen’s garden gate, she felt surprisingly calm. When the 72-year-old appeared, they hugged, then stopped to take a moment to look at each other, smiling. “It was strange, the moment he looked at me, he knew that I was his daughter,” she recalls. “I had so many mixed emotions.” She had a lot of questions and didn’t know where to start. “We just sat together, watching each other and trying to find something in common,” she says. As the two of them chatted, they realised they shared a lot of interests - Gurgen had once been a renowned dancer at the State Ballet of Georgia, and was delighted to learn that Tamuna’s daughters - his granddaughters - shared his passion. “They both love dancing, and so does my husband,” she says with a smile.\n\nTamuna (L) with her newly-found half sister Rusiko (C) and cousin Manoni (R), who Gurgen introduced her to\n\nGurgen invited his entire family to his home to meet Tamuna, introducing her to a large group of new relatives - half siblings, cousins, aunts, and uncles. The family agreed there was a strong resemblance between them. “Out of all his children, I look the most like my father,” she says. They spent an evening sharing stories, eating traditional Georgian food, and singing while Gurgen played the accordion. Even though she had now met her father, Tamuna still had a niggling question: had she - like thousands of other Georgians - been stolen from her mother at birth and sold? Her adoptive parents were no longer alive so she couldn’t turn to them for answers. She finally got a chance to ask her birth mother in October. A Polish TV company was filming a documentary about Tamuna and took her to meet her mother, who agreed to talk to her in private. Unlike many people Tamuna has helped to reunite, she discovered that she had not been a stolen child", "continuation": " herself. Instead, her mother had given her up and kept the secret for 40 years.\n\nTamuna and Gurgen are in regular contact and plan to see each other over Christmas\n\nHer mother and father were not in a relationship and had only had a brief encounter. Her mother - overwhelmed by shame - chose to hide her pregnancy. In September 1984, she travelled to Tbilisi, telling people she was going for surgery, and instead gave birth to a daughter. She stayed there until arrangements were made for Tamuna’s adoption. “It was painful to learn that I spent 10 days alone with her before the adoption. I try not to think about that,” Tamuna reflects. She says that her mother asked her to lie and tell people she had been stolen. “She told me that if I would not say that I was stolen, everything would end between us… and I said that I couldn’t do that.\" Tamuna feels this would be unfair to all the parents whose babies were stolen. “If I lie, nobody's going to believe those mothers any more,” she explains. Her mother then asked her to leave the house and they have not spoken since. “Would I do it all again?” she reflects. “Of course I would, I found out so much about my new family.”\n\nTamuna (R) has become close to many of her biological relatives including Nia (L) who is a second cousin\n\nTwins Amy and Ano were taken from their mother as babies and sold.

It is a charge that cannot be levelled at him over his squad for ", "continuation": "Euro 2024 in Germany. There will be justified claims that Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite should have got the nod ahead of Brighton central defender Lewis Dunk, but elsewhere Southgate has been ruthless and got it right. The omission of Manchester City's Jack Grealish may be the big talking point - but has he played well enough this season to be selected ahead of Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze, Newcastle United wide man Anthony Gordon or West Ham United's consistently excellent Jarrod Bowen? Has Tottenham's James Maddison done enough to edge in ahead of a similar group? In November the answer would have been in the affirmative. Southgate, in answer to his critics, has gone with form and made the bold, big calls that look correct when examined in the current context. And what a reflection on the fine work going on at Crystal Palace they are. Adam Wharton has come from nowhere to be the \"bolter\" in England's squad but his brilliant cameo against Bosnia-Herzegovina on Monday told Southgate all he needed to know. Wharton's calm and assured work on the ball, as well as a vision of what is going on around him, persuaded the manager that he should go to Germany. He has wowed Southgate and team-mates. Could he even make it for the opening game against Serbia?\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Southgate on the difficult decision to leave players out\n\nEze falls into the same category. Exciting and fearless - just what is needed at a major tournament. The Palace forward has edged in ahead of 28-year-old Grealish, a selection that is bound to spark much comment, especially as the Manchester City player is such a popular figure with England fans. Measured in football terms, however, Eze is the only choice Southgate could have made on form at the end of the season. If City manager Pep Guardiola was unconvinced by Grealish, why should Southgate feel different? This will, however, be a selection that will be thrown back at Southgate should England fail at Euro 2024. For the avoidance of doubt, this observer believes there is a very strong argument that Southgate has got it right. Manchester United central defender Harry Maguire is a different case. If he had been anywhere near fit he would have been selected. For all the conversation around his recent form at club level, Southgate would have pencilled him in to start against Serbia in Gelsenkirchen. Southgate will regard Maguire's absence as a serious blow. It means Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi is in line to partner John Stones, while Liverpool's Joe Gomez and Aston Villa defender Ezri Konsa add versatility and adaptability. England's squad has a bold and fresh look, feeding into the optimism that surrounds their chances at Euro 2024. Southgate has avoided the conundrum of deciding between Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins and Brentford's Ivan Toney as potential deputy to captain Harry Kane by picking both – adding to the feeling that England's manager is adopting a positive approach to his squad and Euro 2024. There will be much discussion around Southgate's picks for Germany, but his critics cannot accuse him of dodging the big decisions and this looks like an England squad that can travel to Germany with high hopes.\n\nThe Team Selector cannot be displayed in your browser.

Watch: Salome Zourabichvili spoke to the BBC's Steve Rosenberg on Saturday\n\nGeorgia's pro-Western president has said she will stay in post until new parliamentary elections are held, as protests continue over the government's decision to put EU accession negotiations on hold. Speaking to the BBC, Salome Zourabichvili, who has sided with the opposition, described the current parliament as \"illegitimate\" after allegations of fraud in last month's elections. Zourabichvili said she would retain her role as president, despite the country's newly elected parliament saying it would choose her replacement on 14 December. Mass protests in the capital are continuing to erupt for a third consecutive night on Saturday in the capital Tbilisi.\n\nRiot police have been deployed around the country's parliament, the focal point of three nights of protests. Officers again used tear gas and water cannon against protesters into the early hours of Sunday, as they tried to push people away from the parliament building. Demonstrations were also taking place in the cities of Batumi, Kutaisi, Zugdidi, and other Georgian regions. \"I'm offering this stability for the transition, because what these people on the streets are demanding is a call for new elections in order to restore this country and its European path,\" said Zourabichvili. Hundreds of civil servants have signed letters expressing their disapproval of the government's decision to put negotiations with the EU on hold, saying it went against the national interests of Georgia.

The party claimed victory in last month's election but opposition MPs are boycotting the new parliament, alleging fraud. On Thursday, the European Parliament backed a resolution, external, describing the election as the latest stage in Georgia's \"worsening democratic crisis\" and saying that the ruling party was \"fully responsible\". It expressed particular concern about reports of voter intimidation, vote-buying and manipulation, and harassment of observers. Following the resolution, Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said his government had \"decided not to bring up the issue of joining the European Union on the agenda until the end of 2028\". In response, thousands of pro-EU protesters started demonstrating outside Georgian Dream offices in the cities of Tbilisi and Kutaisi on Thursday. A group of public figures, writers and journalists have also been protesting outside the country's public broadcaster in the capital Tbilisi, accusing it of being a mouthpiece for the country's ruling party. “The public broadcaster must be freed from the influence of the Russians and the pressure of the regime,” said writer and activist Lasha Bugadze. “The public broadcaster covers the whole of Georgia and they are brainwashing our population with propaganda, people who may not be sure what is going on,” he said.\n\nFour opposition coalitions and parties that won seats in last month's parliamentary elections but refused to take up their mandates citing widespread vote rigging have issued a joint statement, calling for fresh elections under international supervision. “Parties with a legitimate mandate of the Georgian people will confront the illegitimate regime of Georgian Dream and the systemic violence against peaceful demonstrators and journalists,” read the statement.

A jury in San Francisco found him not guilty on all counts in a stunning victory for Mr Lynch, who had been accused of inflating the value of Autonomy, his company, ahead of its sale. Mr Lynch, who faced more than 20 years in prison if convicted, had denied the charges and took the stand to defend himself. In his testimony, he maintained he had focused on technology not accounting, distancing himself from other executives, including the company's former chief financial officer who was already successfully prosecuted for fraud.\n\n\"I am elated with today’s verdict and grateful to the jury for their attention to the facts over the last 10 weeks,\" Mr Lynch said in a statement. \"I am looking forward to returning to the UK and getting back to what I love most: my family and innovating in my field.\" University of Cambridge graduate Mr Lynch co-founded Autonomy in 1996 out of a specialist software research group called Cambridge Neurodynamics.

The company, known for software that could extract useful information from \"unstructured\" sources such as phone calls, emails or video, was ultimately sold to Hewlett-Packard (HP) in 2011 in a deal that ranked as the largest-ever takeover of a British technology business at the time. Mr Lynch made £500m from the sale. Just a year later, HP wrote down the value of Autonomy by $8.8bn. The company's chief financial officer, Sushovan Hussain, was found guilty of fraud in 2018 and later sentenced to five years in prison. US prosecutors brought charges against Mr Lynch in 2018, accusing him of inflating the value of the firm using backdated agreements to mislead about the company's sales; concealing the firm's loss-making business reselling hardware and intimidating or paying off people who raised concerns. Mr Lynch, who lives in Suffolk, was eventually extradited after a UK judge ruled in favour of HP in a similar civil fraud case in 2022. HP is seeking a reported $4bn in that case. Mr Lynch, a former UK government adviser who sat on the boards of the BBC and the British Library, had faced house arrest in the US while preparing for the trial which began in San Francisco in March. Prosecutors had called dozens of witnesses to the stand, including the former head of HP Leo Apotheker, who was fired shortly after the purchase was announced. But the arguments fell flat. Mr Lynch's team pushed the argument that HP had failed to properly vet the deal and mismanaged the takeover, while he testified he was uninvolved with the transactions being described. Judge Charles Breyer had already dismissed one count of securities fraud during the trial for lack of evidence. Abraham Simmons, a spokesman for the US Attorney's Office, said: \"We acknowledge and respect the verdict. \"We would like to thank the jury for its attentiveness to the evidence the government presented in this case.\" As well as Mr Lynch, another former finance executive at Autonomy, Stephen Chamberlain, was also on trial. He was found not guilty. Lawyers for Mr Lynch, Christopher Morvillo and Brian Heberlig, said in a statement that they were thrilled by the outcome, saying it reflected a \"rejection of the government's profound overreach in this case\". \"This verdict closes the book on a relentless 13-year effort to pin HP's well-documented ineptitude on Dr Lynch,\" they said. \"Thankfully, the truth has finally prevailed.\""}

Isr", "continuation": "ael’s military said it had “conducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound” in the school and killed many of the 20 to 30 fighters it believed were inside. Gaza’s Hamas-run Government Media Office denied the claim and accused Israel of carrying out a “horrific massacre”. The US has called on Israel to be \"fully transparent\" in making information about the strike public. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), which runs the school, described the incident as \"horrific\" and said the claim that armed groups might have been inside a shelter was \"shocking\" but could not be confirmed. Dead and wounded people were rushed to the al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Hospital, in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah, which has been overwhelmed since the Israeli military began a new ground operation against Hamas in central Gaza this week.\n\nThe BBC is working to verify the reports about the strike in Nuseirat camp. Local journalists and residents said it took place in the early hours of Thursday at al-Sardi school, which is in a south-eastern area of the densely-populated, decades-old camp, where Unrwa provides services. Unrwa said 6,000 displaced people were sheltering in the school complex at the time. Many schools and other UN facilities have been used as shelters by the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes during the war, which has lasted almost eight months. Videos shared on social media showed the destruction of several classrooms in one of the school's buildings, as well as bodies wrapped in white shrouds and blankets. “I was asleep when the incident occurred. Suddenly, we heard a loud explosion and shattered glass and debris from the building fell on us,” Udai Abu Elias, a man who was living at the school, told BBC Arabic's Gaza Today programme. “Smoke filled the air, and I couldn't see anything. I didn't expect to make it out alive. I heard someone calling for survivors to come out from under the rubble. I struggled to see as I stumbled over the bodies of the martyrs.” He added: “The situation has become extremely difficult, especially for children and the elderly. Everyone is a target. The blood of the martyrs has not yet dried; it stains the stairs, walls, and bedding.\" Another man, Jabr, said he “woke up to the sight of bodies and [human] remains everywhere”, while a third who asked not to be named said the casualties included \"elderly people, young individuals, and children\".\n\nResidents initially said that more than 20 people were killed in the attack. Later, an official at al-Aqsa hospital told a freelance journalist working for the BBC that it had received 40 bodies from the school. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said 40 people were killed, including 14 children and nine women, and 74 others were injured. The same death toll was given by the director of the Hamas-run Government Media Office, Ismail al-Thawabta. Unwa's commissioner general, Philippe Lazzarini, said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that at least 35 people were killed and many more injured. The agency’s director of communications, Juliette Touma, told the BBC that \"the figures are coming from our own Unrwa colleagues on the ground\". The BBC has been reviewing videos and has not yet seen conclusive evidence of civilian casualties at the scene of the strike. However, there is footage showing child casualties at al-Aqsa hospital. US State Department spokesperson Matt Miller urged Israel to be transparent over the strike. \"\"The government of Israel has said that they are going to release more information about this strike, including the names of those who died in it. We expect them to be fully transparent in making that information public,\" he said. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said jets had conducted a \"precise strike on a Hamas compound embedded inside\" the school. An annotated aerial photograph highlighted classrooms on two upper floors of the building, which the IDF said were the “locations of the terrorists”. The IDF said members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad who took part in the 7 October attack on southern Israel, when around 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage, had been operating in the building. “Before the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information,” it added.\n\nLater, IDF spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner told reporters that between 20 and 30 fighters had been using the school to plan and carry out attacks, and that many of them were killed in the strike. \"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he added. He also said the IDF had called off the attack twice in order to limit civilian casualties and accused Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad of deliberately using UN facilities as operational bases. Mr Thawabta rejected the IDF’s claims, saying: “The occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people.” Mr Lazzarini said the school was hit “without prior warning” to his agency or the people sheltering there. “Claims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking. We are however unable to verify these claims,” he added. “Attacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of international humanitarian law. UN staff, premises and operations must be protected at all times.” Mr Lazzarini complained that more than 180 Unrwa buildings had been hit since the war began despite their co-ordinates being shared with parties to the conflict, and that more than 450 displaced people had been killed as a result. At least 36,650 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a military campaign in response to the 7 October attack, according to the territory's health ministry, whose figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants. Medics also told AFP and Palestinian news agency Wafa that another pre-dawn strike on Thursday killed six people at a house in Nuseirat camp. The IDF meanwhile said troops had located underground tunnel shafts and weapons in eastern areas of Bureij refugee camp - just west of Nuseirat - and eastern Deir al-Balah, a day after it said they had taken \"operational control\" there. Residents reported intense bombardment in the areas on Wednesday, while Médecins Sans Frontières said at least 70 bodies - the majority women and children - had been brought to al-Aqsa hospital over the previous 24 hours. The IDF also said on Thursday that troops and aircraft had killed three suspects who had approached the Gaza-Israel border fence in the Rafah area, and that an Israeli soldier had been killed in battle in southern Gaza.\n\nUN schools across Gaza have been used as shelters for displaced people throughout the war\n\nLast month, there was global outrage after an Israeli air strike, which the IDF said targeted two senior Hamas officials, and a resulting fire reportedly killed dozens of Palestinians at a tented camp for displaced people near a Unrwa logistics base in the southern city of Rafah. The IDF said the loss of life was “tragic” and that it was investigating the possibility that ammunition stored by Hamas could have caused a secondary explosion. That incident prompted mediators to revive their efforts to broker a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. US President Joe Biden outlined what he described as an Israeli proposal that had been presented to Hamas. The first phase of the plan would last six weeks and include a temporary truce that would see the release of some of the hostages still being held in Gaza in return for Palestinians from Israeli jails. The second phase would include a permanent cessation of hostilities. On Thursday, the US, UK and 16 other countries with citizens among the hostages issued a joint statement calling on the leaders of Israel and Hamas “to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal and bring relief to the families of our hostages”. Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh said on Wednesday that the group would deal \"seriously and positively\" with a proposal based on an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted he will not agree to a permanent ceasefire before Hamas is defeated and the hostages are released. On Wednesday, he declared the country was “striving for total victory”."}

{"context": "Dominique Pelicot's double life: Who is the man who plotted his wife's mass rape?\n\nDominique Pelicot - captured in photos and a court sketch - has been sentenced to 20 years in prison\n\nIt was something in Dominique Pelicot's swagger, his \"élan\" - as the French might put it - that immediately struck the psychiatrist as odd. There he stood. A 68-year-old pensioner who had already spent several months inside one of France's most notorious prisons, Les Baumettes in Marseilles. The prison was a grim, intimidating place, crowded with members of the port city's warring drug gangs. And yet the man in the visiting room who rose to greet Dr Laurent Layet on a cold day in February 2021 seemed \"clean, polished… He had just cut his own hair. He came towards me with this assertive attitude.\" Dr Layet was surprised, to put it mildly. The psychiatrist was the first of many people to scrutinise Dominique Pelicot. Each expert was looking for clues to explain how this apparently genial pensioner could have committed such grotesque crimes and deceived his unsuspecting victim for so long. In all his years interviewing hundreds of rapists and suspected rapists on behalf of French police and prosecutors, Dr Layet had never come across anyone quite like this grey-haired former electrician, calmly awaiting prosecution for drugging his wife Gisele and inviting dozens of strangers to rape her as she lay, unconscious, in the couple's bedroom. \"Something didn't fit. I had never encountered such an exceptional case,\" Dr Layet remembers thinking at the time.\n\nPsychiatrist Laurent Layet was struck by Pelicot's assertive attitude in prison\n\nAt the end of a gruelling, four-month trial that has enraged people across France and far beyond - even as they were inspired by the dignity and courage of Gisele - Dominique Pelicot's confident demeanour, a grandiose presence in the courtroom in Avignon, remained intact. One might expect a man in Pelicot's position - a globally reviled sexual predator, and rapist, facing the near-certain prospect of dying in prison - to cut a wretched figure. And there have been a handful of brief moments when he wept, openly, in court - usually for himself. But for the most part, he struck an imperious pose, courtroom microphone in one hand, his body slouched in a throne-like chair (to accommodate the accused's health issues), sometimes looking bored, occasionally interjecting like a ringmaster seeking to keep an unruly circus - the 50 other men on trial beside him - in their place.\n\nThe shocking story of Gisele Pelicot, raped by strangers her husband invited to abuse her.\n\n\"I am a rapist, like the others in this room. They knew everything,\" he intoned, speaking with the confidence of a man who assumed his words would put an end to all further discussion. But what are we to make of that domineering performance? And what have we really learned of this jowly, grey-haired figure, with his black cane and scarf, seated in a glass cage; this serial rapist whose cruelty has almost been eclipsed in the public imagination by the dignity and courage shown by his former wife? Dr Layet first encountered Dominique in the late summer of 2020 at a police station in the nearby town of Carpentras, immediately after his arrest for filming with a camera up women's skirts in a local supermarket. Called in to assess Pelicot, Dr Layet noted how breezily he dismissed his crime, like a genteel grandfather caught pocketing a few cigarettes. Dr Layet detected a \"dissonance\" in the man's behaviour, and the strong implication that he was hiding something more serious. He told the police that this one was worth closer inspection.\n\nIn court, years later, after two long prison interviews with Pelicot and with more than 20 of the other accused, Dr Layet presented a more detailed assessment to the panel of judges. A measured and eloquent expert witness, Dr Layet stressed that Pelicot exhibited no signs of severe mental illness. He could not be dismissed as a \"monster\". Nor was he psychotic - unable to tell reality from fiction. And yet. There was a \"fissure\", a split, in Pelicot's personality. A showier witness might have borrowed from popular culture to compare him to a tormented Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, or perhaps to Hannibal Lecter, stiff-backed in his prison cell in The Silence of the Lambs. \"Almost like a hard drive,\" he suggested. A fitting metaphor, given that Pelicot had stored video evidence of his crimes on a computer memory card.\n\nLater, in an interview with the BBC at his office in Carpentras, Dr Layet explained that Pelicot's mind had become divided, over time, like a partitioned computer disk, into two entirely separate \"water-tight parts… with no leakage between them. His split personality is very effective and very solid. We either have the 'normal Mr Pelicot' or the other Mr Pelicot at night, in the bedroom.\" Asked in court to explain that \"other\" Pelicot, Dr Layet said that he had detected a range of emotional and sexual abnormalities. They are, perhaps, most neatly captured in their original French, in a prosecution document seen by the BBC: \"Egomania, narcissistic fragility, emotional disorders... an abnormal sexual deviancy combining candaulism [exposing your female partner to others for sexual enjoyment], voyeurism and somnophilia.\" Pelicot's own defence lawyer, Beatrice Zavarro, enthusiastically embraced the \"split\" personality theory in her closing arguments at the trial. She suggested that the charming young man Gisele Pelicot had fallen in love with and quickly married back in 1973 \"was not the man that had harmed her\".\n\nGisele Pelicot was surrounded by well-wishers outside court\n\nBut that is not what Dr Layet - or the other psychiatrists we have consulted for this article - meant. There may be two sides to Pelicot's behaviour, but there is - to stick with Dr Layet's computing metaphor - only one operating system that controls his cruel, private urges and his public demeanour. A simpler way of putting it is that Pelicot has an antisocial personality disorder - a term preferred by psychiatrists these days to words such as psychopath or sociopath. Several experts have concluded it is a reasonable diagnosis to use in the context of Pelicot's warped mind. He is not \"mad\" - he cannot claim diminished responsibility for his actions. But he does show well-established traits of a personality disorder characterised by a lack of empathy towards other humans. Those traits may have been sharpened by the sexual abuse he experienced as a child. Which brings us to another key question. Did Pelicot only become a rapist in retirement, or was he preying on women long before he began drugging his wife? Sitting towards the back of the courtroom one Tuesday afternoon late in the trial, surrounded by journalists tapping away on their laptops, Florence Rault looked at Dominique Pelicot with a particularly well-informed sense of disgust. \"It can be assumed that what happened in Mazan… is only the culmination of a long process,\" she said later, in a BBC interview. Ms Rault, a lawyer specialising in criminal cases, knew something deeply troubling about Pelicot - allegations of appalling crimes arguably more disturbing than those for which he was about to be convicted. For many years, she had been fighting for justice for two women who were the victims of violent ordeals in the 1990s.\n\nMore than 20 years before the rapes for which he has now been sentenced - in 1999 - Pelicot is accused of assaulting and attempting to rape a 23-year-old estate agent, known by the pseudonym Marion, in the suburbs of Paris. She fought the attacker off. He eventually admitted to being present at the scene in 2021 after DNA - a spot of blood on the victim's shoe - was finally found to match Pelicot's. But he continues to deny he attempted to rape her and the investigation continues. \"Once he was told that his DNA was found at the crime scene, he said 'Yes, it's me,'\" Ms Rault remembered. And that discovery quickly led to a link to an even older cold case. In 1991, another young estate agent, Sophie Narme, had been raped and murdered. Although crucial DNA evidence had gone missing, the similarities between the scenes were so striking that Pelicot is under investigation for the crime, which he denies. The search for other potential links to older crimes is also ongoing.\n\nIf you've been affected by issues of sexual abuse, information and support is available at BBC Action Line.\n\nMs Rault is not expecting any more confessions from Pelicot in relation to the cold cases. \"Until he's confronted with indisputable proof, he will deny [everything],\" said Ms Rault, who once sat beside Pelicot at a hearing and was struck, like Dr Layet, by his \"relaxed, rather serene\" demeanour. Ms Rault now watched him in the Avignon courtroom and saw the same behaviour. She also noted how Pelicot emphatically and tearfully denied drugging and raping his own daughter, Caroline, despite having taken deeply troubling photos of her, asleep, and without her knowledge. \"She's convinced that he sexually abused her too. ", "continuation": "But since we don't have any formal evidence like DNA to put in front of him, of course he will continue to deny it,\" said Rault, arguing that, for Caroline, the agony of uncertainty was as cruel and traumatic as the suffering of a victim who knew exactly what had happened to her.\n\nPelicot is also being investigated for the rape and murder of Sophie Narme in 1991\n\nPelicot's attitude towards his family in court was often revealing. The psychiatrist, Dr Layet, pointed out that the accused narcissistically focused on the love his wife and children once felt for him, not his betrayal of their trust. For Pelicot, this \"started out as a love story\" and he \"doesn't want this to be ignored\", said Dr Layet. But Ms Rault had come to court to look for other signs. Above all, she wanted to shore up her sense that Pelicot's crimes were highly premeditated. \"Serial rapists… usually have an impulse. They commit rape. They leave, and then they forget. This is not the case with [Pelicot] at all,\" she said. Ms Rault recalled the methodical actions of Marion's attacker inside an estate agent's office in 1999. The way he had made an excuse to return to his car - almost certainly to collect a rope and a bottle of ether to drug her. Then Ms Rault noted that the man in the glass cage in Avignon demonstrated a similar self-possession and saw it as further evidence that this was a deeply calculating criminal. \"When he says he has urges and acts on impulse, it's nothing like that. He is very calm.\" On the same day that Ms Rault was in the Avignon courtroom, I was sitting nearby. Gisele Pelicot was a few metres to our right. Dozens of the accused sat in front of us. Dominique Pelicot was over to the left side of the room. During a break in proceedings, I walked over to him. According to French law, journalists are not allowed to talk to the accused. Instead, I stood for a while and watched him as he sat in his chair, behind his glass wall, one hand on his stick. Then his head turned towards me, and he held my gaze for what must have been 20 seconds - although it felt much longer. His expression did not change. He did not seem to blink. And then, like a bored man switching between equally boring television channels, he looked away."}

One victory in nine. \"We'll be coming, Munich\", as the song doesn't go. Craig Gordon's Hollywood exit turned into one of those B-movie horrors. Brought on to great acclaim after 69 minutes for his 75th - and presumably last - cap, given Gordon has been cut from Clarke’s Euros squad, this was a moment of pure sentimentality. You could have asked why? You could have pointed out that with one week to go before opening the Euros against Germany in Munich that this was not the night for Clarke to get emotional on us. In the circumstances - two goals to the good and cruising - the urge, instead, was to ask why not? The game was effectively won. The coast was more or less clear for Gordon’s story to unfold. Hampden was in a happy place.\n\nBesides, as Clarke explained afterwards, he did not want to be the man who denied the goalkeeper his milestone appearance as well as a place in Germany. Gordon, at 41 years and 159 days, is the oldest Scotland men's international of them all. His career has been built on the back of class and resilience, an almost superhuman power to recover from the kind of injuries that experts told him he had little chance of recovering from. His is a controversial omission but this was a consolation prize, a chance to say farewell in front of his own people. Given the captain's armband, it was a strange way to say goodbye, but hey, a lovely cameo nonetheless. Until it wasn't. Gordon was on the pitch for three minutes when Finland made it 2-1. He was on the pitch for 15 minutes when he gave away the penalty that made it 2-2. He was shown a yellow card, shook his head at the decisions that crashed around his ears and was then beaten from the spot. Romance be damned.\n\nScotland cornered the global market in pre-tournament farewells in the magnificent if somewhat misplaced optimism of 1978, but for half the night at Hampden this was a party at the other end of the spectrum. It was quiet and it was flat. Scotland had created nothing. Lawrence Shankland, the deadliest striker in the Scottish Premiership, looked like a lost lamb. John McGinn, one of the team's most prolific contributors, was hushed and diminished, his ample bottom somehow bonier now. The glorious goodbye that Clarke was looking for was not materialising, the \"negative Normans\" he spoke about pre-match were multiplying in number. A turbulent preamble to Germany pockmarked by injury - still no sign of the utterly indispensable Scott McTominay - and poor form, and now a night that was supposed to sizzle and get the whole thing firing again was in danger of burning out. Scotland looked like they would be spared a limping exit from Glasgow, thanks in one part to an own goal off an Andy Robertson cross and in other part, a header from Shankland off another Robertson cross. In those moments, Hampden did not exactly shake to its very foundations but the joy and relief was palpable. After the losses to Spain, England, France, the Netherlands and Northern Ireland. and the less-than-euphoric 2-0 victory over Gibraltar - welcome back, feelgood. It has been a while.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'The conversation with Craig was particularly emotional'\n\nRyan Christie looked lively. Kieran Tierney looked like the leader Scotland needs. Anthony Ralston, with only six starts for Celtic all season, coped admirably on one of the biggest nights of his football life. At stake, a starting place against Germany next Friday. Ralston looks hot favourite for that position now. On came young Tommy Conway for his debut. On came Lewis Morgan, a bolter from the MLS. Things looked rosy, until the petals started to drop and the win went away. So, no open-top bus, no wild scenes, no predictions of impending greatness in Germany. It was a curious kind of evening, but then these are curious times. Clarke has been on edge this week and was a little touchy in his pre-match interviews when asked about the leaking of the names of the two players - Gordon and John Souttar - who he later confirmed will miss out. It has all got a bit antsy, but the trip to Germany and Scotland's retreat in the ski resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen near the Austrian border presents a chance to plot and ponder, a bit of space to reset and bring it to the Germa", "continuation": "ns in Munich. Scotland are underdogs whose bark has become worryingly soft in recent months, but in every waking minute of every day from now until Friday, Clarke and his players will be working on finding themselves. This team beat Spain and Norway not that long ago. They qualified at a relative canter. They are a better team than they have shown of late. Friday might be an opportune time to prove it.\n• None Give us your thoughts on Scotland. And if you're going to Germany, tell us how you're getting there."}
{"context": "These are shape-shifting times in the Middle East.\n\nThis week, out of the blue, Iran suddenly attacked targets in \"friendly\" Pakistan, sparking an unprecedented tit-for-tat across their volatile border and a sharp spike in tension on a far edge of the grievous Israel-Gaza war.\n\nIran wanted a message to be heard loud and clear - at home, and a long way beyond.\n\n\"It has showcased its missile arsenal and its willingness to use it,\" says Vali Nasr, professor of international affairs and Middle East studies at Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\"It was a message also likely intended for Israel and the US in the midst of the Gaza ", "continuation": "war, especially with the potential escalation in Lebanon and Yemen.\"\n\nLike most observers, he believes \"for now Iran is not looking to escalate\".\n\nEver since the Gaza war exploded after Hamas's murderous 7 October assault on southern Israel, it has been darkened by fears of an even more dangerous contagion. No-one, including Iran and its principal partner Hezbollah, as well as the United States, wants to see an even hotter conflagration.\n\nIran's war has been a web of shadow wars. It sits at the fulcrum of what it calls an \"axis of resistance\", the alliance of Tehran-backed groups dotting the region, from Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, to the Houthis in Yemen, and well-armed groups in both Iraq and Syria. Most have been designated as terrorist entities by some Western states.\n\nTheir military prowess is rooted in Iran's accelerated arming and training; each actor also has agendas and ambitions of its own.\n\nFires have been burning on all these fronts, and sometimes blazing, with efforts to douse the flames lest they provoke crippling Israeli and American reprisals.\n\nWhen Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) carried out these first direct strikes since this crisis erupted, they trained their sights on Pakistan and two other friendly countries. They may have seen them as areas of least resistance beyond the highly combustible landscape of their \"axis of resistance\".\n\nIran's elite force unleashed a barrage of ballistic missiles and suicide drones against what it called an intelligence centre for Israel's Mossad spy agency in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq, and at \"anti-Iran terror groups\" including Islamic State in rebel-controlled swathes of Syria.\n\nEach operation was said to have its own specific retaliatory rationale.\n\nIran says it had to aim fire at Iranian Baloch separatists operating in restive southwest Pakistan.\n\n\"An attack was imminent. They had gathered and were leaving the base,\" says Prof Seyed Mohammad Marandi at the University of Tehran. He also points to last month's killing of 11 Iranian police officers in its tense province of Sistan and Balochistan.\n\nPakistan also spoke of an \"impending attack\" when it then fired its own salvos two days later into southern Iran against what it said were bases of its own Baloch nationalists, which it called \"terrorist targets\". This cross-border tension has simmered for decades; this is its worst moment.\n\nNorthern Iraq and Syria, closer to the Gaza epicentre, were about settling separate scores.\n\n\"The attacks in Iraq and Syria were retaliation for the general as well as the atrocity in Kerman,\" explains Prof Marandi. He's referring to last month's assassination just outside Damascus of one of the IRGC's most senior men, Sayyed Razi Mousavi, which was widely reported as the work of an Israeli air strike.\n\nThen, earlier this month, a double suicide bombing shattered a memorial service in Iran for Qasem Soleimani, the top commander assassinated by an American drone in Iraq four years ago. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the deadliest attack in Iran since the 1979 revolution.\n\n\"Iran has been under pressure to react, including to the killing of senior Hamas and Hezbollah commanders in Lebanon, but it doesn't want to get directly embroiled in any escalation by hitting Israel or the US,\" says Mohammad Ali Shabani, editor of Amwaj media, which provides in-depth analyses of the region.\n\n\"We are going to continue to see a slow boil,\" he says.\n\nThese are also tough times at home for Iran's ruling clerics. They've faced unprecedented women-led protests over social freedoms and more, as well as financial woes stemming from international sanctions, alleged corruption, and mismanagement.\n\nAnd there has been blowback after these latest operations, with angry denunciations from Iraq, as well as the Arab League, and an even more forceful rebuke from Pakistan.\n\n\"They did not think through that striking in Pakistan territory could just have no repercussions,\" remarks former Pakistan foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar. \"Their action created a crater of distrust. It will take hard work and persistence to fill.\"\n\nThere are wars within wars in every corner of this conflict. Pakistan also had to be seen to be setting its own red lines in a neighbourhood where age-old rival India, as well as Taliban-run Afghanistan, were watching closely. Accusations and more of harbouring hostile forces have long been hurled across those borders too.\n\nThis past week has been a reminder, if one was needed, of the unpredictability and peril in this moment of a widening and worsening Israel-Gaza war.\n\nAny day can be a flare-up on one or multiple fronts - and there are the longer-term risks being shaped in a region where fault lines were deeply and darkly etched long before Hamas's 7 October attacks.\n\nIsrael's largest loss of life in a single day since the founding of its state, as well as the seizing of more than 250 hostages, sparked a military campaign causing a staggering number of civilian deaths and turning much of Gaza into an unliveable wasteland.\n\nIt has enraged and emboldened this Iran-backed military alliance of militant non-state actors. They've been drawing closer for years. Now they've forged a far more vocal and visible league.\n\nFor Iran's adversaries, the proverbial \"we need to do something about Iran\" may now be even riskier. It may also mean confronting Tehran's staunchest allies across the region.\n\n\"Tehran has achieved what the Pentagon calls military 'overmatch' - a level of capability in which a country has weaponry that makes it extremely difficult to check or defeat,\" says Robin Wright, author of several books on Iran and a distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars.\n\nThis current escalation has not been cost-free. US salvos against Iranian-backed fighters in Iraq are reported to have significantly damaged their infrastructure.\n\nThe Pentagon says its air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, in an effort to stop their attacks on vessels in the vital Red Sea shipping lanes, have destroyed a quarter of the Houthi arsenal.\n\nBut on the balance sheets of some of Iran's allies, they believe they're winning far more than they're losing. Standing up for Gazans has galvanised their popularity on Arab streets. Yemen's Houthis in particular are relishing being catapulted into the centre of world attention.\n\nMinds are already focused on the \"day after\", when this Israel-Gaza war ends, including in Tehran, which has long prided itself on its \"strategic patience\".\n\n\"Iran is playing a broader longer game,\" points out Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House. \"It perhaps anticipates that after Gaza winds down Israel is going to be more provocative towards Iran, so it is preparing for a longer fight.\"\n\nIran's long-term goals include keeping the US out of its backyard, and avoiding a direct confrontation with Israel and America.\n\nThat means careful calculations on where and how it strikes in a hazardous region where the risks of miscalculation are always dangerously high."}

The White House says the new order \"will be in effect when high levels of encounters at the southern border exceed our ability to deliver timely consequences, as is the case today.\" The restrictions will come into force when the seven-day average for daily crossings hits 2,500 - when the border is \"overwhelmed\", as the White House describes it. \"They will make it easier for immigration officers to quickly remove individuals who do not have a legal basis to remain,\" officials explained. The border will reopen to asylum seekers only when the average figure holds at 1,500 over a seven-day period - and it will then reopen to migrants two weeks later. Other measures are aimed at quickly resolving immigration cases in court, and expedited removals for those found to have no legal basis to remain in the US. Asylum processing at ports of entry will continue under the order. About 1,500 asylum seekers go through the process at official crossings each day, mostly after setting up appointments using a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) app known as CBP One.\n\nAmong the actions announced were the use of a 1952 law that allows access to the asylum system to be restricted. The law, known as 212(f), allows a president to \"suspend the entry\" of foreigners if their arrival is \"detrimental to the interests\" of the country. The same regulation was used by the Trump administration to ban immigration and travel from several predominantly Muslim countries and to bar migrants from asylum if they were apprehended crossing into the US illegally, provoking accusations of racism. \"It’s unfortunate that politics are driving the immigration conversation in an increasingly restrictive direction,\" commented Jennie Murray, president and the CEO of the National Immigration Forum. Guerline Jozef, executive director of Haitian Bridge Alliance - which works with Haitian migrants at the border - called the announcement \"a direct assault on the fundamental human right to seek asylum\". A spokeswoman for the UN's refugee agency insisted that people fearing persecution must have access to safe territory.\n\nThe issue of migration has become a headache for Mr Biden in an election year. Trump has vowed to carry out the \"largest deportation operation\" in American history to remove undocumented migrants already if he is re-elected. Biden administration officials have resisted comparisons with policies from Trump's presidency, saying the new rules touted on Tuesday would only apply during periods of increased arrivals. They said exemptions would be made for unaccompanied children and those being trafficked. The Biden administration plans to defend the new policies in court from any legal challenges it could face - a risk that was highlighted by Ms Jayapal. Mexican media have depicted the move as one of Mr Biden's toughest policies, though President Andrés Manuel López Obrador sought to downplay the issue, arguing that economic and cultural exchange made a border closure \"impossible\". Authorities in Tijuana asked what would happen to asylum seekers denied entry to the US. Shelters in the Mexican city could quickly get overcrowded, one local official warned. \"We’d start seeing people on the streets, sleeping in tents”."}

The massively multiplayer online (MMO) sci-fi shooter is set in a futuristic universe where humanity, overseen by a mysterious sphere known as The Traveler, fights for survival against enemy entity The Darkness. First launched by Halo developer Bungie in 2014, it released to mixed reviews but impressive sales. Since then it's had a rocky road, but a decade down the line Destiny has built a dedicated community of fans and had a big influence on online gaming, particularly with its loot system of item-gathering that encourages repeat plays. New expansion The Final Shape is the beginning of the end of a story that's been building since the original launch. It's a big moment for fans, and an important chance for Bungie to prove it can still bring the goods.\n\nThe Final Shape brings Destiny's Light and Dark saga to a conclusion\n\nAs you'd imagine, over ten years a long-running, complex storyline and huge well of lore has built up around the game. To give you some idea of how deep it goes, YouTuber My name is byf released a 10-hour recap video , externalthis week covering the whole arc, known as the Light and Dark Saga. The Final Shape is billed as the end of this era, and will lead to a climactic showdown between Guardians - player characters - and main bad guy The Witness. Destiny streamer Henry, better known to his 400,000 Twitch, external followers as IFrostBolt, tells BBC Newsbeat why this has got fans of the game excited. \"This story has been going on for so many years, and we've been waiting to get multiple answers,\" he says. \"What is The Traveler? What is our purpose in this universe that Bungie has created? \"We have so many questions, and we're hoping that this expansion is going to give us all the answers that we want.\"\n\nThe hype around The Final Shape means there's pressure on Bungie to stick the landing. The most recent expansion - last year's Lightfall - got a lukewarm reception all-round. According to player tracker SteamDB, external - which measures the number of users logged in on PC - numbers have dropped since Lightfall's launch last February when 312,000 people were online at one point. But they've been climbing again since March this year, and The Final Shape climbed to number two in the charts of online game store Steam this week. Bosses at Bungie and Sony, which bought the developer in 2022, will be keeping a close eye on those figures. The console-maker acquired the company as part of its plans to launch more \"live service\" games - online titles with frequent content updates designed to keep players coming back. Unconfirmed reports have suggested that Bungie, which laid off 100 staff last November, could be forced to give Sony more control if it doesn't hit certain financial targets. Neither has commented publicly. But Henry believes they can pull it off. \"Even as a player, I'm so nervous for them,\" he says. \"And I'm not the one writing the story. \"But they can definitely do good stories.\" He says Lightfall was a bit of a shock for long-time fans, but previous updates such as Destiny expansion The Taken King and Destiny 2 expansions Forsaken and The Witch Queen were among Bungie's \"best stories ever told\". \"I'm hoping that with Final Shape they are actually very focused on telling a very good story,\" says Henry. \"But yeah, the pressure is on them to deliver because there's so many questions that they haven't answered yet. \"And this is kind of their last opportunity to do so.\"\n\nHenry, aka IFrostBolt, says he's keen to know where Destiny will go next\n\nHenry s", "continuation": "ays one of the keys to Destiny's ongoing success has been the community that gets behind the game. \"So many of us have been dedicated to this game since the start,\" he says. \"And many will tell you at this point, we just want to ride it to the end and see what's gonna go down.\" Henry also thinks The Final Shape will draw back Destiny players who have strayed away to other titles, curious to see the new story beats. \"I feel like the content that we have in the game right now has shown that they're taking our feedback, and are really focused into bringing really good content, upping up the quality and just delivering what the fans have been asking for all these years,\" he says.\n\nThe other big question - even before the Final Shape has been released - is what's next for Destiny. In a recent video Luke Smith, one of the original game directors, appeared and told viewers the new expansion wasn't the end for the game. Henry says the hope from the community is that there will be further full-scale updates taking the story in a new direction. \"Is Destiny just gonna die afterwards?\" he says. \"We don't want the game to die. \"We want it to continue thriving, to continue to innovate, and just to continue to exist.\" It will be a while before we reach that point - The Final Shape's story will be told via episodes split into three parts, with a new act released each week. So Henry and the rest of the Destiny community will have to wait for the answers to some of those questions and to find out whether Bungie's managed to deliver the \"satisfying ending\" fans have been craving. But despite going in with mixed feelings, Henry says the release is going to be a \"moment of celebration\" for fans. \"Overall, I think the hype wins,\" he says. \"Because, I mean, it's content, right? We're ready to play.\"\n• None Watch a longer cut of BBC Newsbeat's interview with IFrostBolt on the BBC News YouTube channel, external.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."}

But growing up here - alongside the planet's largest land predator - means bear safety is part of everyday life.\n\nSigns - in shops and cafes - remind anyone heading outside to be \"bear aware\". My favourite reads: \"If a polar bear attacks you must fight back.\" Running away from a charging polar bear is – perhaps counterintuitively - dangerous. A bear's instinct is to chase prey and polar bears can run at 25mph (40kmph). Key advice: Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Don't walk alone at night.\n\nMany murals in Churchill depict Arctic wildlife, particularly polar bears\n\nA story of human resilience and respect for nature on the edge of the Canadian Arctic.\n\nChurchill is known as the polar bear capital of the world. Every year, the Hudson Bay - on the western edge of which the town is perched - thaws, and forces the bears on shore. As the freeze sets in in Autumn, hundreds of bears gather here, waiting. \"We have freshwater rivers flowing into the area and cold water coming in from the Arctic,\" explains Alysa McCall from Polar Bears International (PBI). \"So freeze-up happens here first. \"For polar bears, sea ice is a big dinner plate - it's access to their main prey, seals. They're probably excited for a big meal of seal blubber - they haven't been eating much all summer on land.\"\n\nThe polar bear population decline in the Western Hudson Bay has been linked to warming temperatures\n\nThere are 20 known sub-populations of polar bears across the Arctic. This is one of the most southerly and best studied. \"They're our fat, white, hairy canaries in the coal mine,\" Alysa explains. \"We had about 1,200 polar bears here in the 1980s and we've lost almost half of them.\" The decline, external is tied to the amount of time the bay is now ice-free, a period that is getting longer as the climate warms. No sea ice means no frozen seal-hunting platform.\n\n\"Bears here are now on land about a month longer than their grandparents were,\" explains Alysa. \"That puts pressure on mothers. [With less food] it's harder to stay pregnant and to sustain those babies.\" While their long-term survival is precarious, the bears draw conservation scientists and thousands of tourists to Churchill every year. We tag along with a group from PBI to search for bears on the sub-Arctic tundra - just a few miles from town. The team travels in a tundra buggy, a type of off-road bus with huge tyres.\n\nTourists and scientists use tundra buggies to view and monitor the bears safely\n\nAfter a few distant sightings, we have a heart-stopping close encounter. A young bear approaches and investigates our slow two-buggy convoy. He sidles up, sniffs one of the vehicles, then jumps up and plants two giant paws up on the side of the buggy. The bear casually slumps back down onto all fours, then looks up and gazes at me briefly. It is deeply confusing to look into the face of an animal that is simultaneously adorable and potentially deadly. \"You could see him sniffing and even licking the vehicle - using all his senses to investigate,\" says PBI's Geoff York, who has worked in the Arctic for more than three decades.\n\nBeing here in 'bear season' means Geoff and his colleagues can test new technologies to detect bears and protect people. The PBI team is currently fine-tuning a radar-based system dubbed 'bear-dar'. The experimental rig - a tall antenna with detectors scanning 360 degrees - is installed on the roof of a lodge in the middle of the tundra, near Churchill. \"It has artificial intelligence, so here we can basically teach it what a polar bear is,\" Geoff explains. \"This works 24/7, it can see at night and in poor visibility.\"\n\nPolar Bears International scientists Flavio Lehner (left) and Geoff York with BBC science correspondent Victoria Gill on board the tundra buggy\n\nPolar bear attacks are rare, but they are a risk for people who live and work in isolated Arctic environments. Earlier this year, a Canadian worker was killed by two polar bears near a remote defence station in Canada's northern Nunavut territory. Co-existing with these ice-dependent predators, when the Arctic climate is changing faster than at any time in history, creates a paradoxical challenge for Churchill: The ", "continuation": "polar bear population here faces long-term decline. But, in the short term, the bears are spending more of their year on shore, external, increasing the probability of bears and people coming into contact.\n\nThe polar bear alert team keep watch over trick-or-treaters at Halloween\n\nProtecting the community is the task of the polar bear alert team - trained rangers who patrol Churchill every day. We ride along with ranger Ian Van Nest, who is looking for a stubborn bear that he and his colleagues tried to chase away earlier that day. \"It turned around and came back [towards] Churchill. He doesn't seem interested in going away.\" For bears that are intent on hanging around town, the team can use a live trap: A tube-shaped container, baited with seal meat, with a door that the bear triggers when it climbs inside. \"Then we put them in the holding facility,\" Ian explains. Bears are held for 30 days, a period set to teach a bear that it is a negative thing to come to town looking for food, but that doesn't put the animal's health at risk. They are then moved - either on the back of a trailer or occasionally air-lifted by helicopter – and released further along the bay, away from people.\n\nCyril Fredlund, who works at Churchill's new scientific observatory, remembers the last time a person was killed by a polar bear in Churchill, in 1983. \"It was right in town,\" he says. \"The man was homeless and was in an abandoned building at night. There was a young bear in there too - it took him down with its paw, like he was a seal.\" People came to help, Cyril recalls, but they couldn't get the bear away from the man. \"It was like it was guarding its meal.\"\n\nThe polar bear alert program was set up around that time. No-one has been killed by a polar bear here since. Cyril is now a technician at the new Churchill Marine Observatory (CMO). Part of its remit is to understand exactly how this environment will respond to climate change. Under its retractable roof are two giant pools filled with water pumped in directly from the Hudson Bay.\n\nThe new Churchill Marine Observatory is studying water from the Hudson Bay in two experimental pools\n\n\"We can do all kinds of controlled experimental studies looking into changes in the Arctic,\" says Prof Feiyue Wang. One implication of a less icy Hudson Bay is a longer operating season for the port, which is currently closed for nine months of the year. A longer season during which the bay thaws and becomes open water could mean more ships coming in and out of Churchill. Studies at the observatory are setting out to improve the accuracy of the sea ice forecast. Research will also examine the risks associated with expanding the port. One of the first investigations is an experimental oil spill. Scientists plan to release oil into one of the pools, test clean-up techniques and measure how quickly the oil degrades in the cold water. For Churchill's mayor, Mike Spence, understanding how to plan for the future, particularly when it comes to shipping goods in and out of Churchill, is vital for the town's future in a warming world. \"We're already looking into extending the season,\" he says, gesturing towards the port, which has ceased operating for the winter. \"In ten years' time, this will be bustling.\"\n\nChurchill's port is currently closed down for nine months of the year when the ice sets in\n\nClimate change poses a challenge for the polar bear capital of the world, but the mayor is optimistic. \"We have a great town,\" he says, \"a wonderful community. And the summer season - [when people come to see the Beluga whales in the bay] - is growing.\" \"We're all being challenged by climate change,\" he adds. \"Does that mean you stop existing? No - you adapt. You work out how to take advantage of it.\" While Mike Spence says \"the future is bright\" for Churchill, it might not be so bright for the polar bears. Tee and her friends look out over the bay, from a window at the back of the school building. The polar bear alert team's vehicles are gathering outside, trying to move a bear away from town. \"If climate change continues,\" muses Tee's classmate Charlie, \"the polar bears might just stop coming here.\" The teacher approaches to make sure the children have someone coming to pick them up - that they're not walking home alone.

Sara's father and stepmother were found guilty of her murder on Wednesday, in a case Sir Keir described as \"awful\". It comes as the government said it would introduce a new duty so that parents need local authority consent to home-school children if the child is subject to a protection plan. Speaking earlier, Dame Rachel de Souza, the Children's Commissioner for England, said it was \"madness\" that the law currently allows parents to take a child out of school, even if concerns had already been raised.\n\nThe new proposals would include a child identifier, to act like an NHS number, with a requirement for every council to have multi-agency child safeguarding teams. \"We clearly need answers as to how this could have happened. We're focused on doing everything within our power to stop this type of terrible crime happening again,\" a No 10 spokesperson said. Sara was removed from school after her father and stepmother became aware her teachers had spoken to social services. Urfan Sharif, 43, and Beinash Batool, 30, were convicted of Sara's murder on Wednesday after a trial heard they had subjected her to two years of horrific abuse.\n\nSurrey County Council, which was told of concerns for Sara's welfare, has launched an independent review into its handling of the case. Meanwhile, the government is planning a Children's Wellbeing Bill that it says will make \"changes to ensure children are safe, healthy, happy and treated fairly\". Asked whether the government would ban smacking children in the bill, Starmer said: \"Obviously there are going to be questions that need to be answered in relation to this case. \"I don't think that we should allow ourselves to think that whatever the rules on smacking are that's got anything to do with this case. \"This is about violence. It's about abuse. It's about making sure that [there are] protecting safeguards for children, particularly those being home-schooled. So that's where I think the questions are.\"\n\nWarning: This article contains descriptions of physical abuse Sara's body was found with dozens of injuries - including burns and probable human bite marks - at the family's home in Woking, Surrey, in the early hours of 10 August last year. She had been killed two days before, prompting Sharif and the rest of the family to flee to Pakistan. Around an hour after landing, Sharif called police in England and told the operator that he had killed Sara. In the months before Sara's death, teachers at her school raised concerns with Surrey County Council's social services about bruises on her body. An investigation was opened but closed again six days later, and after becoming aware of the referral Sharif and Batool took Sara out of school altogether. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Dame Rachel said they should never have been allowed to do so. \"If a child is [the] suspected [victim] of abuse, they cannot be educated at home,\" she said. \"Being in school is a safeguard. They are safer under the eyes of teachers. \"We cannot let a child who is at risk... at home go and be educated at home. It's madness.\"\n\nAbout 111,700 children were in home education in England on census day in autumn 2024, according to government data. Dame Rachel said the bill should introduce a register of all children being educated at home, which does not currently exist. She added that there should be greater data sharing between health and education services as well as between different areas of the country to make sure children at risk can be identified. She also called for an end to an exemption in assault laws that allows for the \"reasonable chastisement\" of children.

Known for its silver sand and clear blue waters, the Radhanagar beach there had recently been crowned \"Asia's Best Beach\" by Time magazine. My best friend from college and her family had lived in Port Blair, the capital of the archipelago, for a decade and a half, but this was my first visit to the islands, where I had arrived on Christmas Eve. We had planned to spend three days in Havelock and in the morning we packed snacks and sandwiches, gathered excited children and headed out to catch the ferry from Phoenix Bay jetty in Port Blair. Not wanting to miss out on anything, I was standing on the front deck, looking around, when disaster struck. Just as we pulled out from the harbour, the boat lurched and suddenly the jetty next to where we had boarded crumpled and fell into the sea. It was followed by the watchtower and an electricity pole.

At the time I didn't know, but the 9.1 magnitude quake was the third most powerful, external ever recorded in the world - and remains the biggest and most destructive in Asia. Occurring off the coast of northwest Sumatra under the Indian Ocean, it unleashed a devastating tsunami that killed an estimated 228,000 people across more than a dozen countries and caused massive damage in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Maldives and Thailand. The Andaman and Nicobar islands, located just about 100km north of the epicentre, suffered extensive damage when a wall of water, as high as 15 metres (49 ft) in places, hit land just about 15 minutes later. The official death toll was put at 1,310 – but with more than 5,600 people missing and presumed dead, it's believed that more than 7,000 islanders perished. While on the boat, however, we were oblivious to the scale of destruction around us. Our mobile phones didn't work on the water and we only got snippets of information from the crew.

This made the passengers – most of them tourists looking forward to sun and sand – anxious.\n\nAfter several hours of bobbing along in rough seas, we returned to Port Blair. Because Phoenix Bay had been closed following the morning's damage, we were taken to Chatham, another harbour in Port Blair. The jetty where we were dropped had huge, gaping holes in places. The signs of devastation were all around us as we headed home – buildings had turned into rubble, small upturned boats sat in the middle of the streets and roads had great gashes in them. Thousands of people had been turned homeless when the tidal wave flooded their homes in low-lying areas. I met a traumatised nine-year-old girl whose house was filled with water and she told me she had nearly drowned. A woman told me she had lost her entire life's possessions in the blink of an eye.\n\nIn Port Blair, buildings had turned into rubble, small upturned boats sat in the middle of the streets and roads had huge gashes\n\nOver the next three weeks, I reported extensively on the disaster and its effects on the population. It was the first time a tsunami had wreaked such havoc in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the scale of the tragedy was overwhelming. Salt water contaminated many sources of fresh water and destroyed large tracts of arable land. Getting vital supplies into the islands was tough with jetties unserviceable. The authorities mounted a huge relief and rescue effort. The army, navy and air force were deployed, but it took days before they could get to all the islands. Every day, navy and coast guard ships brought boatloads of people made homeless by the tsunami from other islands to Port Blair where schools and government buildings were turned into temporary shelters. They brought stories of devastation in their homelands. Many told me they had escaped with nothing but the clothes on their backs. One woman from Car Nicobar told me that when the earthquake struck, the ground started to spew foamy water at the same time as the waves came in from the sea. She and hundreds of others from her village had waited for rescuers without food or water for 48 hours. She said it was a \"miracle\" that she and her 20-day-old baby had survived. Port Blair was almost daily jolted by aftershocks, some of them strong enough to start rumours of fresh tsunamis, making scared people run to get to higher ground.\n\nA few days later, the Indian military flew journalists to Car Nicobar, a flat fertile island known for its enchanting beaches and also home to a large Indian air force colony. The killer tsunami had completely flattened the base. The water rose by 12 metres here and as most people slept, the ground was pulled away from under their feet. A hundred people died here. More than half were air force officers and their families. We visited Malacca and Kaakan villages on the island which also bore the brunt of nature's fury, forcing residents to take shelter in tents along the road. Among them were families torn apart by the tidal wave. A grief-stricken young couple told me they had managed to save their five-month-old baby, but their other children, aged seven and 12, were washed away. Surrounded by coconut palms on all sides, every house had turned into rubble. Among the personal belongings strewn about were clothes, textbooks, a child's shoe and a music keyboard. The only thing that stood - surprisingly intact - was a bust of the father of the Indian nation, Mahatma Gandhi, at a traffic roundabout.\n\nThe Indian air force base in Car Nicobar was flattened by the tidal wave\n\nA senior army officer told us his team had recovered seven bodies that day and we watched their mass cremation from a distance. At the air force base, we watched as rescuers pulled a woman's body from the debris. An official said that for every body found in Car Nicobar, several had been swept away by the waves without leaving a trace.

It has not proved entirely reliable, however, resulting in viral videos of bizarre misinterpreted orders ranging from bacon-topped ice cream to hundreds of dollars' worth of chicken nuggets. McDonald's told franchisees it would remove the tech from the more than 100 restaurants it has been testing it in by the end of July, as first reported by trade publication Restaurant Business, external. \"After thoughtful review, McDonald's has decided to end our current global partnership with IBM on AOT [Automated Order Taking] beyond this year,\" the restaurant chain said in a statement. However, it added it remained confident the tech would still be \"part of its restaurants’ future.\"\n\n\"We will continue to evaluate long-term, scalable solutions that will help us make an informed decision on a future voice ordering solution by the end of the year,\" the statement said. The technology has been controversial from the outset, though initially concerns centred on its potential to make people's jobs obsolete. However, it has become apparent that replacing human restaurant workers may not be as straightforward as people initially feared - and the system's backers hoped. The AI order-taker's mishaps have been documented online. In one video, which has 30,000 views on TikTok, a young woman becomes increasingly exasperated as she attempts to convince the AI that she wants a caramel ice cream, only for it to add multiple stacks of butter to her order. In another, which has 360,000 views, a person claims that her order got confused with one being made by someone else, resulting in nine orders of tea being added to her bill. Another popular video includes two people laughing while hundreds of dollars worth of chicken nuggets are added to their order, external, while the New York Post reported another person had bacon added to their ice cream in error, external.

Emily Damari, 28, was taken by Hamas from her home in southern Israel on 7 October 2023. “I fear that she's dead,\" her mother Mandy told the BBC in her first television interview. \"And if she's not dead, she's not getting enough food to eat, she's not able to wash herself, drink water, she could be ill.\" “She's suffering from gunshot wounds to her hand and her leg... I worry every day, I worry every second because in the next second, she could be murdered, just because she's there.” Mandy Damari, who was born in Surrey, called on the British government to do more to ensure humanitarian supplies go to the hostages while negotiations continue for their release. She also welcomed US President-elect Donald Trump’s statement that there would be “hell to pay” if the hostages were not released before he takes office in January, saying: “It made me a bit more optimistic”.\n\nHamas gunmen shot Emily and killed her dog when they attacked Kibbutz Kfar Aza almost 14 months ago. Mandy also hid as Hamas stormed her home and was only saved when one of the bullets jammed the lock of the room she was hiding in. About 1,200 people were killed that day, while Emily and 250 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages. The US, Egypt and Qatar have spent months working on a deal to secure the release of the 97 remaining hostages in return for a ceasefire in Gaza. But the negotiations have stalled, with Hamas and Israel blaming each other for the impasse. Without directly mentioning Hamas or Gaza, Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday: “Everybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire world, in the Middle East - but it’s all talk, and no action!\" \"If the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against humanity,” he warned. Mrs Damari said the post “gave me a bit of hope that maybe someone does really care about what's going on there”. “Someone has to do something and take strong action to get them released. And that's the strongest thing I've heard anyone say for a long time.” She said she hoped Trump would do everything in his power to get her daughter and the other hostages released.\n\nEmily Damari loves to watch Tottenham play, her mother said\n\nMrs Damari - who describes her daughter as a Spurs football fan who loves coming to the UK to visit family, go shopping and visit pubs - is disappointed with the British government. She is currently in the UK meeting political leaders, including the prime minister. But she described the government’s recent decision to back a draft UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza as not doing enough to ensure the release of the hostages. The draft did demand their release, but it was vetoed by the US, which said it did not make that a precondition for a ceasefire. “I felt really like they were stabbing me in the heart. There was no prerequisite to release the hostages... It was basically signing a death warrant for her [Emily], because if there's a ceasefire with no release of the hostages, the hostages will stay there forever,” Mrs Damari said.\n\nMandy Damari wants the UK to do more to ensure aid supplies go to the hostages while negotiations continue for their release\n\nShe now wants them to do more. “I really need the British government if they are not able to get her released immediately, at least to get her humanitarian aid or a sign of life, and let me know what's happening with that, because I'm desperate for a sign of life.” She added: “We talk about humanitarian aid all the time to Gaza, but I don't hear about humanitarian aid for the hostages who are held in despicable conditions. I'm desperate to get humanitarian aid into her, for someone to see her. It's a human right to allow to allow people to see what's happening to her.” Mrs Damari initially did not speak out publicly about her daughter because she trusted the governments and negotiators to get her released. But now she wants the British public to understand a dual citizen is being held. “She is the only British hostage being held... and I want people to help me to get her out, to be her voice because she can’t call out for herself. She has no voice.” More than 44,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a military campaign in response to the 7 October attack, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."}

There are currently more than 22,500 children in nursery schools and pre-schools in Northern Ireland. Fewer than half of those children go to pre-school for 4.5 hours a day with the majority going \"part-time\" for 2.5 hours a day. Mr Givan recently announced that all children would be entitled to attend pre-school \"full-time\" for 22.5 hours a week as part of a wider strategy for childcare and early years.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Executive has decided to spend an initial £25m on helping parents with childcare costs, which includes £5m to increase hours for pupils in pre-school.

Joining forces would create one of the world's biggest car producers alongside Toyota, Volkswagen, General Motors and Ford. The potentially multibillion dollar deal to combat \"the rise of Chinese power\" was a key driver behind the plan, said Honda's chief executive Toshihiro Mibe. Mr Mi", "continuation": "be said a plan to \"fight back\" needs to be in place by 2030, or they risk being \"beaten\" by rivals.\n\nThe merger, which would include Mitsubishi - of which Nissan is the biggest shareholder - would allow all three companies to share resources against other electric vehicle competitors such as Tesla. The growing electric car market has been increasingly dominated by Chinese-made electric vehicles, including BYD, which have posed a threat to some of the world's best known car firms. \"There is a rise of Chinese power and emerging forces and the structure of the automobile industry is changing,\" Mr Mibe told reporters at a press conference announcing the merger talks. Growing competition in China has left many car makers struggling to compete, as lower labour and manufacturing costs make local firms more nimble and able to price their goods lower than foreign counterparts, making them far more attractive to buyers. It has led to China becoming the world's biggest producer of electric vehicles. In October, EU officials said the Chinese state was unfairly subsidising its EV makers and announced big taxes on imports of EVs from China to the EU, after the majority of member states backed the plans. The tariffs are set to rise from 10% to 45% for the next five years, but there are concerns it could raise EV prices higher for buyers.\n\nThe total sales of Nissan and Honda is more than $191bn (£152bn), said Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida. In March, the two Japanese car makers agreed to explore a strategic partnership for electric vehicles (EVs). \"The talks started because we believe that we must build up capabilities to fight them, including the current emerging forces, by 2030. Otherwise we will be beaten\", said Mr Mibe. He added that the deal was not a bailout of Nissan, which has been struggling with falling sales. In November, Nissan said it will cut around 9,000 jobs as it slashes global production to tackle a drop in sales in China and the US. The cuts mean its global production will be reduced by a fifth. Nissan, once a symbol of Japan's car making strength, has spent the past few years trying to regain its footing after the arrest of longtime chief executive Carlos Ghosn. Mr Ghosn faced charges of financial misconduct when he fled Japan in 2019, and is currently the subject of an Interpol Red Notice, which is a request to law enforcement worldwide to find and arrest a person. Mr Ghosn, currently in Lebanon, told reporters in December that Nissan's merger plans were an act of panic and desperation. Mr Mibe said that any merger would be dependent on the turnaround of Nissan. Honda and Nissan agreed in March to cooperate in their EV businesses, and in August deepened their ties, agreeing to work together on batteries and other technology. However, any deal is likely to come under intense political scrutiny in Japan as it may result in job cuts, whilst Nissan is likely to unwind its alliance with French auto firm Renault."}

They have used things like a dancefloor that generates electricity when fans jump up and down, and have cut down on air travel. They have also revealed that seven million saplings have been planted as part of a commitment to grow a tree for every fan attending the shows. \"As a band, and as an industry, we’re a long way from where we need to be on this,\" they said in a statement. \"But we’re grateful for everyone’s help so far, and we salute everyone who’s making efforts to push things in the right direction.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

In February, The 1975 played four \"carbon removed\" gigs at London's O2 Arena.

{"context": "What is rage-baiting and why is it profitable?\n\nWinta Zesu has made a business out of rage-baiting\n\n“I get a lot of hate”. The words of content creator Winta Zesu, who last year made $150,000 (£117,000) from posting on social media. What separates Winta from other influencers? The people commenting on her posts and driving traffic to her videos are often doing so out of anger. “Every single video of mine that has gained millions of views is because of hate comments,” the 24-year-old explains. In those videos, she documents the life of a New York City model, whose biggest problem is being too pretty. What some in the comments don’t realise, is that Winta is playing a character. “I get a lot of nasty comments, people say ‘you're not the prettiest girl’ or ‘please bring yourself down, you have too much confidence’,” she says to the BBC from her New York City apartment.\n\nWinta is part of a growing group of online creators making ‘rage bait’ content, where the goal is simple: record videos, produce memes and write posts that make other users viscerally angry, then bask in the thousands, or even millions, of shares and likes. It differs from its internet-cousin clickbait, where a headline is used to tempt a reader to click through to view a video or article. As marketing podcaster Andrea Jones notes: “A hook reflects what's in that piece of content and comes from a place of trust, whereas rage-baiting content is designed to be manipulative.” But ", "continuation": "the grip negative content has on human psychology is something that is hardwired into us, according to Dr William Brady, who studies how the brain interacts with new technologies. “In our past, this is the kind of content that we really needed to pay attention to,” he explains, “so we have these biases built into our learning and our attention.”\n\nAndréa Jones is on a mission to make the internet a friendlier place\n\nThe growth in rage baiting content has coincided with the major social media platforms paying creators more for their content. These creator programs - which reward users for likes, comments and shares, and allow them to post sponsored content - have been linked to its rise. “If we see a cat, we're like ‘oh, that's cute’ and scroll on. But if we see someone doing something obscene, we may type in the comments ‘this is terrible’, and that sort of comment is seen as a higher quality engagement by the algorithm,” explains marketing podcaster Andréa Jones. \"The more content a user creates the more engagement they get, the more that they get paid. \"And so, some creators will do anything to get more views, even if it is negative or inciting rage and anger in people,” she says with a note of concern. \"It leads to disengagement.\" Rage bait content comes in many forms, from outrageous food recipes, to attacks on your favourite popstar. But in a year of global elections, particularly in the US, rage baiting has spread to politics too. As Dr Brady observes: \"There has been a spike in the build up to elections, because it's an effective way to mobilize your political group to potentially vote and take action.” He notes the American election was light on policy, and instead centred around outrage, adding, “it was hyper-focused on ‘Trump is horrible for this reason’ or ‘Harris is horrible for that reason’.”\n\nWilliam Brady says elections this year have cause a spike in rage-baiting\n\nAn investigation from BBC social media investigations correspondent Marianna Spring found some users on X were being paid \"thousands of dollars\" by the social media site, for sharing content including misinformation, AI-generated images and unfounded conspiracy theories. Some who study the trends are concerned that too much negative content can lead to the average person “switching off”. “It can be draining to have such high emotions all the time,” says Ariel Hazel, assistant professor of communication and media at the University of Michigan. “It turns them off the news environment and we're seeing increased amounts of active news avoidance around the world.” Others worry about normalising anger offline and the eroding effects on people’s trust in the content they view. “Algorithms amplify outrage, it makes people think it's more normal,” says social psychologist Dr William Brady. He adds: “What we know from certain platforms like X is that politically extreme content is actually produced by a very small fraction of the user base, but algorithms can amplify it as if they were more of a majority.”\n\nThe BBC contacted the main social media platforms about rage bait on their sites, but had no responses. In October 2024, Meta executive Adam Mosseri posted on Threads, external about “an increase in engagement-bait\" on the platform, adding, “we’re working to get it under control.” While Elon Musk’s rival platform X, recently announced a change, external to its Creator Revenue Sharing Program which will see creators compensated based on engagement from the site’s premium users - such as likes, replies, and reposts. Previously compensation was based on ads viewed by premium users. TikTok and YouTube allow users to make money from their posts or to share sponsored content too, but have rules which allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation. X does not have guidelines on misinformation in the same way. Back in Winta Zesu’s New York City apartment, the conversation – which is taking place days before the US election - turns to politics. “Yeah, I don't agree with people using rage bait for political reasons,” the content creator says. \"If they're using it genuinely to educate and inform people, it's fine. But if they're using it to spread misinformation, I totally do not agree with that."}
{"context": "Ten Hag is the first Manchester United manager to win trophies in back-to-back seasons since Sir Alex Ferguson\n\nIt is more than two weeks since Erik ten Hag's Manchester United beat Manchester City in an FA Cup final billed as potentially his last game. United chiefs launched a review into the club’s season following that surprise win over rivals City, yet there is still no decision about the Dutchman's future. The build-up to the game was dominated by talk of manager Ten Hag’s chances of keeping his job. Some went so far as to state that Ten Hag would be sacked no matter what the outcome at Wembley, saying the Dutchman would pay the price for a terrible season in which United finished eighth - their worst performance since the 1989-90 campaign when Sir Alex Ferguson came close to losing his job. Ten Hag stood his ground and in an interview in the Netherlands said he had been told new co-owners Ineos wanted to rebuild the club \"with me\". It turned out that assessment was a bit of a stretch. Ten Hag was reflecting his impression of a number of previous conversations with Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Sir Dave Brailsford and Jason Wilcox, the Ineos team initially responsible for running the football side at Old Trafford following the change of ownership. In reality, United were committed to a full review at the end of the season, with the manager’s future seen as part of that.\n\nErik ten Hag being congratulated by Sir Jim Ratcliffe after the FA Cup final\n\nIt is fair to say most members of the media and many fans thought the review would have been completed by now and Ten Hag would know his fate. But in beating City - and ensuring European qualification they had looked set to miss out on - the 54-year-old became the first United boss to win trophies in successive seasons since Sir Alex Ferguson. That allowed him to issue a blunt warning to his employers: “When I started here I said I am here to win and also that I want to build a team. I am doing both. But if they don’t want me any more I will go and win and games and trophies somewhere else.” ", "continuation": "Ten Hag headed off on holiday and United’s hierarchy began their end-of-season review, stressing no decision around the manager would be taken until it was complete. Within a couple of days it became apparent that anyone who thought the review would just be a speedy resume of the season or a box ticking exercise to put an appropriate gap between Ten Hag’s triumph and a dismissal were wrong. United sources were adamant they had not set a timeline on the review. Assumptions of a resolution by the end of last week were also incorrect and, as we move into a third week, still there has been no suggestion an announcement is pending. In the meantime, Ten Hag can only wait. When he was linked with now filled vacancies at former clubs Ajax and Bayern Munich in the spring, it was underlined his only interest was managing United, where he still has a year left on his contract. Various names have been touted as his successor, including Kieran McKenna, who has since signed an extension to his contract at Ipswich, Gareth Southgate, Graham Potter and Thomas Frank. This weekend, it was reported, including by BBC Sport, that Thomas Tuchel no longer wishes to be considered for a vacancy that presently does not exist, having met Ratcliffe in Monaco in the last week. United have not confirmed the meeting, nor expressed a view on the optics around such a chat. In addition, interest in Mauricio Pochettino, who was in the frame for the United job when Ten Hag was appointed and is out of work after his exit from Chelsea, has also cooled. With all their players either on international duty or their summer break, United have no urgent need to make a final decision. Brighton, for example, are viewed as a model club when it comes to forward planning but Roberto de Zerbi announced he was quitting on 18 May, a week before the FA Cup final, and they have still not named a replacement. But all eyes are on Old Trafford and it seems no-one, including Ten Hag, can be sure what the eventual outcome will be."}

{"context": "NHS gets 12 years to roll out new weight-loss drug Mounjaro\n\nA new weight-loss jab will be rolled out on the NHS in England - but it could take 12 years for everyone to receive", "continuation": " it, the NHS drugs advisory body says. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) final draft guidance on Mounjaro has recommended it starts being given from March, alongside advice on diet and exercise. It will be offered to people with a body mass index (BMI) of more than 35 and at least one obesity-related health problem - potentially 3.4 million people. But because of concerns it could overwhelm services, and in particular GPs, NICE has agreed to give the NHS more than a decade to introduce it - an unprecedented move for a medication.\n• None Weight loss injections: How do drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro work?\n\nNICE chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Benger acknowledged it would mean “many people would have to wait”. But he said: “We’ve had to make this difficult decision in order to protect vital NHS services and also to test ways of delivering this new generation of weight-loss medications.” Patient groups have expressed disappointment at the decision to give the NHS so long.\n\nOnly those patients under the care of specialist weight-management services will be offered it initially – matching the approach taken with a similar weight-loss drug, Wegovy. But from June, the NHS will start offering it to others. It is unclear exactly how this will be done – GP practices are likely to be in charge of referring patients, but questions remain over who will be providing the ongoing support involving diet and exercise and monitoring. NHS England is expected to publish guidance on this in the new year. It could involve the use of apps or separate services being established to support GPs. Mounjaro, or tirzepatide, which is made by Eli Lilly, makes you feel fuller so you eat less. In trials, people on it have lost a fifth of their body weight.\n\nIn the US, the FDA approved Mounjaro for blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes in 2022\n\nWegovy, also known as semaglutide, which is already available on the NHS, works in a similar way. But that can only be given to those under the care of specialist weight-loss management. There are around 40,000 people estimated to be in that position. The drugs can be bought privately. Both medicines are also already available for people with type 2 diabetes – although semaglutide is marketed as Ozempic for those patients. The rollout of Mounjaro opens up the option of this new generation of weight-loss drugs to the wider public who are struggling with severe obesity. To be eligible, patients will also need to have one obesity-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease. Under the rollout plans, those with the highest clinical need will be prioritised first. It is estimated around 220,000 will benefit in the first three years. NICE then plans to evaluate how that is working, before pushing ahead with the wider rollout. As this is final draft guidance, it is still possible rollout could be delayed if there are any appeals made against the decision. If there is not, the guidance will be rubber-stamped before Christmas, NICE said.\n\nMounjaro, which is given via weekly injections, will cost the NHS £122 per patient per month for the maximum dose, but NICE judged it to be cost-effective given the cost of obesity. There is a risk that users can put weight back on once they stop using it. Ministers in Wales will be using the guidance from NICE to inform their rollout. It is already recommended for use in Scotland – although the NHS is reportedly struggling with its rollout. Helen Kirrane, of Diabetes UK, said Mounjaro had a “significant” role to play in tackling obesity. But she added: “We have concerns over the length of time it might take for people to gain access.” Dr Kath McCullough, NHS England’s national specialty adviser for obesity, said weight-loss drugs were an “important tool” to help tackle “one of the greatest public health issues facing the NHS”. She said the phased rollout was needed to protect access to other NHS services that patients rely on. And Prof Kamila Hawthorne, of the Royal College of GPs, warned the drug should not be seen as a \"silver bullet\", adding that it did not come without risk and would not be the right course of treatment for everyone who is eligible.\n\nAre you affected by the issues raised in the story?

{"context": "The world's fossil fuel industries should be banned from advertising to help save the world from climate change, the head of the United Nations said on Wednesday. UN Secretary General António Guterres called coal, oil and gas corporations the “godfathers of climate chaos” who had distorted the truth and deceived the public for decades. Just as tobacco advertising was banned because of the threat to health, the same should now apply to fossil fuels, he said. His remarks were his most damning condemnation yet of the industries responsible for the bulk of global warming. They came as new studies showed the rate of warming is increasing and that global heat records have continued to tumble. Data from the EU's climate service confirms that each of the past 12 months set a new global temperature record for the time of year. The high temperatures were driven by human-caused climate change, although they were also given a small boost by the El Niño climate phenomenon.\n\nWhile a fading El Niño should soon bring a pause to the record-breaking sequence of months, temperatures will continue to rise in the long-term due to emissions of planet-warming gases from human activities. Last year was the hottest on record and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Wednesday that the record could fall again as soon as this year. A group of around 50 leading scientists separately reported that the rate of global warming caused by humans has continued to increase. They found that ongoing high emissions of warming gases mean the world is moving closer to breaching the symbolic 1.5C warming mark on a longer-term basis. To try to avert this outcome, the UN Secretary General has called for more rapid political action on climate change, and a “clampdown” on the fossil fuel industry. “We must directly confront those in the fossil fuel industry who have shown relentless zeal for obstructing progress – over decades.” He said many in the oil, gas and coal industries had “shamelessly greenwashed” with lobbying, legal action and massive advertising campaigns. “I urge every country to ban advertising from fossil fuel companies,” he told an audience in New York. In response, representatives of fossil fuel groups said they were committed to reducing their emissions. “Our industry is focused on continuing to produce affordable, reliable energy while tackling the climate challenge, and any allegations to the contrary are false,” said Megan Bloomgren, Senior Vice President of Communications at the American Petroleum Foundation.\n\nUN Secretary General António Guterres has long been a critic of fossil fuel use, and is now calling for global ban on advertising by coal, oil and gas producers.\n\nThe UK Advertising Standards Authority has previously pledged to clamp down on misleading environmental claims, while the European Union recently announced a new law to tackle the problem, external. Mr Guterres' call for an outright ban on all fossil fuel advertising goes further - but it has no legal standing, and the UN has no means of enforcing the idea. However, it will be seen as a boost for campaigners who have fought against sponsorship and advertising from coal, oil and gas companies. Both the Hay and Edinburgh book festivals have recently suspended sponsorship from investment company Baillie Gifford following controversy over links to fossil fuel firms. Sport is one of the biggest areas of fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship, with football having a long association with oil and gas producers. Concerns over human health have seen alcohol and tobacco sponsorship banned in football in the past, and green campaigners will be hoping that the support of Mr Guterres will see fossil fuels go the same way. In his address, Mr Guterres stressed that time was of the essence, with the impacts of rising temperatures already being felt - such as the recent deadly heatwaves in Asia or the floods in South America.\n\nDeadly floods hit Brazil last month, and scientists at the World Weather Attribution group said the heavy rain was made at least twice as likely by climate change\n\nThe record-breaking global heat means that average temperatures over the past 12 months have been 1.63C above \"pre-industrial levels\" of the late 1800s, according to Copernicus data. \"We are living in unprecedented times,\" says Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus. This does not constitute a breach of the Paris climate agreement, in which nearly 200 countries pledged to try to keep temperature rises below 1.5C, in order to try to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change. That is because the Paris agreement is generally understood to mean a 20-year avera", "continuation": "ge - to smooth out natural variability. Taken as a whole, the past decade was about 1.2C warmer than pre-industrial levels.\n\nBut a new study released today, external by a group of leading climate scientists highlighted how close the world is getting to a long-term breach of the 1.5C mark. They estimate that from the start of 2024 the world could only emit around 200 billion more tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) for a 50/50 chance of keeping warming to 1.5C - down from 500 billion tonnes at the beginning of 2020. At current rates of emissions, this \"carbon budget\" could be exhausted by 2029 - although the world would probably not pass the long-term 1.5C mark until a few years later, because of warming effects from greenhouse gases other than CO2. There are uncertainties about how exactly the climate system will react to these factors, and of course whether countries make urgent cuts to emissions. \"We have a bit of control over this as a society,\" says lead author Prof Piers Forster, director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures at the University of Leeds. Despite the gloom, there has been some recent progress, with particularly rapid growth in renewable wind and solar electricity. Greenhouse gas emissions are also showing signs of plateauing - but they are still at record highs. They need to fall quickly if global targets have a chance of being met, with every fraction of a degree of warming worsening climate impacts. \"Every degree matters; every tenth of a degree matters,\" says Ko Barrett, WMO Deputy Secretary General. \"The difference between 1.5C and say 2C could mean [...] dire consequences, for coastal communities, for fragile ecosystems, and the biodiversity that is contained within them, and for glaciers and the frozen parts of the world.\""}

The two-time former unified world heavyweight champion told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs he would much prefer if his son Joseph Joshua, known as JJ, became an accountant instead, though he added that he wanted him to carve out his own future. Joshua also spoke to host Lauren Laverne about how he got into trouble with the police for fighting when he was a teenager living in Watford and how he became homeless aged 17. Reflecting on his career in boxing, Joshua said he found the sport at a time he needed it most.\n\nHe told Desert Island Discs: \"I’d usually sit outside the estate and just have a cigarette. Then I started getting in trouble... I just wanted to make money, that was my goal,\" he told the programme. “I was constantly getting in trouble.\" Joshua first entered the ring aged 18 when his cousin suggested he take up the sport, which he said became helpful to \"channel my energy\". Five years later, Joshua became a household name when he picked up gold at the London 2012 Olympics.\n\nThe 34-year-old said boxing helped him and that he now wants to help others.\n\nA year later, Joshua decided to turn pro - the breakout moment for him coming at age 27, when he met the Ukrainian Wladimir Klitschko in April 2017. In a sold out Wembley Stadium, roared on by a crowd of 90,000, AJ - as he is known to his fans - floored the 41-year old two-time world champion in the 11th round in one of the most gruelling but entertaining heavyweight contests. Later, he said the victory over Klitschko changed his career. AJ won all of his first 22 professional bouts, 21 of them inside the distance, to establish himself as the most renowned knockout artist of his generation. But the low point in the boxer’s career came in 2022, when he failed to recapture the unified WBO, WBA and IBF heavyweight titles from his nemesis, Ukraine’s Oleksandr Usyk in Saudi Arabia. As", "continuation": " he tried to come to terms with the loss, Joshua at first denied it had a profound effect on him. “I don’t feel anything,” he had said after Usyk defeated him in a spectacular rematch, before throwing two championship belts from the ring. But at a post-fight press conference, Joshua was apologetic, choked back tears and held his head in his hands, saying the defeat “tore him apart”. Speaking to Desert Island Discs, he said he has broken down over losing - adding that one time he went into a \"dark room\" for five days where he could not talk to anyone in order to \"heal from the inside mentally\".\n\nJoshua said it was around this time that he realised he needed to have \"more meaningful conversations\" with his family. Beyond the world of boxing, AJ is known to be a fiercely private man for whom loyalty to family is of paramount importance. He grew up as one of seven children living between his mum's house and his dad's place. In various interviews he spoke fondly about his mother Yeta Odusanya, and his son, JJ. Soon after his career took off, he bought a place for his mum to live in. “When you step up as a man in the house, freedom is making sure your parents are taken care of as well,\" he told the BBC. \"For me, that’s freedom knowing that no matter where I am in the world, my mum’s happy, she’s taken care of.\"\n\nJoshua says he has \"always kept boxing out\" away from his family, adding that he is a father and son first. Would he like his son to enter the ring? He has previously said he did not envisage that life for his \"little JJ\", wanting his son to be the \"best man that he can be\" instead. Speaking to Desert Island Discs, Joshua revealed that his views about his son’s future had not changed. He said he would tell JJ to \"do the best you can do\", when advising him about what he wanted to be when he was older. \"If I was to choose [a career] for him, I would ask him to probably look at accountancy because I think it’s good to understand numbers,\" he said. But what about his own future? Does he plan to retire? There are no plans for retirement yet, but he said that when he eventually leaves the sport he would like to start a care home for retired boxers with poor health. “That would be part of my boxing legacy, that I gave something back to the sport that made me,\" he said. \"I know I’m not going to be in the hot-seat for all my life, so I have to make smart decisions while the iron’s hot.”"}
{"context": "The Conservative Party is promising to recruit 8,000 additional police officers over the next three years if they win the General Election. Under the plans, the new neighbourhood police officers would also be given increased powers to seize knives and recover stolen goods. The policing uplift programme would partly be paid for by increasing visa fees and removing the student discount to the Immigration Health surcharge, the party said. Labour said the government had \"decimated neighbourhood policing\" since coming to power in 2010, describing the pledge as \"another empty promise\".\n\nThe Tory party suggested the new, \"fully warranted\" officers would join neighbourhood policing teams across the country - promising the equivalent of one additional police officer for every ward in England and Wales. \"Abstraction\" of the new recruits - where officers are pulled off their beat to fill gaps elsewhere in the force - would only be permitted in \"exceptional circumstances\", the Conservatives said. Policing minister Chris Philp told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the new officers would be \"dedicated\" to neighbourhood policing. \"That means policing our local areas and responding to local crime investigation requirements,\" he added. He said his party had kicked off a \"recruitment spree\" in 2019 and were now proposing to go \"even further\". The new police officers would join the 20,000 already recruited since 2019, the Tories added. However, critics say the 20,000 officers recruited since the last general election - as part of a major 2019 election pledge by the Conservatives - had simply replaced the 20,000 officers who left the force between 2010 and 2019, after government funding was cut by 20%. In addition to boosting neighbourhood policing teams, the new measures would strengthen police powers to seize and destroy blades such as \"Zombie\" knives and machetes, the Conservatives said. Police would also be able to enter premises without a warrant to seize stolen goods such as phones, the party added. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: \"More bobbies on the beat and increased powers will give police forces the tools they need to drive down neighb", "continuation": "ourhood crime even further.\"\n\nThe Conservatives took aim at Labour's pledge to boost local police patrols by 13,000 if they win the general election, claiming only 3,000 officers would be \"fully warranted\" and \"full time\". This is because part of Labour's total number of new recruits would be comprised of PSCOs - officers who share some, but not all of the powers afforded to police - as well as special constables, external, who work on a voluntary basis. Labour told the BBC all the positions created under a Labour government would be \"full time\". The party says it would fund the move by cutting \"back-office waste\". Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said: “The Tories have repeatedly promised more police on the beat but instead they have cut 10,000 neighbourhood police, 90% of crimes are going unsolved, prisons are in crisis and more than twice as many people now say they never see the police on the beat.\"\n\nShe said the Conservatives had costed the policy on the basis of \"a fudge that seem to depend on continued high migration which they promised to bring down\". Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats said the Conservatives had funnelled money \"into pet projects instead of bobbies on the beat\". \"6,000 crimes are still going unsolved every day, including three in four of all burglaries and car thefts,\" Liberal Democrats spokesperson Alistair Carmichael said. \"Clearly, the Conservative Party's previous uplift pledge has not delivered the community policing that British people deserve. \"What makes these half-baked plans any different?\""}

{"context": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe Russian government has cautioned against promoting \"hypotheses\" about the cause of the crash of a Russia-bound passenger plane that killed 38 people in Kazakhstan on Wednesday. Some aviation experts suggested that the Azerbaijan Airlines plane had been hit by air defence systems over the Russian republic of Chechnya and pro-government media in Azerbaijan quote officials as saying a Russian missile was responsible. Before it went down near the Kazakh city of Aktau, the plane was diverted across the Caspian Sea, from its destination in Chechnya to western Kazakhstan. Twenty nine of the 67 people on board survived. Azerbaijan held a national day of mourning on Thursday for the victims of the crash.\n\nThe Embraer 190 caught fire and split apart as it landed\n\n\"This is a great tragedy that has become a tre", "continuation": "mendous sorrow for the Azerbaijani people,\" President Ilham Aliyev said on Thursday. In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \"It would be wrong to put forward any hypotheses before the investigation's conclusions. We, of course, will not do this, and no-one should do this. We need to wait until the investigation is completed.\" The chief prosecutor in Kazakhstan said later that the investigation had not yet come to any conclusions. But some commentators in Azerbaijani media say that Azerbaijan expects Russia to admit shooting down the plane. Several TV channels, which are under strict control of the Azerbaijani government, on Thursday started broadcasting interviews with experts who have openly spoken about the possibility that Russia was responsible. AnewZ channel said a preliminary investigation had concluded that the plane had been hit by shrapnel from a surface-to-air missile from Russia's Pantsir-S defence system. Another pro-government website, Caliber, quoted government sources as saying that no-one was claiming the plane had come under attack intentionally, but that Baku expected an apology from Russia. When asked about the reports, the chief prosecutor's office in Baku told the BBC that every version was being investigated. As they try to avoid annoying Russian President Vladimir Putin, it will be very difficult for the Azerbaijani government to blame Russia directly unless it admits to shooting down the plane. It seems that the investigation committee comprised of Azerbaijani and Kazakh officials possibly already have evidence for this, but they are waiting for Russia to announce it first. Moscow will then have to answer questions such as why Russia did not close its airspace if there was military activity, and why it did not let the plane land as soon as possible - instead of directing it towards Aktau for landing.\n\nAre you in the area? Did you witness the crash? Only get in touch if it is safe to do so.\n\nThe Embraer 190 aircraft took off from the Azerbaijani capital Baku on Wednesday morning. It was due to fly to Grozny in Chechnya but it was diverted because of fog, the airline said. A surviving passenger told Russian TV he believed the pilot had tried twice to land in dense fog over Grozny before \"the third time, something exploded... some of the aircraft skin had blown out\". The plane was redirected to Aktau airport, some 450km (280 miles) to the east. Footage shows the aircraft heading towards the ground at high speed 3km (1.9 miles) short of the runway, before bursting into flames as it lands. Kazakh authorities have recovered the flight data recorder and an investigation is under way. Shortly after the crash, reports from Russian state-controlled TV said the most likely cause was a strike from a flock of birds. But that kind of collision typically results in the plane gliding towards the nearest airfield, aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia told Reuters news agency. \"You can lose control of the plane, but you don't fly wildly off course as a consequence,\" he said. Justin Crump of risk advisory company Sibylline said the pattern of damage inside and outside the plane indicated that Russian air defence active in Grozny may have caused the crash. \"It looks very much like the detonation of an air defence missile to the rear and to the left of the aircraft, if you look at the pattern of shrapnel that we see,\" he told BBC Radio 4.\n\nChechnya has already been hit by Ukrainian drone strikes this month and authorities in neighbouring Ingushetia said the Russian region had been targeted for the first time since the war in Ukraine began. A shopping centre was hit when a drone was shot down in nearby North Ossetia, killing one woman, reports said. Those on board were mostly Azerbaijani nationals, but there were also some passengers from Russia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Video footage showed survivors crawling out of the wreckage, some with visible injuries. The injured were taken to hospital. On Thursday, Azerbaijan's Azertac news agency said seven were in a good enough condition to fly back to Baku. Azerbaijan Airlines told reporters that the plane had been fully serviced in October and had no technical malfunctions. Embraer, a Brazilian manufacturer and a smaller rival to Boeing and Airbus, has a strong safety record."}

The attack on the 40-year-old, which Stimpson filmed on his phone, happened on 27 December last year in Cardiff city centre. During sentencing at Cardiff Crown Court on Monday, Judge Jeremy Jenkins said the attack was “gratuitous, repeated and sustained violence against a woman in no position to defend”.\n\n“You completely humiliated her – you took the last ounce of dignity from her,” Judge Jenkins told Stimpson, describing the attack as “bordering on sadistic”. In a statement read out on her behalf, the victim said it had “changed my whole opinion of men”. “I want this male to end up in prison for what he has done. I worry about him doing this to another female,” she said. “I’m unable to socialise with others at the moment. I just want to be alone, to block out what has happened to me.” Rhianydd Jones from the Crown Prosecution Service said the case \"highlights the extreme violence and disregard for human dignity exhibited by the defendant\", thanking the jury for their “careful consideration”, as well as the victim for coming forward.

First conceived during the pandemic, the museum’s new Namedropping exhibition explores why humans chase things that signal status and notoriety.\n\nWu-Tang Clan's unique flavour of hip-hop revolutionised the genre when they burst onto the scene in the 1990s\n\nAt the top of lead curator Jarrad Rawlins’ wish list for the exhibition was this album. “If I'm completely honest it started as a fantasy… we were in a meeting and I just said, ‘We should get that Wu-Tang CD’, and everyone went ‘Yeah. Lol’,” he says. After years of negotiation, fans from all over the globe have now flocked to Mona to hear a 36-minute sample of the album, curated especially by Wu-Tang Clan producer Cilvaringz. What can the few dozen people who scored tickets to the uber-exclusive listening parties expect? Mr Rawlins teases a Cher cameo – his favourite bit – but otherwise is tight-lipped. “The more we know about this album, and the more people out there know, the less magical it becomes,” he insists. “I think the fans are as excited about not being able to hear it… as they are about being able to hear it.” But somewhat ironically, the week that Namedropping opens, news breaks that the company loaning the album is suing its previous owner – disgraced “pharma bro” Martin Shkreli – for allegedly making digital copies. He was forced to hand over the album to US prosecutors in 2018 – three years after purchasing it – after being convicted of defrauding investors. It was bought by digital art collective Pleasr for a rumoured $4m (A$6m; £3.2m), value they’re trying to preserve by making Shkreli destroy his bootleg files. Since 2015, fans have heard snippets of the mysterious music – from potential buyers treated to a 13-minute segment when it was first released, to the handful of times Shkreli streamed scraps on YouTube, and now a five-minute clip which the public can buy for a single dollar. But never this much of it. As I queue up for my listening session, a contract demanding that I don’t record it is thrust into my hands. “Your obligations under this agreement start on your entry to Once Upon a Time in Shaolin and continue for the remainder of your life or until 2103, whichever occurs first,” it reads. And when we reach Mona’s Frying Pan Studio itself, I realise the jokes I’ve been hearing about metal detectors are not jokes at all. One by one, we’re asked to take off our coats, ditch our bags, and empty our pockets, before we are diligently scanned.\n\nWalking into the dimly lit, wood-panelled room the air feels charged – but that could be the storm sounds playing over the speakers. “Green tea on the left,” a staff member tells me. In the middle of the room, under a spotlight, is a PlayStation One sitting atop a round yellow table. Weaving between pleather bean bags – also yellow – to plonk himself in the front row is a man wearing merch from a Wu-Tang 25th anniversary concert at the Sydney Opera House six years ago. He’s with his partner, who I later catch mid bean-bag-boogie. I make a mental note to find them later. As I take my seat in a black wiry chair, I clock several security guards. A gong rings, and then silence, as a man with gloved hands walks to the front of the room. Swinging his arm in an exaggerated arch, he presses a button on the PlayStation, and then slips the CD inside. In equally dramatic measure, he picks up the controller and hits play. A member of the group – I’ve not studied hard enough to work out which – tells us to “sit back, relax… and listen”. “The saga continues,” he says, as they launch into the first song. It has oddly soothing choir-like backing vocals, but as the minutes tick by, they give way to significantly less soothing seagulls and sirens. I hear the staccato of actual gunshots alongside synth piano, strings that would be at home in a dramatic James Bond score and a riff by some brass instrument which I’ll spend days trying to get out of my head. Formed in Staten Island in the early 90s, Wu-Tang Clan is famous for a unique flavour of hip-hop which revolutionised the genre - but they’re also known for their violent and sexually explicit lyrics. This record is no different. Inside the leather-bound lyric book that accompanies the physical album you’d find plenty of references to sex and marijuana, and the classic Wu-Tang themes of money and toil, youth and crime are ever-present. And on the topic of namedropping, everyone from Tommy Hilfiger and Tina Turner to Rapunzel and Harry Potter gets a shout out.\n\nA close up of the leather lyric book\n\nBehind the glass at the control deck, technicians are mixing the music live – adjusting the levels for each song’s attributes. One man looks over their shoulders approvingly, bobbing his head like a rhythmically talented chicken. Here on my side of the divide, some people reverently sit with their eyes closed while others stare at the ceiling. Many tap fingers on their cups of cold tea. Suddenly, the gloved man is back. He again walks to the front of the room in silence. Removing the CD, he slips it into a nondescript plastic case and walks to a safe, flanked by security guards. When the album is safely locked inside, there’s a smattering of applause, and everyone files out of the room. Initially, I’m overwhelmed. I don’t think I’ve ever heard so many words in my life. I feel like I’ve been assaulted by a dictionary. I have just as many questions walking out of the studio as I had going in – maybe more. Was that a flute? In a rap song? What exactly was the message of the lyrics? Who was singing what? And most importantly, where was the Cher cameo I was promised?! Was the curator messing with me? I ask some of the journalists I’m with if they heard her. We all look confused. “Maybe she was on keys?” I say. I single out Wu-Tang Merch man, whose real name is Al Maguire. But if you think he’s buzzing now, you should have seen him in the moments before the “funky tunes” rang out. “The first three minutes I was just trying not to cry.” He’s already sad he won’t hear it again, he says. Superfan Jenna Willson is similarly emotional when I catch her, decked out literally head to toe in Wu-Tang tributes. She gallantly takes off her jacket in single digit weather to show me a tattoo on the back of her neck, a t-shirt from the Opera House show that apparently everyone here but me attended, and then the pièce de resistance – Wu-Tang Clan crocs which she wore to her wedding.\n\n“I don't know how everybody was just sitting down, nodding their heads. I was about to lose it. It was so good… Classic Wu-Tang.” Another man I stop isn’t feeling chatty. He admits to feeling a little like an imposter – something I find relatable. He says he’s not even really a Wu-Tang fan. Lateisha Canning, though, will happily admit why she’s here. “You could say bragging rights,” the 21-year-old tells me as she lines up with her partner. “I ", "continuation": "don’t know anything about them.” By the time I see them on the way out, Wu-Tang has two new fans.\n\nBut if anyone is qualified to offer a review, it is self-described “international heartthrob and agitator” – better known as Australian rap heavyweight, Briggs. His verdict? “It’s a very cinematic record. The production was cool. Great verses.” He explains Wu-Tang Clan was a big part of his childhood and their influence wove its way into his artistry – he feels like he’s been part of hip-hop history just by listening. Asked what he thinks should happen to the album now, he laughs. “I don’t care what happens now, I’ve heard it. You can do whatever you want.”"}

In 2022, BBC News broadcast accusations by 18 women of predatory and unwanted sexual behaviour and touching by Tim Westwood, in alleged incidents from 1992 to 2017. A Met police spokesperson said: \"While consultation with the CPS is ongoing, we have asked the BBC to pause the publication of their report to allow for further time to consider any potential impact on the investigation.\"\n\nThe BBC's report, led by Gemma White KC, was commissioned by the BBC to examine Mr Westwood's employment with the broadcaster. The BBC confirmed police had requested it pause publishing this report, adding it would continue to correspond with authorities. In a statement it said it would provide a further update when there was clarity to do so. \"The police have requested that the BBC pause its intended publication of the report.

We recognise that this pause to publication will be disappointing – particularly to those who came forward to participate in the review and to whom we are very grateful. \"However, we must continuefro to ensure that any steps we take, including in relation to publication of the report, do not negatively impact any criminal process.\"\n\nIt is believed Mr Westwood has been interviewed under caution by the Metropolitan Police four times since the broadcast of the joint BBC News and the Guardian investigation. In a statement, police said the offences are alleged to have happened between 1982 and 2016. Detectives said they interviewed a man in his 60s man under caution last year. There has been no arrest. The BBC's review into Westwood's employment with the BBC was initially expected to take around six months. A freedom of information request by BBC News earlier this year revealed the BBC had spent more than £3 million on the review so far. Last month, the Met police confirmed it had made recommendations to the BBC that parts of the report \"may interfere with justice if published.\" The force had also confirmed it had submitted a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service but is continuing to make enquiries. It called the investigation \"a complex and sensitive matter\" and their \"absolute priority is to maintain the integrity of our investigation and support and retain the confidence of potential victims\". Tim Westwood stood down from his Capital Xtra show in 2022. The 67-year-old has continued to play in gigs up and down the country, despite some campaigners calling for nightclubs not to host him since the allegations emerged. He also regularly plays gigs in West Africa."}

{"context": "The Bank of England has opened the door to cutting interest rates in August in what would be the first drop in borrowing costs for more than four years. On Thursday, the Bank voted to keep interest rates at a 16-year high of 5.25% in a close-run decision. Earlier this week, figures revealed that inflation – which measures the pace of price rises – had slowed to 2% in May, which is in line with the Bank of England’s target. However, prices of some items continued to rise faster than expected. But the minutes from the Bank’s rate-setting committee signalled a significant change in tone, indicating a majority could vote for a cut when they meet again on 1 August. They say they will look at whether areas of concern are “receding”. “On that basis, the committee will keep under review for how long [the] bank rate should be maintained at its current level,\" the minutes said. While not a done deal, this language is a clear signal to the markets and the public that after the Bank completes its new forecasts for the economy, a rate cut is now the most likely outcome at its next meeting. The rate-setting committee voted 7-2 to hold rates, but the result was not as cut and dried as it had been previously. For three members, voting to hold this month was a “finely balanced” decision. Those committee members leaning towards a cut, which are understood to include Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, are playing down the strength of underlying inflationary pressures. The Bank's latest decision comes in the run-up to the general election, with policies for the future of the UK economy a key battleground for political parties. However, the Bank stressed that the timing of the election was \"not relevant to its decision\".\n\nThe Bank of England's interest rate has a knock-on effect on mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. While the Bank appears to be hinting at a cut in August, many homeowners now coming to the end of a fixed-rate deal are facing mortgage rates much higher than they have become used to. The current average rate for a two-year fixed deal is 5.96%, although this is lower than last year's peak of 6.86%.\n\nBen Perks says he was disappointed and frustrated by the rates decision\n\nMortgage adviser Ben Perks, who works in Wolverhampton, told BBC Radio 5Live that while he was not surprised by the Bank's decision to hold rates for now, he was \"definitely disappointed, certainly frustrated\". \"It's OK saying, 'Oh, we'll wait' but the reality is that 125,000 people a month are coming to the end of their fixed rates, which over a two-month period is the population of Wolverhampton city centre.\" He says he's had borrowers in tears in his office when they've found out how much their mortgage repayments are going to go up by. \"It is extremely stressful. We've had meetings when you tell them the new payments and, with the fact everything else has gone up, they don't know wh", "continuation": "ich way to turn.\"\n\nWednesday's inflation data showed that price rises for services - which reflect the cost of items such as cinema tickets, restaurant meals and holidays - remained higher than expected. But the Bank's minutes say that the slow fall in services inflation reflects one-off factors, including the rise in the minimum wage and bills that automatically rise by inflation, such as broadband and mobile. If the Bank does go ahead with an interest rate cut in August, it would be the first one since March 2020 when the UK was heading into the first Covid lockdown.\n\n“It’s good news that inflation has returned to our 2% target,\" said Bank governor Andrew Bailey. “We need to be sure that inflation will stay low and that’s why we’ve decided to hold rates at 5.25% for now.” The Bank of England is independent of the government and its main role is to keep inflation stable at 2%. In response to high inflation, the Bank in recent years has raised and then kept interest rates at a high level. The theory behind rising rates is that it will slow inflation, but it can also drag on economic growth as businesses may put off investment or hiring, which could mean fewer jobs being created."}

Currys boss Alex Baldock said the \"unwelcome\" tax changes announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves will also put a dampener on investment and hiring plans.

Currys said recent changes to tax and other government policy would increase its costs by £32m, and it had only planned for about half of that.\n\nThose costs break down as £12m from increased National Insurance contributions, £9m from the rise in the National Living Wage, £2m from business rates due to inflation, and £9m from its supply chain hiking costs due to wages and tax, the firm said in its first-half results. \"The unwelcome headwinds from UK government policy...

Dr Nigel North, clinical psychologist, said: \"You can’t take away hope. We can’t leave someone hopeless by saying this is never going to change because that would be an absolutely terrible position to leave someone in.\" For many, the healing journey involves grieving the loss of their life before their spinal injury. \"You’re mourning something which has gone and you’re not going to get it back in the way that it used to be,\" said Dr North.\n\nPatient Fearghas Powell said: \"I feel like I moan a lot but it’s because I’m just impatient with this life, I want my old life back.\" The tree surgeon was removing rotten branches from a tree in Yelverton, Dartmoor, in August 2023 when he fell 46ft (14m). \"I was hanging there for a second then I heard a click or a clunk and then I woke up on the floor,\" he said. \"I didn’t have any pain straight away, I couldn’t see, everything was just fuzzy. \"I fell from about 14m (45.9ft) I think, which is way bigger than a two-storey house.\"\n\nT", "continuation": "his video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nFor Fearghas, the focus of his rehabilitation is upper body movement and strength.

But she is struggling to find somewhere suitable for her to eventually live with her daughter again.\n\nCaroline Burson, from Alresford, Hampshire, was on holiday in Cyprus last summer when her arm \"went completely dead\". She waited with her partner for a taxi to take her to hospital but \"by the time it arrived, I was completely paralysed from the neck down\", she said. Initially doctors thought she had sunstroke, says Caroline, but an MRI scan revealed it was more serious and she was flown back to the UK by air ambulance. Caroline had suffered a spinal stroke.

{"context": "Drug lord back in Colombia after 20 years in US jail\n\nOne of the founders of the Medellin drug cartel has returned to Colombia after serving more than 20 years in jail in the US for drug trafficking. Fabio Ochoa Vasquez, now 67 years old, was deported by the US government and landed in Bogota on Monday a free man. Ochoa was one of the founding members of the notorious cartel and had been a senior lieutenant to infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar. The Medellin cartel dominated the cocaine trade and waged a violent campaign against the Colombian state before Escobar was killed in 1993.\n\nOn his arrival in Bogota, immigration officials ran Ochoa's fingerprints through their database, the country's immigration agency said. Confirming that he is not wanted by Colombian authorities, it said that Ochoa was freed \"to be reunited with his family\". Amid a sea of reporters in the airport terminal, Ochoa was greeted by his relatives and hugged his daughter. In 2001, Ochoa was flown to the US after being arrested in Colombia in 1999 along with about 30 other alleged traffickers. He had already served a jail sentence in Colombia in the early 90s for his role as one of bosses of the Medellin cartel. Along with his brothers, he was the first major trafficker to surrender under a programme that protected cartel members from extradition to the US if they pleaded guilty to minor offences in Colombia. Ochoa and his brothers were released from prison in 1996, but Ochoa was arrested once again during the so-called Millennium operation over his involvement in the cocaine smuggling business in the US in the late 1990s. In 2003, Ochoa was sentenced to more than 30 years in a US court for his involvement in the cartel that brought an average of 30 tonnes of cocaine into the US each month between 1997 and 1999.\n\nPhoto dated 1999: Ochoa is escorted by police after his arrest under the US's Operation Millennium\n\nDuring the 1980s, he was one of the top operators in Escobar's Medellin ring, a sup", "continuation": "plier in its prime of 80% of the US cocaine market.

{"context": "Gisèle Pelicot lifts her sunglasses and chooses to fight back\n\nWarning: This story contains descriptions of alleged sexual offences.\n\nThere was a moment, a few weeks into the trial, when Gisèle Pelicot decided it was time to remove her sunglasses. It wasn't just an acknowledgment of the fading autumn sunshine in the medieval southern French city of Avignon. It was also an indication that she'd passed a milestone – one of many that have marked her slow, painful journey from serene grandmother, to anguished and shame-haunted rape victim, to fearful courtroom witness, to global icon of courage and defiance. \"She had these sunglasses she used to hide her eyes… to protect her intimacy,\" said Stéphane Babonneau, the youthful criminal lawyer who for two years has guided Mrs Pelicot through the case against her ex-husband, Dominique, and fifty other men now on trial for allegedly raping her. \"But there was a point when she felt she no longer needed to protect herself. She didn't need [the glasses],\" Mr Babonneau explained, seizing on that moment as a way to illustrate the slow transformation of a \"sincere… very humble person\", who had begun the trial \"extremely worried\", shocked by the blaze of publicity, and still feeling \"very ashamed of what had happened to her\".\n\nThe Big Cases: My Husband the Monster The shocking story of Gisele Pelicot, raped by strangers her husband invited to abuse her.\n\nOver the course of the trial, Gisèle Pelicot, 72, has said almost nothing about her ordeal, beyond the occasional and brief comment to supporters gathered in Avignon's Palais de Justice. But Mr Babonneau, speaking now with his client's blessing, has begun giving us insights into the way she's handled herself in court, and the way she has slowly and methodically sought to rebuild her life and, to a limited extent, her peace of mind. Another moment - and milestone - sticks out. It was earlier this year, in May. Mr Babonneau and his colleague Antoine Camus had been trawling through some of the 20,000 grotesquely explicit videos and photographs that police discovered back in 2020 on Dominique Pelicot's computer hard drive. A grim task. The videos were \"absolutely disgusting,\" said Mr Babonneau. But it was the audio that was almost more shocking. \"It's possible to hear Mrs Pelicot snoring… to hear her breathing. It's even more disturbing to listen to her choking when some of the men are abusing her. The sound was very important [evidence].\"\n\nThe Big Cases: My Husband the Monster The shocking story of Gisele Pelicot, raped by strangers her husband invited to abuse her.\n\nMr Babonneau knew that without those videos, \"most likely there would have been no trial, no case\". Mrs Pelicot understood that too, but could easily and understandably have decided, for her own sanity, to avoid watching any of the footage herself. Instead, Mr Babonneau remembers, she simply announced one day: \"I'm ready now.\" So, she sat down beside the two men, in their office, as they introduced a carefully selected portion of each video, explaining who the men were, and what she would be seeing them do to her. Then Mr Babonneau pressed play and images of the Pelicots' bedroom, in their bungalow in the village Mazan, flashed up on the screen. \"How could he?\" she eventually asked, in her quiet voice. It was a phrase she would keep repeating over the coming days. Then a little later, she noted the date on one of the videos. \"That was my birthday evening.\" \"That happened in [my] daughter's bed. In her beach house.\" Mr Babonneau remembers Mrs Pelicot's sustained indignation, but noted too that she never cried, and that with the help of experts, she'd managed \"to put an impressive distance between what she was seeing and her mental health.\" The lawyers saw this moment as a \"final test\" that showed their client had regained \"some kind of equilibrium\" in the four years since 4 November 2020, when she'd been informed about her husband's actions and \"her world was destroyed.\" She was now ready to face the rigours of a public trial.\n\nMrs Pelicot had wanted to watch the footage in order to understand who all these men were, and to help fill in the gaps in her memory, caused by the years of being drugged by her husband. \"She has entire pieces of her existence that don't exist in her mind,\" explained Mr Babonneau. The same practical concerns first shaped her decision to opt for a public trial, and to push for the videos to be shown in open court. She was beyond angry, for sure. But at that stage she wasn't looking to change the world. She was simply nervous about the idea of spending months inside a closed courtroom packed with dozens of her abusers. A public trial would, she thought, feel less intimidating. The first day of the trial was still traumatic. Sunglasses on, Mrs Pelicot was revealing herself in public for the very first time. And it got worse. Walking beside her up the steps towards the courth", "continuation": "ouse, Mr Babonneau noticed and recognised some of the accused men, in masks. But Mrs Pelicot only slowly became aware that she was now surrounded by them, elbows bumping as they jostled to get through the same security barriers. \"It was stressful for her. She was surprised how casual everything seemed to be,\" recalled Mr Babonneau. And then came the moment – the first in four years – when Gisèle and Dominique Pelicot's eyes met across the crowded courtroom. Their chairs were arranged as if to make such contact unavoidable. \"I saw sometimes that they exchanged looks,\" Mr Babonneau noted. Gisèle had spoken repeatedly to her team of her concern about how she might react in that first encounter.\n\nWe know now, of course, that while giving evidence in court Dominique Pelicot confessed to everything and that he begged his family for forgiveness. We also know that Gisèle Pelicot has not forgiven him. \"For sure, no. She cannot forgive him,\" said Mr Babonneau. And yet, the couple were once deeply in love. They were married for fifty years. And in the courtroom, Mr Babonneau could tell, the former couple were not able to ignore their shared past entirely. So, what did the lawyer see in those glances they exchanged? It was like they were saying \"look at us,\" said Mr Babonneau. He felt they were communicating to each other a shared sense of disbelief. Almost as if they were, briefly, spectators watching the agonies of two strangers. \"How did we end up here?\"\n\nDuring the trial, defence lawyers for various accused men tried to suggest that Gisèle's composure, her lack of tears, somehow implied that she was complicit in her own abuse. Or that she felt sympathy for Dominique Pelicot. \"When a victim doesn't cry, or cries too much, there is always something to criticise,\" said Mr Babonneau, with a flicker of contempt. But while the attacks clearly rattled Mrs Pelicot, she also told her legal team not to worry. There was a simple reason for that. Nothing that the lawyers could throw at her in court could ever compare with the very worst moment of her life, that day in November 2020, when an officer had sat her down at Carpentras Police Station and showed her the first grim images that investigators had extracted from her husband's hard drive. \"You know I survived 2 November 2020, so I'm ready for everything now,\" Babonneau remembers her saying.\n\nAs the trial went on, Gisèle Pelicot was surprised to find that public and media interest was not drifting away, as she and her team had imagined it would. Instead, she began receiving letters and gifts and applause from cheering crowds. \"When she started receiving these letters, she felt some kind of responsibility for victims who had suffered similar things,\" said Babonneau. She came to understand the uniqueness of her case – that the video evidence meant it was not simply \"the word of the victim against the word of the suspect\", and that she now had a rare opportunity \"to change society\". \"I'm lucky to have the evidence. I have the proof, which is very rare. So, I have to go through [all this] to stand for all the victims,\" she told Mr Babonneau. Her lawyer noticed, again, his client's \"simple,\" practical nature. She has no interest in being \"an activist\", but is simply thinking of how her experience of being drugged without realising it, could now help make other women aware of the issue, and look out for possible signs of similar abuse. Had she known then what all of France knows now, perhaps she could have put an end to her ordeal. And maybe other women can now do the same.\n\nAs for the future, Mrs Pelicot may, perhaps, break her silence with a few interviews in the months ahead. But she's made it clear she wants \"to remain an individual… she wants to live a very simple life.\" And while she may never forgive her once \"perfect\" ex-husband, she has found a way to manage her memories of him and to cling on to the \"happy moments\" they once shared. Some psychiatrists argue that Dominique Pelicot is a relatively typical psychopath – a high-functioning narcissist with no capacity for empathy who weaved between his sordid hidden life and the self-gratifying role of playing of a family man. Gisèle Pelicot sees things more simply, embracing the idea, put forward at the trial, of a split personality. As Mr Babonneau puts it, \"there were two men in Dominique Pelicot and she only knew one of them.\"\n\nIf you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line."}

{"context": "Historic writer's desk could be 'knackered' old fake\n\nMuseum visitors will be asked whether they believe the piece of furniture really was Dr Johnson's desk\n\nThe desk of the writer Dr Samuel Johnson is to be returned to his former London home for the first time in more than 260 years. Except, in a strange twist, its owner is now uncertain whether it really is the desk of the famous 18th Century dictionary author. It's been suggested that despite many years of being treated as a literary relic, it could have been part of a Victorian hustle to make money. It will be the star attraction of a new museum exhibition, but visitors will be asked whether they now believe it's authentic.\n\nThe plaque records the desk being given to the Oxford college in 1867\n\nDr Samuel Johnson was an 18th Century literary giant, remembered for compiling in 1755 what was then the most comprehensive dictionary of the English language. In the TV comedy Blackadder the Third, Dr Johnson was portrayed by Robbie Coltrane, with the painstakingly researched dictionary ending up on the fire. What's now in dispute is the fate of the desk on which he wrote the dictionary when he was living in Gough Square, in a house which is now a museum to his memory. Since the 19th Century the wooden desk has been in Pembroke College Oxford - and the college is lending this prized possession to the Dr Johnson House museum. But when Lynda Mugglestone, professor of the history of English at the college, began to check out the provenance of the desk, there were some unexpected questions. \"The real story is that we don't quite know if it's the real desk,\" she says.\n\nThe desk will be on show at the Dr Johnson House in London\n\nIt had come to the college through a clergyman who had been close to Dr Johnson's god daughter, Elizabeth Ann Lowe, and her sister. A plaque was attached to signify its historic importance. But the puzzle is whether those sisters ever really had the desk or whether they used their literary connection as a way of guilt-tripping some famous writers of their era for money. Prof Mugglestone says that as the centenary of Johnson's dictionary was being marked in 1855, the Lowe sisters began writing asking for cash, describing themselves as in penury and with nothing left but a desk which they said had been left to them by the great writer. They were \"living in poverty\" in Deptford in south London, says Prof Mugglestone, and they made clear that \"donations were welcome\". Writers such as Thomas Carlyle and Charles Dickens, who had just written Hard Times, began to fund raise for the sisters. Literary London was mobilised to help the sisters who were the surviving connections to Dr Johnson. The desk became part of that story.\n\nDr Johnson's House, where he wrote his dictionary, is now a museum\n\nDickens wrote of the sisters being in \"great poverty, but undemonstrative and uncomplaining, though very old - with nothing to speak of in the wide world, but the plain fir desk on which Johnson wrote his English Dictionary\". Such pleas from Dickens helped to raise large donations for the sisters, with the desk being saved as a \"proud possession to the English nation\". But Celine Luppo McDaid, director of the Dr Johnson House, says it is now seems unclear whether this desk was actually Johnson's. The case for it being authentic, she says, is that the sisters could have been thinking: \"We've sold everything else, but we still have this treasured desk, it's the last thing we have.\" Or else it might have been a chance to turn a bit of spare furniture into a financial lifeline. \"They might have seen an opportunity and decided that the knackered old desk in the corner was 'Johnson's desk',\" says the museum director Ms McDaid.\n\nProf Lynda Mugglestone has researched the history of the desk\n\nProf Mugglestone says women in this era could be extremely financially vulnerable, with few ways to support themselves and such attempts to get money from rich connections might have been their only chance. The Lowe sisters did have a link with Johnson through their father, an impecunious painter Mauritius Lowe, who had lost a grant from the Royal Academy after some rather murky \"misconduct\". Ms McDaid says the painter and his children were living in \"abject poverty\" and Johnson, often broke himself, was sympathetic and helped them with money. But the so far unanswerable question is whether the Lowe family really ended up with the famous desk and had kept it for more than 70 years after Johnson's death. It's from the right era, but is it the actual desk? Researching the desk's origins revealed records of other petitions for money by Elizabeth Ann Lowe and her sister, essentially begging letters - with st", "continuation": "ories that were not always consistent. The prime minister and the royals were among those getting requests for support. \"She is lying to someone,\" says Prof Mugglestone. But that doesn't ultimately prove either way the authenticity of the desk.\n\nThe desk will be in Dr Johnson's former home in Gough Square\n\nThe exhibition will have to embrace this ambiguity and accept that even though this has been seen as Johnson's desk for generations, it might not be. Visitors to the exhibition next month will be asked to give their views on whether it was the desk where Dr Johnson's dictionary was written. \"I'd love it to be authentic,\" says Ms McDaid. \"Nothing is more evocative than a writer's desk... But there's no way we'll know.\" The exhibition, Desks, Drudgery and the Dictionary: Samuel Johnson’s Garret Lexicography, opens on 3 July at Dr Johnson's House, 17 Gough Square, London EC4A 3DE"}

{"context": "Robert Fico made his first statement since the assassination attempt in a Facebook video\n\nThree weeks after Robert Fico was gunned down in central Slovakia, he’s made a full-throated return to political life - on the eve of the European elections. In a Facebook video apparently recorded at home in Bratislava, the Slovak prime minister laid the blame for the attack on Slovakia’s liberal opposition, the \"anti-government media\" and foreign-funded NGOs for creating a climate of hatred and intolerance that made the shooting possible. Mr Fico, who was critically injured on 15 May after being shot multiple times in the abdomen, said he forgave his attacker - identified by prosecutors as 71-year-old Juraj C – and bore no hatred towards him. However, he said his assailant was an “activist of the Slovak opposition”. The man, who faces a lengthy prison sentence for attempted murder, was a “messenger of the evil and political hatred” whipped up by Slovakia’s “unsuccessful and frustrated” opposition, Mr Fico said. Opposition parties - in particular the liberal Progressive Slovakia, which is neck-and-neck with Mr Fico’s left-populist Smer party ahead of the European Parliament elections - have condemned the shooting and have categorically rejected all links with the attacker. Mr Fico, who has served as prime minister for more than 10 of the last 18 years, returned to power last October at the head of a populist-nationalist coalition. Slovakia has become ", "continuation": "increasingly polarised in recent months and the attack has only deepened tensions.\n\nThe suspect in Mr Fico's shooting was arrested after the incident in the town of Handlova on 15 May\n\nIn a video evidently recorded in the corridor of a police station hours after the attack in the central town of Handlova, the suspect – described as a poet and author - said he had been motivated by opposition to Mr Fico’s policies, including the abolition of public broadcaster RTVS. Footage also emerged showing him at several anti-government demonstrations. However, older videos showed the man addressing a meeting of a far-right Slovak paramilitary organisation, so there is lingering confusion over his political beliefs. Mr Fico, appearing well and dressed in a crisp white and blue patterned shirt, said if all went well he would be able to return to work at the end of June. He appealed to the \"anti-government media\" - especially those outlets he said were co-owned by companies linked to US philanthropist George Soros as well as foreign-funded NGOs and the opposition - not to downplay the reasons for the assassination attempt. He had warned for months, he said, that the likelihood of an attack on a government official was “approaching certainty\". The attack had taken place, he said, in an atmosphere where the opposition was exploiting the fact that the collective West was trying to force through a “single acceptable foreign policy”, notably on Ukraine, and riding roughshod over smaller nations that were trying to embark on a sovereign path of their own. Mr Fico opposes military aid to Kyiv and says Vladimir Putin has been \"wrongly demonised\" by the West. The opposition’s “violent or hateful excesses” against a democratically-elected government had been met with silence by international organisations, he said, simply because opposition views were in line with Western policy on Ukraine. This was the atmosphere in which the assassination attempt had taken place, he said. “I should be full of anger, hatred and revenge,” Mr Fico said. “[But] I would like to express my belief that all the pain I have gone through and am still going through will serve something good.\""}

On 6 June 1944, tens of thousands of soldiers landed on five beaches in Normandy, northern France. The largest amphibious invasion in the history of warfare played a crucial role in the defeat of Nazi Germany and the liberation of Europe.\n\nThe sixth of June is a date etched in the memories of generations as D-Day, when mainly US, British and Canadian forces combined to break Germany's hold.\n\nAt Gold Beach in Arromanches, Normandy, Major Trevor Macey-Lillie, piper with the Scottish gunners, enacted a time-honoured tradition of playing a Scottish lament on the bagpipes. The tradition recreates the exact moment thousands of British troops disembarked onto French beaches.\n\nPeople gathered early to attend the event at Gold Beach. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke at the UK commemorative event at the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\n\"80 years ago, the weather broke,\" he said, beginning his address, \"and the greatest invasion force in history left the shores of Britain to liberate Europe.\" Mr Sunak went on to say we \"pledge never to forget\" what people sacrificed in the D-Day landings, adding that veterans have dedicated their lives to telling others what happened.\n\nKing Charles III and Queen Camilla were welcomed by British cadets and French primary schoolchildren as they arrived for the Royal British Legion's commemorative event. They joined a number of Western leaders, including US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, to mark the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nThe King addressed veterans at the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer, saying allies had faced the \"supreme test\" 80 years ago and we are fortunate the D-Day generation did not flinch when \"the moment came to face that test\".\n\nIt is the first time the memorial, which contains the names of the 22,442 servicemen and women under British command who fell on D-Day and during the Battle of Normandy in the summer of 1944, has been used for major anniversary commemorations, having been opened in 2021.\n\nKing Charles III laid a wreath at the British Normandy Memorial, with a note attached touching on the sacrifices made on D-Day. French President Macron and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak followed, laying wreaths at the event to mark the anniversary.\n\nPresident Macron awarded 104-year-old British World War II veteran, Christian Lamb, the insignia of Knight in the Legion of Honour. Wren officer Christian Lamb, a veteran officer in the Women's Royal Naval Service, helped plan the D-Day landings from Winston Churchill's secret war rooms in London.\n\nThe Prince of Wales attended the Canadian commemorative ceremony to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day, at the Juno Beach Centre at Courseulles-sur-Mer. Prince William was greeted by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and France's Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, before speaking to veterans including Richard Rohmer, 100, one of the most decorated Canadian veterans.\n\nPrince William, the Prince of Wales, delivered a speech during the Canadian commemorative ceremony at the Juno Beach Centre near the village of Courseulles-sur-Mer.\n\nThe Prince thanked Canadian veterans for their \"extraordinary acts of bravery and sacrifice\". \"We continue to honour every Canadian, who gave so much, every Canadian family who lost a loved one,\" he said.\n\nHe ended his speech by saying in French: \"Thank you for our freedom, and thank you for your service.\"\n\nCanadian veteran Jim Spenst spoke to other veterans before the commemorative ceremony at the Canadian cemetery, which included a descent by Canadian paratroopers near the village of Courseulles-sur-Mer.\n\nThe US President and First Lady Jill Biden met World War Two veterans at the Normandy American Cemetery in Colleville-Sur-Mer.\n\nThey were greeted by a military fly-past as they arrived for the D-Day memorial ceremony at Omaha Beach, with French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte.\n\nThey handed the Légion d’honneur, France’s highest medal of honour, to surviving veterans, ahead of President Biden's speech.\n\nFollowing an address from US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, President Biden spoke of the climate in the lead-up to D-Day, and remembered the millions of Jewish people murdered in the Holocaust, and the millions of others killed in \"bloody warfare\".

The Scottish Government published an energy strategy last year outlining plans for a consultation on a \"presumption against\" any new oil and gas exploration. On the election campaign trail in Inverness, the first minister was repeatedly asked if his government would avoid adopting this policy. Mr Swinney refused to confirm, saying that the issue was \"complex\". The SNP leader also told BBC Scotland News that he wanted to have a \"manageable\" and \"orderly\" transition to net zero.\n\nThe future of the North Sea oil and gas industry has been a regular topic of debate during the general election campaign. Labour say they would help create to 69,000 jobs supported by a new publicly-owned energy company, but refuse to approve any new north sea licences. The Conservatives favour new exploration licences, saying both the SNP and Labour would fail to protect the industry. The Scottish Lib Dems said both the Scottish and UK governments have failed to make progress on a fair transition away from fossil fuels. Mr Swinney also echoed comments made by his deputy first minister Kate Forbes last week. She told BBC's Question Time programme that the party would consider new licences to drill in the North Sea on a \"case-by-case\" basis. Mr Swinney added that future applications for oil and gas licenses must be considered \"rationally\".

She said: \"There are 100,000 people whose jobs are dependent in one way or another on us getting the just transition right and us moving to cleaner energy. \"We have to focus on making sure the north east of Scotland doesn’t become another industrial desert in the way the west of Scotland did after shipbuilding died and we allowed to happen in central Scotland with mining.\""}

{"context": "Truong My Lan, pictured in court on Tuesday, could still avoid execution\n\nVietnamese property tycoon Truong My Lan has lost her appeal against her death sentence for masterminding the world’s biggest bank fraud. The 68-year-old is now in a race for her life because the law in Vietnam states that if she can pay back 75% of what she took, her sentence will be commuted to life imprisonment. In April the trial court found that Truong My Lan had secretly controlled Saigon Commercial Bank, the country’s fifth biggest lender, and taken out loans and cash over more than 10 years through a web of shell companies, amounting to a total of $44bn (£34.5bn). Of that prosecutors say $27bn was misappropriated, and $12bn was judged to have been embezzled, the most serious financial crime for which she was sentenced to death. It was a rare and shocking verdict - she is one of very few women in Vietnam to be sentenced to death for a white collar crime. On Tuesday, the court said there was no basis to reduce Truong My Lan's death sentence. However, she could still avoid execution if she returns $9bn, three-quarters of the $12bn she embezzled. It's not her final appeal and she can still petition the president for amnesty. During her trial Truong My Lan was sometimes defiant, but in the recent hearings for her appeal against the sentence she was more contrite. She said she was embarrassed to have been such a drain on the state, and that her only thought was to pay back what she had taken.\n\nTruong My Lan was sentenced to death earlier this year\n\nBorn into a Sino-Vietnamese family in Ho Chi Minh City, Truong My Lan started as a market stall vendor, selling cosmetics with her mother. She began buying land and property after the Communist Party introduced economic reform in 1986. By the 1990s, she owned a large portfolio of hotels and restaurants. When she was convicted and sentenced in April, she was the chairwoman of a prominent real estate firm, Van Thinh Phat Group. It was a dramatic moment in the \"Blazing Furnaces\" anti-corruption campaign led by then-Communist Party Secretary-General, Nguyen Phu Trong. All of the remaining 85 defendants were convicted. Four were sentenced to life in jail, while the rest -including Truong My Lan's husband and niece - were given prison terms ranging from 20 years to three years suspended. The State Bank of Vietnam is believed to have spent many billions of dollars recapitalising Saigon Commercial Bank to prevent a wider banking panic. The prosecutors argued that her crimes were \"huge and without precedent\" and did not justify leniency. Truong My Lan’s lawyers said she was working as fast as she could to find the $9bn needed. But cashing in her assets has proven difficult. Some are luxury properties in Ho Chi Minh City which could, in theory, be sold quite quickly. Others are in the form of shares or stakes in other businesses or property projects. In all the state has identified more than a thousand different assets linked to the fraud. These have been frozen by the authorities for now. The BBC understands the tycoon has also reached out to friends to raise loans for her to help reach the target.\n\nTruong My Lan defrauded Saigon Commercial Bank, one of Vietnam's biggest lenders\n\nHer lawyers have argued for leniency from the judges on financial grounds. They said that while she is under sentence of death it would be hard for her t", "continuation": "o negotiate the best price for selling her assets and investments, and so harder for her to raise $9bn. She could do much better if under a life sentence instead, they say. “The total value of her holdings actually exceeds the required compensation amount,” lawyer Nguyen Huy Thiep told the BBC before her appeal was rejected. “However, these require time and effort to sell, as many of the assets are real estate and take time to liquidate. Truong My Lan hopes the court can create the most favourable conditions for her to continue making compensation.” Few had expected the judges to be moved by these arguments. She is now, in effect, in a race with the executioner to raise the funds she needs. Vietnam treats the death penalty as a state secret. The government does not publish how many people are on death row, though human rights groups say there are more than 1,000 and that Vietnam is one of the world’s biggest executioners. Typically there are long delays, often many years before sentences are carried out, although prisoners are given very little notice. If Truong My Lan can recover the $9bn before that happens, her life will most likely be spared."}

They are damning statistics for Pep Guardiola, even if he does have some mitigating circumstances with injuries to Ederson, Nathan Ake and Ruben Dias - who all missed the loss at Villa Park - and the long-term loss of midfield powerhouse Rodri. Guardiola was happy with Saturday's performance, despite defeat in Birmingham, but there is little solace to take at slipping further out of the title race. He may have needed to field a half-fit Manuel Akanji and John Stones at Villa Park but that does not account for City looking a shadow of their former selves. That does not justify the error Josko Gvardiol made to gift Jhon Duran a golden chance inside the first 20 seconds, or £100m man Jack Grealish again failing to have an impact on a game. There may be legitimate reasons for City's drop off, whether that be injuries, mental fatigue or just simply a team coming to the end of its lifecycle, but their form, which has plunged off a cliff edge, would have been unthinkable as they strolled to a fourth straight title last season. \"The worrying thing is the number of goals conceded,\" said ex-England captain Alan Shearer on BBC Match of the Day. \"The number of times they were opened up because of the lack of protection and legs in midfield was staggering. There are so many things that are wrong at this moment in time.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Man City 'have to find a way' to return to form - Guardiola\n\nAfterwards Guardiola was calm, so much so it was difficult to hear him in the news conference, a contrast to the frustrated figure he cut on the touchline. He said: \"It depends on us. The solution is bring the players back. We have just one central defender fit, that is difficult. We are going to try next game - another opportunity and we don't think much further than that. \"Of course there are more reasons. We concede the goals we don't concede in the past, we [don't] score the goals we score in the past. Football is not just one reason. There are a lot of little factors. \"Last season we won the Premier League, but we came here and lost. We have to think positive and I have incredible trust in the guys. Some of them have incredible pride and desire to do it. We have to find a way, step by step, sooner or later to find a way back.\" Villa boss Unai Emery highlighted City's frailties, saying he felt Villa could seize on the visitors' lack of belief. \"Manchester City are a little bit under the confidence they have normally,\" he said. \"The second half was different, we dominated and we scored. Through those circumstances they were feeling worse than even in the first half.\"\n\nErling Haaland had one touch in the Villa box\n\nThere are chinks in the armour never seen before at City under Guardiola and Erling Haaland conceded belief within the squad is low. He told TNT after the game: \"Of course, [confidence levels are] not the best. We know how important confidence is and you can see that it affects every human being. That is how it is, we have to continue and stay positive even though it is difficult.\" Haaland, with 76 goals in 83 Premier League appearances since joining City from Borussia Dortmund in 2022, had one shot and one touch in the Villa box. His 18 touches in the whole game were the lowest of all starting players and he has been self critical, despite scoring 13 goals in the top flight this season. Over City's last eight games he has netted just twice though, but Guardiola refused to criticise his star striker. He said: \"Without him we will be even worse but I like the players feeling that way. I don't agree with Erling. He needs to have the balls delivered in the right spots but he will fight for the next one.\""}

{"context": "Cavan Medlock launched himself at a member of staff after being refused entry to meet a solicitor\n\nA Nazi sympathiser has been found by a court to have prepared a terrorism attack on an immigration law firm after choosing them as a target after reading a Daily Mail article. Cavan Medlock carried a Nazi flag and a knife into a London solicitors' offices in 2020 and then launched an attack on staff. The attack caused so much alarm that senior lawyers lobbied the then home secretary, Dame Priti Patel, to reconsider some of the language she and others were using, claiming that it was adding to tensions. Leaders in the profession say the incident has led to continuing concern as extreme right-wing groups single out lawyers for abuse and threats.\n\nCavan Medlock said he chose target after reading about the solicitor in the Daily Mail\n\nDuring his police interview, Medlock said he had chosen the firm and its immigration chief as targets after they had been named in a Daily Mail article three days earlier. The finding at Kingston Crown Court on Tuesday was not a criminal conviction - but a conclusion by a jury of factually what happened. A trial of the facts occurs in rare circumstances when a defendant is not well enough to either admit or deny a charge, but a case needs to be concluded. An attempt to put Medlock on trial in March was aborted after he suffered an episode of very serious mental ill health. The jury found he had committed the acts of preparing for an act of terrorism and making threats to kill when he stormed into the offices of law firm Duncan Lewis. A senior judge will decide on Thursday how best to manage Medlock's detention for public protection because he is too mentally unwell to be in a prison.\n\nStaff subdued and disarmed Medlock and then surrounded him until the police arrived\n\nThat incident happened on 7 September 2020 when the then 27-year-old Medlock walked into the firm, which has a specialist immigration law team who handle some of the most complex cases in the country. Medlock repeatedly asked to see the firm's head of immigration law - but after about 15 minutes of waiting, he pulled out a six-inch knife and lunged at a receptionist. The member of staff succeeded in disarming Medlock, who was ultimately overwhelmed and subdued by other staff who rushed to the scene. Medlock then declared that he had come to kill the senior lawyer he had been asking for and used racially offensive language against other members of staff. When one of them identified herself as Jewish, Medlock expressed support for Hitler and the Holocaust. Police later found a Swastika flag in his bag - and his interview confirmed an ideological motive that fitted the legal definition of terrorism. At the time Medlock was not diagnosed with any mental ill health condition and he was assessed by a nurse as fit to speak to officers.\n\nMedlock planned to fly this flag in the law firm's front window\n\nIn his police interview, he told detectives that he had wanted to stop the firm helping immigrants by taking its immigration chief captive. He then planned to put the Nazi flag, and another relating to the US's slave era states, in the firm's window as a \"rallying cry to other nationalists\". \"When politics fails and the people have no alternative, I think violence is the only natural progression of that thinking to get change,\" he told officers, warning that there was a \"white genocide\" under way. \"Boris Johnson, he's not going to do anything about mass immigration,\" he said. \"How many times have the Conservatives promised to bring the immigration [level] to 100,000 a year, and failed?\"\n\nMedlock told police in his interview that he was carrying this to intimidate\n\nTimothy Cray KC, prosecuting, told Kingston Crown Court: \"He ", "continuation": "was admitting carrying out acts of preparation for terrorism. His brand of terrorism was clear. \"By his own admission, at the time of the attacks, he identified as a Nazi. We say that plan was designed to intimidate a section of the public. \"Can you imagine the [media] coverage? A solicitor held hostage, or perhaps worse, and the Nazi flag flying in London. \"Perhaps we can console ourselves with the fact that he would not have had many takers.\"\n\nDuring his police interview, Medlock said he had chosen the firm and its immigration chief as targets after they had been named in a Daily Mail article three days earlier. \"I first saw his name on [The] Daily Mail, a couple of days ago,\" said Medlock. \"And then when I Googled his name and I found out he has his office right here... I was like, you know, these people, they can't just continue to flood Europe with people nobody wants here and get away with it.\" Medlock's phone history confirmed he had read the article which referred to \"UK lawyers who coach asylum seekers\" to avoid deportation. A spokesman for the Mail said: \"The Mail gives no support to terrorists, whatever their politics. \"The article referenced in this case was a legitimate piece of investigative journalism in the public interest, and the law firm involved was quoted so their view would be represented. \"We welcome the fact that the mentally-unwell person who planned this terrorist incident is facing justice.\"\n\nThat article came after sources in Boris Johnson's government had been briefing some journalists for weeks that \"activist lawyers\" had been holding up some deportations, the court heard. The phrase was used publicly a week before the attack in a video posted on the Home Office's account on Twitter, now known as X. The department's top civil servant then banned it from the government's PR releases. But Dame Priti Patel, then home secretary, used the phrase in her own tweet the day before the Mail's article - but she did not publicly mention Duncan Lewis or any other firm.\n\nThe Bar Council, the professional body for barristers in England and Wales, condemned the language and at the time called on her and Boris Johnson to \"stop deliberately inflammatory language towards a profession simply doing its job\". Mr Johnson had made separate comments deriding human rights lawyers in his October 2020 party conference speech, but did not refer to Duncan Lewis or immigration cases. Sam Townend KC, the council's current president, said that it had continued to warn of anti-lawyer rhetoric and it hoped a page had now been turned - but the profession's concerns remain exceptionally high. Richard Atkinson, the president of the Law Society, which represents solicitors, said: \"The attack on Duncan Lewis solicitors was the first example of a worrying new trend. \"This eventually led to threatened attacks on 39 law firms and advice agencies during this summer's riots. \"Many lawyers have faced deaths threats and have had to seek police protection. Until recently, this was unheard of in our country. \"This trend did not emerge from nowhere. It was closely associated with a degraded debate led by senior parliamentarians and sections of the media, largely focused on the immigration and asylum system. \"Words have consequences, particularly when they come from people in positions of seniority and power. They can legitimise hate, encourage division, and have serious repercussions.\" Dame Priti Patel has been contacted for comment."}

{"context": "PM 'not aware' of other Tory candidates linked to betting inquiry\n\nRishi Sunak has said he is \"not aware of any other\" Conservative election candidates being investigated by the Gambling Commission over alleged bets on the date of the general election. He has confirmed that his party is carrying out its own internal inquiries \"in parallel\" with the Gambling Commission's investigation. The commission has not said who it is investigating but so far the names of four Conservatives have emerged - including two who are standing for election. Mr Sunak has come under pressure from opposition parties, as well as some in his own party, to suspend the two candidates. Conservative Tobias Ellwood said the story was \"deeply unhelpful\" and that the public wanted to see \"robust action\". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: \"Rishi Sunak needs to show some leadership. If these were my candidates, I tell you what - they'd be gone. Their feet wouldn't have touched the floor.\" He dismissed the Conservative Party's internal inquiry as being \"designed for one purpose, which is to knock this in the long grass to the other side of the election\". Defending the PM, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris told the BBC people were not \"guilty until they're proven innocent\" and that the regulators should be allowed to \"get on with\" the investigation.\n\nThe allegations of gambling on the election date first emerged earlier this month against Craig Williams - one of the prime minister's closest aides, who reportedly placed a £100 bet on a July polling day three days before the date was named. Mr Williams - who is standing for the Conservatives in Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr - told the BBC he had made a \"huge error of judgement\" but refused to say if he had placed a bet on the basis of inside information. If someone uses confidential information to gain an unfair advantage when betting, this could be a criminal offence under section 42 of the Gambling Act. Laura Saunders, the Conservative candidate for Bristol North West, and her partner Tony Lee, the Conservative director of campaigning, are also under investigation, as is Nick Mason, the party's chief data officer. Mr Mason's spokesperson said he denied wrongdoing. Both Mr Mason and Mr Lee have taken leaves of absence from their party role's. The BBC understands the Gambling Commission's inquiries involve more people than those publicly named so far and other people linked to the party of the government are being looked into. Speaking to reporters in Edinburgh, Mr Sunak said he did not have the details of the Gambling Commission's investigation but that his party was conducting its own \"internal inquiries\". He added he would \"act on any relevant findings\" and pass on information to the commission. He also confirmed that he was not under investigation himself and that he had never placed a bet on politics whilst an MP. On Monday evening, the prime minister was again pressed on the subject by the Sun newspaper's political editor Harry Cole and whether he could simply question those he told about the election date before it was announced. Mr Sunak said he did not want to \"compromise the integrity\" of other investigations but added: \"I have been crystal clear - if anyone has broken the rules they should not just face the full consequences of the law but they will be booted out of the Conservative Party.\" Earlier in the day, Mr Ellwood, a Conservative candidate in Bournemouth East, said the scandal had been \"deeply unhelpful\". Asked if Mr Sunak should withdraw Conservative support from Mr Williams and Ms Saunders, Mr Ellwood said: “Given the scale of this as we", "continuation": " see now, and the potential for this story to continue to eclipse, to overshadow the election, I would now agree. \"The public want to see clear robust action now.\" Conservative peer and former minister Jo Johnson told BBC's Newsnight there was \"immense frustration\" amongst Tory candidates and activists that the story was still \"rumbling on\" because \"Number 10 hasn't managed to get to the bottom of it\". He called for the PM to take \"firm action\". \"Clearly no one can understand why people haven’t been suspended where in comparable situations others might have been,\" he added. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"I do think the Conservative Party could do far more. \"It feels to me like, as has been so often the case during this Parliament, they seem to be in it for themselves, not for the public service.\" On Sunday, Labour's election coordinator Pat McFadden wrote to the Gambling Commission urging it to \"make public the names of other figures\" under investigation. In a reply seen by the BBC, Andrew Rhodes, the regulator's chief executive, said: \"We understand the desire for information, however, to protect the integrity of the investigation and to ensure a fair and just outcome, we are unable to comment on any details at this time, including the name of any person who may be under suspicion.\"\n\nYou can find a full list of candidates for the Bournemouth East, Bristol North West, Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr constituencies on the BBC News website."}

A judge there ruled the council had acted unlawfully by not considering the family's needs properly and said it should have offered them an \"exceptional needs referral panel\". Following the judgement, Hounslow Council reconsidered the application, and in February ruled that the family were entitled to a four-bedroom property. Since then, the family has been shown a three-bedroom property, which they said they felt was not suitable and would not accommodate a hospital bed. They were supported by a Hounslow Council's occupational therapist report which said: \"The housing OT does not recommend the property to be suitable for the family\".\n\nHounslow Council has now told the family they must review their decision to refuse this property before they can move forward.

{"context": "Evan Gershkovich in court as spy trial starts in Russia\n\nEvan Gershkovich is accused of espionage and could face up to 20 years in prison\n\nFor nearly fifteen months, Evan Gershkovich has been locked away in a Moscow jail. Today the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reporter went on trial a thousand miles from the Russian capital in Yekaterinburg: the city where he was arrested on espionage charges while on a reporting trip for the Wall Street Journal. We were among the group of media allowed into a courtroom to see him before the start of proceedings at the Sverdlovsk Regional Courthouse. Head shaven, and wearing a check shirt and jeans, Mr Gershkovich stood in the metal and glass cage known in Russian courtrooms as \"the aquarium\". He smiled to cameras, but made no comment. After a few minutes we were asked to leave the room. From this point on this trial will be held behind closed doors. Prosecutors claim that the American journalist had been collecting classified information about a Russian tank manufacturer near Yekaterinburg on behalf of America’s Central Intelligence Agency. Mr Gershkovich, his employer and the US government vehemently reject the charge. If convicted the maximum possible sentence is 20 years in prison. The White House said Russia was using Mr Gershkovich as a \"bargaining chip\". \"Evan is not a spy,\" National Security Spokesman John Kirby said. “This is a bogus process. It’s outrageous and outlandish,” believes Deborah Ball, deputy world coverage chief for Europe, Middle East and Africa at the Wall Street Journal. “[Evan] will not enjoy any of the due process that we would expect in any Western court. It will be closed door. It will be secret. “Russia’s acquittal rate is less than one percent. We don’t expect any chance of him being acquitted.” In a statement on Wednesday, the journalist's family called the past 15 months \"extraordinarily painful\". \"We’re deeply disappointed that he will have to endure further attempts to discredit him and to paint a picture that is unrecognisable to anyone who knows him,\" they said. On the streets of Yekaterinburg, there is little hint of the drama that unfolded here on 29 March 2023. Russians stroll past the steakhouse where Evan Gershkovich was detained by Russian security agents. Across town people sit outside playing chess, as trams rumble by. The WSJ has accused Moscow of “stockpiling Americans” in Russian jails to be traded for Russians imprisoned abroad.\n\nThe list of US citizens currently in prison in Russia includes former marine Paul Whelan. In 2020 he was convicted of espionage and sentenced to 16 years in a penal colony. Last year, Alsu Kurmasheva - a journalist with Prague-based Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) - was", "continuation": " arrested in Russia. Ms Kurmasheva holds American and Russian passports. On a trip home to visit her ailing mother, she was detained. She was charged with spreading “false information” about the Russian armed forces over a book she had helped to edit which contains criticism of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. If convicted, she could face up to 15 years in prison. Among the other Americans behind bars in Russia are:\n• None Mark Fogel, a former teacher at the Anglo-American School of Moscow, which has now closed. He is serving a 14-year sentence for drug smuggling after 17g of marijuana were found in his luggage at Moscow airport. He claims he was using the drug for medical purposes\n• None Gordon Black, a US staff sergeant, sentenced by a court in Vladivostok to three years and nine months in a penal colony on charges of theft and threatening to kill his girlfriend. When he has spoken publicly about the case of Mr Gershkovich, Russian President Vladimir Putin has indicated he is open to the idea of a prisoner swap. There have been contacts between the US and Russia. But whom does the Kremlin want in exchange? President Putin has not named names. But he has dropped a strong hint. When asked about Mr Gershkovich a few months ago, the Russian president alluded to the case of Vadim Krasikov. Believed to be a Russian agent, Mr Krasikov is currently serving a life sentence for murder in Germany. “It’s evident that this is hostage diplomacy,” says Deborah Ball. “The Russians have been perfectly plain about what their objective is. Putin has barely hidden the fact that he wants to trade Evan and regards him as a pawn. He’s a political hostage.” The Kremlin knows that America makes deals to get its citizens back. In 2022, the US authorities released a convicted Russians arms dealer, Viktor Bout, to secure freedom for Brittney Griner. The American basketball star had been jailed in Russia on drug charges. Now an American journalist is in the dock. The Kremlin declined to comment on talks over a possible prisoner swap deal with the US. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that he could not go into detail and that the topic should not be publicly discussed. \"The investigation is under way, the trial is under way, so here we just need to wait for the verdict that will be delivered,\" he said. It is unclear how long the trial of Evan Gershkovich will last and how much longer the US reporter will be in a Russian prison. “It’s impossible for us to read this. We just don’t know, we’re shooting in the dark,” says Ms Ball. “The Russians regard this process, this sham trial, as part of some process they envision. Where it fits into what happens next, we have absolutely no idea.”"}
{"context": "'Everything is so hard' - Amorim searches for answers at Man Utd\n\nManchester United have won just two of six Premier League games under Amorim\n\nCould life at Manchester United get any more dispiriting? They have just lost 3-0 at home to \"little\" Bournemouth, as described by Cherries owner Bill Foley, for the second season running, a result that means they will spend Christmas 13th in the table. It is the first time they have been in the bottom half at this stage since the pre-Premier League days. Their fans – who booed Ruben Amorim's team off at the final whistle – are so upset at the imposition of a ticket price rise to a flat £66 with no concessions that they are joining forces with fellow supporters at bitter rivals Liverpool to protest when the two sides meet at Anfield on 5 January. Just as Amorim was telling the media he felt fans were \"tired\" in his post-match press conference, a leak from the ceiling led to water running onto journalists on the front row, forcing one of them to move. While many fans will be quite happy to learn of journalists covering their club getting a soaking, as a public farce it takes some beating. But for Amorim, United's position is no laughing matter. Defender Lisandro Martinez told Match of the Day the on-field situation makes him \"angry\". His boss has to find some answers. \"In this moment, everything is so hard,\" said Amorim. \"At a club like Manchester United, to lose 3-0 at home, it's really tough for everybody. \"Of course the fans are really disappointed and tired. You can feel it in the stadium in the first play. At the first goal-kick with Andre Onana, he's thinking what to do and pushing the other guys and everybody is so anxious. \"I understand that, but we have to face it.\"\n\nRuben Amorim has overseen three defeats in his six Premier League games so far\n\nIf there is a significant difference introduced by the Portuguese in the short time since he replaced Erik ten Hag last month, it is that United have more control in matches. Their possession stats are high, with 60% today. United had more shots and more shots on target than Bournemouth. But they lost, badly, again. For only the second time in their history - the other being against Burnley in the 1960s - they have lost successive home games against the same opposition by a three-goal margin. It would help significantly if they didn't keep conceding goals at set-pieces. It happened twice at Arsenal earlier this month and against Nottingham Forest in their last home game. At Tottenham on Thursday, Son Heung-min scored direct from a corner. Bournemouth managed it in the first half, even though manager Andoni Iraola admitted afterwards his is \"not a tall team\". Nevertheless, when Ryan Christie floated over a free-kick from the right touchline, teenage defender Dean Huijsen easily shrugged off the attentions of Joshua Zirkzee and flicked a header into the far corner. They were not all under Amorim's watch, clearly, but United have now conceded 17 goals from set-pieces in the Premier League in 2024, their most in a single calendar year in the competition. The recent mishaps do beg the question, what is set piece coach Carlos Fernandes, who accompanied Amorim from Sporting, actually doing?\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Amorim 'always expected' Man Utd job to be difficult.\n\nNot that Amorim is apportioning blame. \"The responsibility is on me, not Carlos,\" he said. \"We are a team in good moments and bad moments. We have a way of doing things. We are working on that and we are going to im", "continuation": "prove on that. But we didn't lose because of set pieces. We lost because we create more chances and didn't score.\" Speaking to Match of the Day, Martinez put it rather more bluntly. \"We are so angry with this kind of situation,\" said the Argentina defender. \"We have to work on set-pieces especially. \"I believe a lot in this team and staff. If they don't score their first goal from a set-piece then it is a totally different game.\" Amorim is hampered by a lack of quality. The Portuguese trusted Tyrell Malacia with the left wing-back role, but took the Dutchman off at half-time having watched him give the ball away too cheaply on too many occasions and not really offer anything going forward. Diogo Dalot switched sides, but his one goal threat lacked conviction. Noussair Mazraoui moved to left wing-back from his position in a three-man defence, but was drawn into the rash tackle on Justin Kluivert which allowed the forward to double Bournemouth's lead from the penalty spot. Further forward, only skipper Bruno Fernandes was a danger to the Bournemouth goal, with Marcus Rashford omitted for the third successive game, although he was at Old Trafford to watch the sorry events unfold. \"It depends, we will see,\" said Amorim when asked if the England forward might come into contention for the Boxing Day trip to Wolves."}

{"context": "The Scottish Greens have launched their 2024 election manifesto, in which they promise to \"turbo charge\" Scotland's journey to net zero with a call to invest £28bn a year in tackling climate change. The document, external sets out the party's plans if it was to form a government. Here are some of their key policies, analysed by BBC Scotland correspondents.\n\nIt's probably no surprise that the Scottish Greens go the furthest of all the main parties when it comes to their position on oil and gas exploration. Not only do they want the next UK government to end new licences, they also want to see recently issued ones revoked. That would be a costly business because companies will have already invested millions as licence holders and so will demand compensation, probably through the courts. The manifesto quotes the International Energy Agency which says new fossil fuel production must end now if global climate change targets are to be met. The", "continuation": "y also want to see an end to all subsidies and tax breaks for the fossil fuels sector which would overturn very long standing agreements on how the expensive job of decommissioning the North Sea will be paid for. The industry has contributed billions to the economy since the start of the oil boom in the 1960s and the understanding was that they'd receive these tax breaks in return for the clean up. The party wants to see Scotland at the heart of a clean energy revolution but says expensive new nuclear power must be ruled out of the mix.\n\nThe Scottish Greens are long-time backers of independence – and their manifesto includes the call for the powers to hold constitutional referendums to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Their argument mirrors that of the SNP, namely that it should be up to Scots to decide when to have another vote. So far, calls for a second referendum have been denied, and Labour has been clear it doesn’t support one. With backing for independence hovering around 50%, the Greens say they recognise there’s more work to do to persuade voters of their case. And in the meantime, the party wants more devolution, including full control over taxation, and greater borrowing powers for the Scottish government. The Greens say those powers would provide the opportunity to demonstrate how things can be done differently. They also want to remove the UK government’s veto over Holyrood legislation, after the mechanism was used by the Scottish Secretary to prevent a new system of gender recognition being enacted in Scotland. The Scottish Greens were big supporters of that policy – and moves to block it have fuelled their argument that Holyrood has been treated with contempt.\n\nThe Scottish Greens don't pretend that they would be able to influence health policy in Scotland through the results of this UK general election. But they say their overarching goal of Scottish independence offers a route to \"powers to protect our right to care from the NHS\". They say that in an independent Scotland, the Greens would ensure a written constitution could offer the legal right to free healthcare, including hospital treatment, mental health services, dentistry and eyecare. But past experience of legal guarantees to healthcare in Scotland have not proved enough to make it a reality. Since 2011, the Scottish government's treatment time guarantee has set out a legal obligation for health boards to provide inpatient and day case treatment for patients within 12 weeks of diagnosis. But in the latest quarterly statistics, only 56.7% of those patients had actually been seen within this timeframe. The Scottish Greens might argue that in an independent nation, the government would have more levers of control to make this a possibility. But putting something down in writing does not instantly provide the funding and the staff to make it happen overnight.\n\nFor the first time, Scottish Greens can set out what they've done in government as well as what they would like Westminster to do next. It gives their manifesto a sharper edge, or perhaps it just reads that way after having seen Scottish Green ministers at work. This is no longer the politics of wishful thinking. The party's programme for Westminster, however, remains that of a pressure group seeking opposition seats inside the Commons, with plans that don't have to add up. They would, however, combine to bring radical change, and unabashedly so. This plants the party firmly on the left of politics, in case there was any doubt, with nationalisation of buses to broadband to Loganair's island air services. There's intervention in the economy, to cap food prices while inflation rides high, to introduce a universal basic income, a scrappage scheme for boillers and cars while reinstating dates for ending their sale, and lowering the Bank of England lending rate for green investments. This puts Scottish Greens close to trade unions on ideas for stronger worker rights, parental and compassionate leave, and a four-day week with no loss of pay. On tax, the target is wealth, with a tax on those with assets worth more than £3.4m, ranging from 1% up to 10% per year, bringing in an estimated £70bn. As with the SNP, it's proposed that UK income tax should match Scotland’s higher rates and more thresholds. At least one Green proposal is likely to be considered by the next Westminster government, even if bigger parties won't admit it now: a system for charging drivers per mile for use of the road, to replace fuel duty revenue as petrol and diesel is extinguished.\n\nThe Scottish Greens argue drugs possession should be decriminalised by the UK government and/or that the policy be devolved to Holyrood, so Scottish ministers have the power to change the law themselves. The Greens say a change in drugs laws would ease the introduction of safe consumption rooms and drug checking services. These checking services already operate in countries including Canada and allow individuals to submit drug samples for analysis and get individual feedback. The aim is to reduce the harm of street drugs which have increasingly unknown strengths, but in the UK the services require licences issued by the Home Office. The Greens suggest the current legal framework acts as a barrier. Drugs policy is currently reserved to Westminster. Health is devolved though and some would argue there are improvements in healthcare which the Scottish government could make within its existing powers.\n\nThe Scottish Greens – like the SNP – want to devolve broadcasting to the Scottish parliament. But they would go further, establishing a Scottish media authority and legislation which would monitor social media as well as mainstream output. That monitoring would extend to hate speech, with the potential to ban advertising which “promotes hate speech or undermines democracy.” They support the continuation of the licence fee in funding the BBC, but believe it needs to be reviewed in a fast-changing media landscape. They want to see the expansion of the Local Democracy Reporting scheme, which is operated by the BBC, to support local newspapers and give more space to community voices. They’d also like to introduce a levy on paid streaming services - with incentives for those who invest in content production in Scotland. They also want to ensure that nationally important events like football and the Eurovision Song Contest are available on free to air services."}

Albatross parents share incubation duties and, once the chick hatches, feeding duties. Wisdom was first identified and tagged in 1956 after laying an egg.

Dominique Pelicot, 72, was found guilty of all charges by a judge in Avignon, southern France, and cried in court as he was sentenced to the maximum term. He was on trial with 50 other men, all of whom were found guilty of at least one charge, although their jail terms were less than what prosecutors had demanded. Ms Pelicot and her children looked emotionless as the verdicts were read out, occasionally glancing at the defendants and resting their heads against the wall.\n\nThe convictions brought an end to France's largest ever rape trial, which over the course of three months has shocked the country and the world. On Thursday morning, police shut the road opposite the courthouse to accommodate hundreds of people who turned up to offer their support to Ms Pelicot. A large banner reading \"Thank you Gisèle\" was spread across a wa", "continuation": "ll facing the entrance. Underneath it, several members of the public chanted \"rapist, we see you\" as defendants trickled in ahead of the trial.\n\nOne of the defendants arrives at the court in Avignon, wearing a hood and a facemask to hide his identity\n\nSpeaking outside of the court following the verdicts, Ms Pelicot said the trial had been a \"very difficult ordeal\". Her grandson, who is in his late teens, was standing next to her for the first time, his arm over her shoulder as she addressed the media. Her voice faltered only once as said she \"never regretted\" her decision to make the trial public \"so society could see what was happening\". The 72-year-old's decision to waive her automatic right to anonymity was highly unusual. She attended almost every day of the trial, appearing in the same courtroom as her husband of 50 years, who she has now divorced. French and global media followed the case with growing interest and hundreds of journalists were present in court on Thursday. As Ms Pelicot spoke, hundreds of people chanted her name and sang feminist songs. She gave her \"profound\" thanks to her supporters and said she had \"confidence\" in there being a \"better future\" where men and women can live in \"mutual respect\".\n\nThe Big Cases: My Husband the Monster The shocking story of Gisele Pelicot, raped by strangers her husband invited to abuse her.\n\nSupporters gathered outside court holding signs that read \"shame swaps sides\" - alluding to something Gisèle said in court\n\nMs Pelicot's ex-husband Dominique Pelicot - who had already confessed to his crimes - was found guilty of aggravated rape. He was also found guilty of the attempted aggravated rape of the wife of one of his co-accused, Jean-Pierre Maréchal. Maréchal - who was described as Dominique's \"disciple\" as he drugged and raped his own wife for years and invited Dominque to do the same - was jailed for 12 years. Dominique Pelicot was also found guilty of taking indecent images of his daughter, Caroline Darian, and his daughters-in-law, Aurore and Celine. Caroline - who was in court on Thursday - previously told the trial she felt she was the \"forgotten victim\" as, unlike in her mother's case, there was no record of the abuse she is convinced was inflicted on her. \"I will never come see you and you will die alone like a dog,\" she shouted at him in court in November. After the verdicts were delivered, Dominique Pelicot's lawyer said her client was \"somewhat dazed\" by his sentence and would consider whether to appeal. He has 10 days to decide whether to do so. Dominique Pelicot stood accused alongside 50 other men, 46 of whom were found guilty of rape, two of attempted rape and two of sexual assault. Several of them have already spent years in jail as they were arrested when police conducted their initial investigation in 2021, and will therefore be free relatively soon. Most of the men on trial had denied that what they did was rape. They argued they did not realise Ms Pelicot was unconscious and therefore did not \"know\" they were raping her. It is an argument that sparked a nationwide discussion about France's legal definition of rape. The defendants' jail terms range from between three and 15 years. In a statement to AFP news agency, the Pelicot children said they were \"disappointed\" by the \"low sentences\".\n\nFor almost a decade from 2011, Dominique Pelicot drugged his now ex-wife and raped her, and recruited dozens of men online to have sex with her while she was unconscious. His crimes were discovered in 2020, when police arrested him over a separate charge of filming up the skirts of women in a supermarket. Police seized his devices and found thousands of videos on his laptop, with evidence of around 200 rapes. Investigators used the videos to track down his co-accused, although they were unable to identify an additional 21 men.\n\nThe couple's daughter Caroline Darian arriving at the courthouse, followed by her two brothers\n\nThe trial sparked a discussion about whether the issue of consent should be added to France's legal definition of rape, as it has been in other European countries. Rape in France is currently defined as \"any act of sexual penetration committed against another person by violence, constraint, threat or surprise\", meaning prosecutors must prove intent to rape. Many of the defendants argued they did not realise Ms Pelicot had not consented, claiming they were \"tricked\" by Dominique Pelicot, and believed they were going to the couple's house for a threesome involving a fantasy that the woman would be asleep. The trial also shone a light on the issue of chemical submission, or drug-induced sexual assault. Most of the 50 men came from towns and villages in a 50km (30 mile) radius of the Pelicots' home village of Mazan. They included firefighters, lorry drivers, soldiers, a journalist and a DJ and were described by defence lawyers as being \"ordinary people\", earning them the nickname Monsieur-Tout-Le-Monde (Mr Everyman). The trial also brought sexual violence against women into the spotlight in France, with many praising Ms Pelicot for her bravery in opening up the case to the public. She previously said she was determined to make \"shame change sides\" from the victim to the rapist. It is a phrase that has been repeated by her supporters. But Ms Pelicot has been clear that behind her facade of strength \"lies a field of ruins\" and despite the widespread acclaim for what she has done, she is a reluctant hero. \"She keeps repeating, 'I am normal' - she does not want to be considered as an icon,\" her lawyer Stéphane Babonneau told the BBC. \"Women generally have a strength in them that they can't even imagine and that they have to trust themselves. That's her message.\"\n\nIf you have been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line."}
{"context": "Actress Holly Valance (left) was believed to be hosting the Republican event - with fashion icon Anna Wintour hosting the rival Democratic fundraiser\n\nThe US election campaign came to London on Wednesday evening, as an Aussie pop star and the editor of Vogue hosted rival fundraising events to reel in thousands of dollars in donations. Holly Valance, the former Neighbours actress who topped the pop charts in the early 2000s, hosted the pro-Donald Trump event in West London at which ticket prices started at $10,000 (£7,800), one guest told the BBC. Vogue’s editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, meanwhile, hosted a fundraiser in support of Joe Biden's campaign, a Biden campaign official confirmed. Tickets were said to have cost $1,000 each. Only US citizens and permanent residents were able to make donations. Donald Trump's son, Donald Jr, was among the guests at the Republican fundraiser. He said afterwards it had been “incredible” and had raised lots of money, CBS News reported. Asked about the Hunter Biden guilty verdict, he said it was a \"decoy to cover up all the actual corruption that was going on in that administration\". Trump's ally Nigel Farage, the Reform UK party leader, also attended the event. Boxer Derek Chisora was pictured arriving wearing a cap with Trump's \"make America great again\" sloga", "continuation": "n.

The most expensive tickets for one of Mr Biden's events in New York in March cost half a million dollars each.\n\nSpeaking before the fundraiser, Mr Swenson said he would be \"surprised\" if Trump Sr did not make a virtual appearance, having been at other events at which the ex-president \"chimes in\". The London location was near the Chelsea Embankment in an exclusive area. At the door, a man in a suit and umbrella welcomed guests dropped off in front of polished black gates on Wednesday. The property’s website describes the venue as a “hub for entertainment and relaxation”, including wine cellar, swimming pool, spa and IMAX cinema. Not everyone at the site felt warmly toward Trump, however - a woman with an American accent shouted “vote Biden” from a building nearby. Trump has lagged behind his rival in fundraising efforts during the race so far, but his recent conviction in a New York hush-money trial prompted donations of tens of millions of dollars, according to his campaign team. The party was \"killing it with small donations\", Mr Swenson said, after Americans were left \"shocked at the justice system\". Valance, 41, is perhaps better known to millions in Britain and Australia for her 2002 song Kiss Kiss, and its racy video that took the pop world by storm. She been linked to Mr Farage and Trump since being pictured alongside the two politicians in 2022, along with her entrepreneur husband Nick Candy. There was no immediate response to a BBC request for comment that was sent to the Candy Foundation, the couple's charity.\n\nFew details were available about the rival Democratic event hosted by Anna Wintour. The timing of the rival London events was pure coincidence, insisted Sharon Manitta, global press secretary for Democrats Abroad.

It is the first time the 53-year-old has spoken out since her husband, Sir Rod Stewart, publicly accused Wallace last month of being an \"ill-mannered bully\" who had \"humiliated\" his wife during her 2021 appearance on the show. Lancaster told ITV's Loose Women on Thursday: \"I didn't realise my husband had sent that post out until ", "continuation": "it was out\". Wallace stepped down from MasterChef two weeks ago while an investigation into the allegations of historic misconduct are under way.

You humiliated my wife when she was on the show, but you had that bit cut out didn't you? Lancaster - who made it to the quarter-finals of Celebrity MasterChef - told Loose Women: \"Without going into details, I didn't realise my husband had sent that post out until it was out and of course, you can imagine, the influx of inquiries there were.\" She said she was on jury duty at the time and didn't realise what had happened until later, saying she was \"in shock\" by Sir Rod's message. \"When I did turn my phone back on I got a message from a friend saying, 'Oh my God, how amazing was that message your husband put out!' And I was like 'What message? What has he done?'\" Speaking to the panel, Lancaster said: \"I most definitely was witness and victim to some of the bullying and harassment behaviour of Gregg Wallace, and unfortunately, a lot of those involved in the production team were also witness to that, and I really feel that he used his position of power to, I believe, intimidate and cause distress to a lot of people on set. \"And it's really unfortunate that someone like him is allowed to get away with that, and while others sort of stand by and let it happen at the same time.\" Lancaster added: \"I felt a little bit vindicated that something was put out there, going back to sort of that whole Me Too [movement], it's shocking to think how many women do suffer in the hands of... [men] in a powerful position and are too afraid to talk out. \"They don't feel at the time that they're going to be supported or listened to.

Production company Banijay UK announced an \"immediate, external review to fully and impartially investigate\" and has said that Wallace was \"committed to fully cooperating throughout the process\". Asked about Lancaster's specific allegations, Banijay says it \"takes this matter incredibly seriously but while the external investigation is ongoing, we won't be commenting on individual allegations\". \"It is important to note, that MasterChef welfare processes are regularly adapted and strengthened and there are clear protocols to support both crew and contributors. \"These include multiple ways of reporting issues, including anonymously.

Cars smashed and walls knocked down following Mayotte cyclone\n\nThe death toll from a cyclone which hit France's Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte on Saturday is likely to be several hundred, a local official has warned. Entire communities were flattened when Cyclone Chido made landfall, causing wind gusts of more than 225km/h (140mph). The last reported death toll stood at 11 but speaking to local media, the island's prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville said it will \"definitely be several hundred\" once the damage is fully assessed, adding it was possible that a \"few thousand people had died\". French President Emmanuel Macron earlier said France would \"be there\" for the people of Mayotte and was sending 250 rescue workers.\n\nDestruction in the aftermath of the cyclone that hit Mayotte on 15 December\n\nFrance's interior minister Bruno Retailleau said \"all makeshift homes have been completely destroyed\" and he feared a \"heavy\" death toll. On Saturday, one local news source reported, external that 11 people were killed and 246 injured, based on a hospital report. AFP had reported a higher death toll - at least 14 - citing a security source. Located north-west of Madagascar, Mayotte is an archipelago comprised of one main island, Grand-Terre, and several smaller ones. Most of the island's 300,000 or so inhabitants live in shacks with sheet metal roofs, and tens of thousands of people have lost their homes. Electricity, water and internet connections are all down.

The head of Mayotte's firefighters' union, Abdoul Karim Ahmed Allaoui, told the BFM news channel on Saturday morning that \"even emergency responders are locked down\".

Even buildings built to earthquake standards haven't held up. \"The emergency services command centre has been evacuated and is functioning at partial capacity.\"\n\nInterior Minister Retailleau wrote in a statement on X: \"I offer my full support to the people of Mayotte. The state and local emergency services are fully mobilized. 110 civil security personnel and firefighters have already been sent and are on site. A second dispatch will be made tomorrow with 140 additional personnel.\" French Prime Minister François Bayrou, who took up the post on Friday, said the cyclone was of \"exceptional severity\" and he was being updated on the situation \"hour by hour\". He has held an emergency meeting in Paris with ministers. Mayotte was initially placed under a purple alert - the highest level - and a \"strict lockdown for the whole population, including emergency services\" was imposed. It has since been lowered to red to allow emergency services to leave their bases. Retailleau said the island had not experienced such severe weather since 1934.\n\nAfter hitting Mayotte, the storm intensified overnight as it crossed the Mozambique Channel.

{"context": "Labour says it will make permanent a scheme designed to ensure low-deposit mortgages are available for first-time buyers, if it wins the general election. The mortgage guarantee scheme was introduced by the Conservatives in 2021 when Rishi Sunak was chancellor of the Exchequer. It was extended until July next year by current Chancellor Jeremy Hunt. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he wanted to \"turn the dream of owning a home into a reality\". The measure sees the government act as guarantor for part of a home loan – to encourage lenders to offer low-deposit deals. The Labour Party says its plan will help more than 80,000 young people get on to the housing ladder over the next five years. But according to the Office for National Statistics, external, some 40% of 16.5 million people aged 15 to 34 in the UK were living with their parents in 2022 - about 6.7 million people.\n\nLabour says making the scheme permanent will mean young people facing tough conditions in the private rented sector or struggling to save will not be \"locked out of homeownership\". It would be known as \"Freedom to Buy\", the party says. In a statement, Sir Keir said that Labour would be \"on the side of the builders, not the blockers\", announcing the plans around home ownership. The party leader said: \"A generation face becoming renters for life.\" \"My parents' home gave them security and was a foundation for our family. \"As prime minister, I will turn the dream of owning a home into a reality,\" he added. The existing scheme allows lenders to purchase a guarantee on part of mortgages, so if a bank decides to repossess a house, the government could compensate some of its losses. The Treasury has designed its existing programme \"to increase the appetite of mortgage lenders for high loan-to-value lending\" - so buyers face paying smaller deposits for their mortgage. Brokers have pointed out though that borrowers still have to pass checks to show they can afford mortgage repayments, not just raise a deposit. Mortgage providers may only lend to those with a sufficient regular income, irrespective of any government guarantee. This could just end up being a backstop as many lenders do not use the guarantee, as they are happy to offer deals with a 5% or 10% deposit in any case. As part of the plans announced on Thursday evening, the Labour Party also pledged to \"reintroduce housing targets\", fast-track planning permissions on brownfield land and prioritise \"grey belt\" building - moves which it claims could boost building by 1.5 million homes.\n\nFirst-time buyers were finding the housing market \"tough\" Guy Gittins, chief executive at estate agents Foxtons, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \"I don't think that's going to change in the immediate future,\" he said. He said any incoming government should try to encourage first-time buyers onto the ladder and with \"a little bit of sensible policy around the help-to-buy schemes\" that can happen. That also includes reviewing stamp duty, he said. New house price data showed that the average house price in the UK was £288,688 in May, according to mortgage lender Halifax. It said prices were \"largely static\" after edging down by 0.1% from April. But in the year to May, prices rose by 1.5%. In compiling its figures, Halifax looks at its own mortgage lending and does not include cash buyers or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales.\n\nDavid Sturrock, a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank said that big falls in homeownership during the 2000s meant young adults are now a third less likely to own their own home than they were 25 years ago. He said that making the current scheme permanent had the \"potential\" to reduce one of the barriers to getting on the housing ladder. \"Prospective buyers also need to have a sufficiently high income to take out a (bigger) mortgage and afford the repayments,\" he said. As a result, potential buyers in their 30s and from more well-off backgrounds looking to buy outside of London and south-east England were more likely to be able to take advantage of the offer, he suggested. For its part, the Conservative party is putting forwards its \"Family Home Tax Guarantee\". The Tories have pledged not to increase the number of council tax bands, carry out a council tax revaluation, cut council tax discounts or increase the rate or level of stamp duty which buyers pay when they purchase property. Laura Trott, Chi", "continuation": "ef Secretary to the Treasury, said: \"Only Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives have a clear plan, backed by bold action, to strengthen the economy, bring mortgage costs down and help more people get on the housing ladder.\" SNP candidate for Airdrie and Shotts, Anum Qaisar, said Scottish households were \"being punished by Westminster failures\", adding that \"the cost of mortgages and energy bills are too high and families need help now.\" The Liberal Democrats said they would \"put community need over developer greed, giving people the chance to get on the housing ladder with genuinely affordable houses.\""}

Following the incident the council said it had started remedial works to address the immediate issues. Despite knowledge of the tip's existence, residents said they were never told it had been categorised as a tip with the potential to affect public safety.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nFears over the safety of Wales' old coal tips first resurfaced in 2020 after a landslide above the village of Tylorstown in Rhondda Cynon Taf during Storm Dennis. A total of 2,573 disused coal tips were identified, with 360 classed as having \"the potential to impact public safety\" and requiring regular inspection. A review, commissioned by the Welsh government, found existing laws on tip safety - introduced in the wake of the Aberfan disaster in 1966 - no longer provided \"an effective management framework\", as they were designed for a time when there was an active coal industry. Work on a new bill has been under way for several years, with proposed legislation set to be introduced to the Senedd this week. If passed, it will lead to the establishment of a new organisation called The Disused Tips Authority for Wales which would take responsibility for \"the assessment, registration, monitoring and management\" of tips. With many tips now in private ownership, the new authority would have the power to require landowners to carry out repair work where necessary, with the threat of an unlimited fine if they do not comply. The government said grant funding would be available, with an appeals process too for landowners unable to cover the costs involved themselves.\n\nSince this landslide happened at Tylorstown in Rhondda Cynon Taf in 2020, the council has put infrastructure in place to make it safe.\n\nLocal authorities are largely responsible for coal tips which are on public land, while some are in the hands of the Mines Remediation Authority, formerly known as the UK Coal Authority. Robert Sullivan from the organisation said: \"Many of these sites were remediated in a period when climate change wasn't really considered and as a result, the Mining Remediation Authority is conducting a review of climate change adaptation of our sites which includes looking at what we can do to better manage these sites during periods of heavy rainfall. \"We're looking at the installation of remote smart monitoring such as rain gauges and we're also looking at what we can do in terms of flood alleviation. \"One of the key factors of tip management is the control of ground water and surface water, so we're trying to alleviate that problem without having created a detrimental impact on people.\"\n\nPhil Thomas, who runs a group which campaigns for coal tips to be cleared, says it's vital the responsibility for maintaining tips doesn't fall solely on the public purse\n\nOn a visit to Tylorstown to unveil the proposed new law, the Deputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies said the recent landslides \"illustrate the potential risks and concerns that disused tips present to people living in their shadow\". \"This bill is about keeping communities safe and is part of a wider programme of work to improve the safety of disused coal tips,\" he said. Plaid Cymru said legislation alone was \"not enough\" and called on the UK government to pay \"the full £600m estimate cost of remediating coal tips over the next decade\". The Welsh Conservatives welcomed the proposed bill and said they would be \"looking to ensure that more is done to stop damage from scramblers and 4x4 offroad vehicles, communities are involved in the decision-making process of making safe coal tips and that biodiversity is protected\".\n\nIf you follow the news in Wales you'll have probably seen the video many times. Shaky footage, hastily filmed on a phone of a hillside above the village of Tylorstown in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) giving way. \"Wow\" the man behind the camera gasps - echoing the sentiments of a nation. The landslide in 2020 reopened a painful scar on the Welsh psyche, and kickstarted a process - both practical and political - to shore up the country's old coal tips. It's hard to believe how little was known then about exactly how many there were, where they were located, who owned the land and what condition they were in. There's been a major effort in recent years to plug those knowledge gaps and today's announcement brings legal reforms and a new organisation to manage the situation in future. But questions remain over how to foot the bill for a long-term fix, with the leader of RCT council telling BBC News in October as much as £800m could be needed over the coming decades. Another discussion point is around the involvement of private firms offering to fund remediation work at certain tips by selling the coal they dig out as they go."}

Alistair Carns said a rate of casu", "continuation": "alties similar to that prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine would lead to the army being \"expended\" within six to 12 months. He said it illustrated the importance of having reserves in order to be able to fight in a \"war of scale\". Official figures show the army had 109,245 personnel on 1 October, including 25,814 volunteer reservists. Carns, a former Royal Marines colonel who is also a reservist, said Russia was suffering losses of around 1,500 soldiers, killed or wounded, a day.\n\n\"In a war of scale - not a limited intervention, but one similar to Ukraine - our army for example on the current casualty rates would be expended, as part of a broader multinational coalition, in six months to a year,\" he added. In a speech on reserves at the Royal United Services Institute defence think tank, external in London, Carns, the minister for veterans and people, said: \"That doesn't mean to say we need a bigger army, but it does mean we must be able to generate depth and mass rapidly in the event of a crisis. \"The reserves are critical, absolutely central, to that process. \"Without them we cannot generate mass, we cannot meet the plethora of defence tasks and challenges that we require, and we cannot seamlessly integrate the very best experts into the heart of our armed forces.”\n\nSpeaking separately at the same think tank, the head of the armed forces said it was important to note there was only a \"remote\" chance that Russia would launch a \"significant direct attack or invasion\" on the UK, or other Nato member. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin added that Russia \"knows the response would be overwhelming, whether conventional or nuclear\". But he added that it showed the need for nuclear deterrence to be \"kept strong and strengthened,\" warning that the world was entering a \"third nuclear age\" following the Cold War and subsequent period of disarmament. This new age would be defined by the \"almost total absence of the security architectures that went before,\" and more countries having nuclear weapons. He added that China's increasing nuclear weapons stockpile meant the United States could face a \"two-peer challenge\" from Beijing and Moscow, with both countries possessing significant arsenals. Army reservists serve in their spare time, getting paid to train outside their main jobs. Carns said the reality of wars such as the one being fought in Ukraine was that they were \"attritional in nature\". He also said the UK needed to \"catch up with Nato allies\" by placing a greater emphasis on its reserves. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said the UK's armed forces were \"amongst the best in the world and offer a 24/7 defence of the UK, operating alongside our allies and partners to prepare for any event\". “The Strategic Defence Review will look at the threats we face and the capabilities we need so that our Armed Forces are better ready to fight, more integrated and more innovative,\" they added. “Our Reserves are an essential and extremely valued element of the Armed Forces and the contributions they make to our resilience and our ability to call on additional personnel when required are vital.” Earlier, the prime minister's official spokesman said the Budget had \"invested billions of pounds into defence\".\n\nLast month, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff Lieutenant General Sir Rob Magowan told MPs on the Defence Select Committee: “If the British Army was asked to fight tonight, it would fight tonight. “I don’t think anybody in this room should be under any illusion that if the Russians invaded eastern Europe tonight, then we would meet them in that fight.” Earlier on Wednesday, Foreign Secretary David Lammy urged Nato's European members to step up their defence spending ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House. The US president-elect has accused European countries of relying on American taxpayers for their security. At a meeting of Nato's foreign ministers in Brussels, Lammy said \"the time to act is now\" - although the UK government has yet to set out its own plans for increasing its spending on defence to 2.5% of national output. He highlighted Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its involvement in conflicts around the world, including the Middle East. \"In the United Kingdom, we are at 2.3%, heading to 2.5% as soon as we can get there, and we urge all allies across the Nato family to get serious about defence spending. \"All of our populations require us to understand the tremendous security challenges that we are facing at this time,\" he added."}
{"context": "UK 'doesn't have enough builders' for Labour's 1.5m homes\n\nThe UK does not have enough construction workers to build the 1.5 million homes the government has promised, industry leaders have warned. Tens of thousands of new recruits are needed for bricklaying, groundworks and carpentry to get anywhere near the target, they told the BBC. The Home Builders Federation (HBF), along with the UK's largest housebuilder Barratt Redrow said skills shortages, ageing workers and Brexit were some of the factors behind the shrinking workforce. The government confirmed there was a \"dire shortage\" of construction workers but said it was \"taking steps to rectify\" the problem.\n\nLast week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer repeated the pledge he made soon after taking power to deliver 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029. And on Thursday he unveiled sweeping changes to the planning system and vowed to override \"blockers\" standing in the way of building the new homes. Labour hopes building more homes will reduce house prices and make buying and renting homes more affordable, especially for younger people. Its target means building an average of 300,000 new homes a year - in recent years the number has been about 220,000. The current workforce is estimated to be 2.67 million, according to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB). But for every 10,000 new homes to be built, the sector needs about 30,000 new recruits across 12 trades, according to the HBF, the trade body for the house building industry in England and Wales. Based on the government's plans, the estimated number of new workers required for some common trades, for example, would be: The HBF said while the industry had \"the capacity to deliver current build levels, tens of thousands of new people will need to be recruited if we are to reach the targets set out\". When asked if there were enough workers currently to build the extra homes, David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Redrow, said: \"The short answer is no.\" He told the BBC the government would have to \"revolutionise the market, revolutionise planning, revolutionise methods of production\" for their target to be met. \"They're challenging targets, I think we have to recognise that this is a national crisis,\" Mr Thomas said. But the HBF also said the UK \"does not have a sufficient talent pipeline\" of builders to employ. It cited several recruitment constraints, including a poor perception and lack of training within schools, not enough apprenticeships and the costs of taking on apprentices. The industry body admitted the sector itself had not \"attracted\" enough new recruits in recent years. All of these factors over time has resulted in an ageing workforce, with a quarter of workers being aged over 50, it said.\n\nBarratt Redrow boss Mr Thomas said recruitment had not been helped by a drive in past decades to encourage young people into further education rather than trades. \"If you went back to the 60s and 70s, I think parents, teachers, and the government were very happy with the idea that people became trades - electricians, plumbers, bricklayers,\" he said. The average rates of pay for these jobs \"are high\" but the issue was \"more about availability of labour with skills, he said. An experienced bricklayer can earn around £45,000 per year, while carpenters are paid about £38,000 and electricians £44,000, according to government figures.\n\nSkills shortages have been an issue in the UK for some time, but the gap had been partially plugged in recent decades with workers from the European Union - a recruitment pool which has dried up after freedom of movement ended as a result of Brexit. The HBF said 40 to 50% of skilled workers had also left the industry following the 2008 financial crash and \"restrictions\" had made it harder to recruit from overseas. Mr Thomas said historically the building sector had recruited a significant number of bricklayers from eastern EU countries, admitting that \"in hindsight\", the UK had been over-reliant on overseas workers but it had been the \"norm\". According to the industry's latest", "continuation": " census, Romania, India and Poland were the most common countries of origin for construction workers from overseas. More than half of London's construction workforce are EU/EEA nationals. Last month, the government announced £140m of funding to create 5,000 more construction apprenticeship places per year and established \"homebuilding skills hubs\" to fast-track training. A government spokesperson said the skills hubs showed it wanted to \"make sure this country takes skilled careers like construction seriously\". But ministers received a blow to its plans from local councils, charged with implementing the new targets in their areas, who said they were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\". The independent think tank Centre for Cities also estimated the housebuilders will fall 388,000 short of the government's 1.5m target. But both Barratt Redrow and the HBF have welcomed the government plans. The HBF said \"a more pro-development policy approach\" would enable the industry to \"invest in the people and land needed to increase housing supply\". Despite recruitment challenges, Barratt Redrow is planning to build between 16,600 and 17,200 in the next financial year, almost 4,000 more than what Barratt itself forecast, before the merger with Redrow in October."}

{"context": "Britain's longest-serving World War Two spy, Christine Granville, risked her life countless times carrying out missions across Europe, yet today her contribution is barely known. Who was she and why does the nation owe her such a great debt?\n\nOn 15 June 1952, Granville returned to the west London hotel she called home, her flight to Belgium having been cancelled due to engine failure.\n\nAfter making her way to her usual room on the first floor, she heard a man in the lobby shouting her name and demanding the return of some letters. Downstairs, she found herself faced by her former lover who suddenly thrust a commando knife into her chest, fatally wounding her.\n\nHaving survived many perilous situations on three different fronts during the course of World War Two, it was a bitter irony that she should lose her life in the apparent safety of a Kensington hotel.\n\nGranville worked for MI6 on several occasions in France, where agents had an average life-expectancy of only six weeks\n\nBorn in May 1908 as Maria Krystyna Janina Skarbek, she was the daughter of a Polish count and, through her mother, an heir to a Jewish banking family. She spent her early years running free on a grand country estate, a childhood that would profoundly influence her later life.\n\n\"She'd been brought up used to a lot of freedom and adoration, taught to ride a horse, shoot a shotgun, all that sort of thing,\" says historian Clare Mulley, who is the author of The Spy Who Loved, a biography of Christine Granville - the identity the agent assumed while working for the British.\n\nIn September 1939, she had been travelling in southern Africa with her second husband, a Polish diplomat, when they heard their homeland had been invaded by Nazi Germany. The couple headed straight to Britain to join the war effort.\n\nWhile her husband went on to France to join the Allied forces, Granville had a different plan as to how she could make a difference.\n\n\"She storms off to what's meant to be the secret headquarters of MI6,\" says Mulley. \"She doesn't so much volunteer as demand to be taken on.\"\n\nWhile in France, Granville spent time in Vassieux-en-Vercors, which faced heavy German bombing\n\nGranville submitted a plan to ski across the Carpathian Mountains into Nazi-occupied Poland, to take in Allied propaganda material and funds and bring back intelligence about the occupation.\n\nAs they had limited information about what was happening in Eastern Europe, it was a plan Britain's spy bosses liked and, according to Mulley, Granville was promptly signed up as MI6's first female recruit.\n\nOver the following years, the Polish exile became the stuff of legend in the intelligence community. \"She was this countess who had all of these connections to varying people in the know,\" Mulley explains.\n\n\"She spoke all the right languages... and she knew how to get in and out under the radar because when she'd been a rather bored countess - because she's a high-adrenalin woman - she used to smuggle cigarettes across the border skiing, just for kicks. She didn't even smoke.\"\n\nGranville arrived for one mission in France by parachuting from only 200m during gale-force winds\n\nDuring postings for MI6 in Hungary, Egypt and France, she would carry out missions, travelling across numerous borders, sometimes hidden in the boot of a car, sometimes while fleeing machine-gun fire, and often along with one of the many lovers she had during the war.\n\nOn one occasion, she received a microfilm that showed German forces lining up along the Soviet border for what looked like an imminent attack. It was passed on to Winston Churchill who, according to his daughter Sarah, would declare that Granville was his favourite agent.\n\nTwice she would be captured and interrogated by the Germans but was able to spring herself free. On one occasion, she convinced her captors she had tuberculosis by biting her tongue so hard she appeared to be hacking up blood.\n\n\"Her great tool is her brain. She's so quick-thinking; talks her way in and talks her way out. She's amazing,\" says Mulley.\n\nEven animals were seemingly unable to resist her charms. In her book, Mulley describes two occasions when Granville was able to turn a snarling guard dog kept by border patrols into her pet that would follow her beck and call.\n\nAlong with her quick wits and immense courage, Granville was a master of manipulation and persuasion.\n\nIn 1944, she climbed up to a German garrison based on a strategic pass in the Alps. Using a loudhailer, she convinced a group of 63 Polish officers forced into the German army to sabotage the military installations and desert, causing the garrison's commander to surrender.\n\nOn the sam", "continuation": "e day, she discovered her Special Operations Executive (SOE) commander - and lover - had been arrested in Digne in south-east France by the Gestapo, along with two other agents, and faced being executed by a firing squad.\n\nAt great risk to her own safety, she managed to free them all by storming into Digne Prison, claiming she was the niece of Field Marshal Montgomery and informing the officer in charge an American attack was imminent.\n\nMulley says: \"By the end of an hour she's basically terrified this guy, and she says, 'You know, if you go ahead with this execution I will make sure that you are strung up. If you do anything to me, you're going to be hanging from a lamppost, but if you help me, I will speak out for you.'\"\n\nFrancis Cammaerts, Granville's commander in France and lover, was one of three men she managed to get released from a Nazi prison\n\n\"There is a reason women were really useful in these [intelligence] roles,\" Mulley explains. \"The men were expected to be working, so able-bodied men walking around are very suspicious. But women are going everywhere because they're trying to keep the businesses going; they're looking after their families and their in-laws - she's undercover in plain sight.\"\n\nYet in spite of her heroism, come the end of the war, in Britain Granville would find the country for which she had repeatedly risked her life had seemingly abandoned her.\n\n\"The last entry in the British files that relates to her, and this is just a quote from it, it says 'she is no longer wanted',\" explains Mulley.\n\n\"Young men - some of them haven't even served in the war themselves - they just say, 'I doubt she did all this' and 'this little girl seems to be making things up' and 'she's very difficult to place'. It's very insulting, incredibly sexist stuff.\"\n\nThe Shelbourne Hotel in Kensington, where Granville lived in London, was run by the Polish Relief Society to provide cheap accommodation\n\nEven though Granville was unable to return to communist-controlled Poland because of the likelihood of her being targeted by the Soviet secret services, her temporary UK papers were not renewed and she had to leave Britain.\n\nGranville would return to the UK to refuse to accept a George Medal and OBE awarded to her for her war efforts, thereby shaming the government into finally offering her citizenship. She ended up accepting the awards.\n\nWhile living in the Shelbourne Hotel, she took on roles very different from her wartime escapades, waitressing in cafes and selling frocks in Harrods, before taking a job as a cleaner on a passenger ship.\n\n\"You have to remember that when she came to Britain to serve, she was with her diplomat husband at the start of the war and they arrive first class on a passenger ship, while at the end of the war, she's having to become a bathroom stewardess on the liners - but at least it gives her some sort of feeling of freedom,\" Mulley says.\n\nEven so, Granville would again experience discrimination when the ship's captain at one point requested his staff wear any medals they had earned during the war. Having served on three fronts, Granville had acquired numerous awards but was accused by her fellow workers of being a fake.\n\n\"She's a woman, so it seems absolutely ridiculous. She's got a foreign accent. She's quite dark-haired, looks a bit Jewish. You know all of these prejudices are stacked against her and she gets a really hard time,\" Mulley says.\n\nOne man, a fellow steward, did stand up for her - Dennis George Muldowney.\n\nThe pair started a relationship but Granville soon became bored by him. Spurned, an obsessive Muldowney continued to harass her until the night he murdered her in the Shelbourne Hotel.\n\n\"She came downstairs... then he just lunged at her and she cried out. She died within seconds of the impact; this blade had gone straight through her heart,\" Mulley says.\n\nThe World War Two agent is buried under the name Krystyna Skarbek-Granville at St Mary's Roman Catholic Cemetery in Kensal Green, north-west London\n\nMuldowney would be hanged 10 weeks later and, while the murder became front-page news, over the years Granville's story has faded from memory.\n\n\"She falls between every category, so no-one's blowing the trumpet for her,\" Mulley says.\n\n\"She's too much of an action person to be really feminine, and yet she's obviously too much of a woman to really be a male soldier. She's too English for the Poles to consider her Polish - she's never been recognised with an honour in Poland - and yet she's far too Polish for the Brits to really consider her truly British.\"\n\nMulley, who has been working to have Granville's achievements more widely recognised, successfully organised in 2020 for a blue plaque to be placed on Number 1 Lexham Gardens, which was once the Shelbourne Hotel and is still a hotel today. Mulley was also behind the creation of a Granville Suite at the luxury hotel The OWO, which opened in September in what was once the Old War Office in Whitehall.\n\n\"She's fallen between the lines and I think that's what's happened to her story as well,\" Mulley says. \"So I'm out there, solo championing her.\"\n\nClare Mulley's latest book Agent Zo tells the tale of Polish World War Two resistance fighter Elżbieta Zawacka and will be published in May.\n\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Janey Godley had asked family and friends to wear colourful outfits at the service\n\nComedian Janey Godley has been given a colourful comedy send-off in Glasgow, with Scotland's former first minister Nicola Sturgeon among the mourners. The funeral at St Mary's Cathedral in Glasgow saw many family and friends wear colourful outfits and ended with her catchphrase \"Frank, get the door\". The Scottish comedian died earlier this month at the age of 63, after receiving palliative treatment for ovarian cancer.

Storrie, 38, a comedian and radio presenter, said: \"My mum was very much a daughter of Glasgow, she loved her city dearly, it was her favourite place in the whole wide world. \"The emblem of Glasgow is the tree that never grew, and the bell that never rang, and the bird that never flew, and the fish that never swam, and I think she took that as a challenge. \"It felt like the world was telling her, be quiet, stay small, don't get big, so she did the opposite.\n\nGodley died after living for a number of years with ovarian cancer\n\nStorrie also thanked hundreds of mourners who lined the streets of Edinburgh on Friday, to see the hearse carrying Godley on her \"final tour\" ahead of the funeral.

The funeral ended with a recording of her saying, \"Frank, get the door\" before the church doors opened. Godley used the catchphrase to end each of her Nicola Sturgeon Covid parodies. It was also the title of her 2020 book.\n\nCrowds gathered in Glasgow to see Godley's hearse leave after the service\n\nHe said: \"It's no exaggeration to say that it's likely there are people alive today because of Janey Godley, because of funny wee videos, and because of the truth she told on stage. \"She kept them going through lockdown, and because people were able to make use of the advice that they were being given through what she said.\" Godley has said her Frank catchphrase was based on a man who read \"cowboy books\" at a pub she worked in. Born in the east end of Glasgow in 1961, Godley was a landlady before establishing herself on the comedy circuit. She became known to a wider audience across the world for her protest against Donald Trump's 2016 visit to Scotland, where she held up a sign with an offensive word describing the then president."}
{"context": "Private car parks in the UK are to offer motorists a 10-minute \"grace period\" before they impose a charge for overstaying. The measure was announced as part of a new code of practice companies have pledged to implement in the autumn. In", "continuation": "dustry trade bodies say the code will also introduce a fairer appeals system and maintain an existing cap on charges. Motoring organisations say the code \"falls far short\" of the standards required to protect \"innocent\" drivers from the \"sharks running private car parks\" and government legislation is required.\n\nThe code of practice, external was published by the British Parking Association and the International Parking Community, the two trade bodies representing private car park operators. It features requirements for a single set of rules for operators on private land, more consistent signage and an \"appeals charter\" for drivers. The introduction of a grace period means that every vehicle in a private car park will be given 10 minutes after the time paid for has expired before a parking charge notice is issued. The code maintains a cap on charges of £100, reduced to £60 if paid within 14 days. While the industry bodies say they would like the new code to be introduced by October, private parking companies are being permitted a \"period of transition\" and will only be required to \"fully\" meet the new standards by December 2026.\n\nPrivate car parks are managed by private companies and often found near supermarkets or out of town shopping complexes. They are different to public car parks run by local authorities in town centres, or near parks and open spaces. Private car parking companies issue charges when vehicles fall foul of their rules, which operate differently to those in place in public car parks. But private parking businesses have long been criticised by drivers, politicians and motorists' groups for confusing signage, unreasonable fees and aggressive debt collection. Private parking companies issued 9.7 million tickets to drivers in Britain between April and December last year, according to analysis of government data by the motoring research charity, the RAC Foundation. An attempted government crackdown on \"rogue\" operators foundered in 2022 following stiff opposition from private parking companies. A bill to enable the introduction of a legislation-backed code of conduct received Royal Assent in March 2019. This legislation - which should have come into force across Britain by the end of last year - included halving the cap on tickets for most parking breaches to £50, creating a fairer appeals system, and banning the use of aggressive language on tickets. But a legal challenge by private parking companies meant the government withdrew the legislation in June 2022. Mr Cousens said the code of practice was \"watered down\" and \"falls far short of the standards the AA, government and consumer groups have called for across many years\". He said: \"This self-authored code doesn't acknowledge the need to cap charges and remove debt recovery fees. \"These elements are desperately needed from a government-backed code to protect innocent drivers from the sharks running private car parks.\" Simon Williams, head of policy at RAC, said: \"Drivers shouldn't be fooled into thinking this so-called code developed by the private parking industry itself is the same as the long-delayed official private parking code of practice that is backed by legislation. \"This, and only this, will bring an end to the worst practices of some private parking operators and mean drivers - especially those who are vulnerable - are protected from unreasonable fines and debt collectors chasing down payments.\""}

The 23-year-old, from Edinburgh, started suffering from numbness and seizures in the build-up to the Olympics trials – where he missed out on qualification by a narrow margin. But tests carried out after the trials found three large oligodendrogliomas – a rare type of cancer which can affect the brain and spinal cord. The nature of the tumours makes surgery to remove the tumours impossible, with Goodburn now facing chemotherapy and radiotherapy to try and treat them. “Six weeks ago, my life experienced a profound change as I was diagnosed with three brain tumours,” he wrote on his Instagram. “In December 2023, my training began to be interrupted by strange episodes. These episodes, initially thought to be hemiplegic migraines, would occur during hard training. “They would leave me with a loss of strength and a numb sensation on my left side, a deep feeling of fear, nausea and extreme deja vu.

{"context": "Anne Mahrer and Rosmarie Wydler-Walti from Senior Women for Climate Protection won their climate case in April\n\nSwiss women who won a historic ruling on climate change at the European Court of Human Rights say they feel shocked and betrayed by their parliament’s decision not to comply with it. The women, known as \"climate seniors\", previously took their case to the court in Strasbourg, France, arguing the Swiss government’s inadequate response to climate change - and in particular extreme heat events linked to global warming - was damaging their right to health and life. The court agreed in April and ordered Switzerland, which has so far failed to meet is targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to do more. The court’s rulings are binding for member states, and this decision was unprecedented.\n\nClimate activists had hoped it would send a signal to other governments that human rights law could be used to defend citizens who believe their health is being harmed by worsening environmental factors. However Switzerland’s parliament voted on Wednesday to reject the ECHR’s ruling, suggesting it was not \"ignoring\" it, as some critics have claimed, but rather that Switzerland did not need to react as it already had an effective climate change strategy. The debate in parliament was at times emotional, with right-wing politicians criticising what they saw as an overreach by \"foreign judges\", and Green Party members describing the tone of the discussion as \"shameful\" and \"populist\". Switzerland is currently not on course to reach its Paris Climate Agreement goals – which seek to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – and opinion polls show many Swiss are worried about this. The Alpine climate is especially sensitive to global warming, and studies show that their glaciers, which are crucial to Europe’s water supply, could be gone by the end of the century if temperatures continue to rise. But the Swiss are also very proud of their system of direct democracy. They are used to making decisions themselves, and the \"foreign judges\" jibe resonates with them. Last weekend, voters backed government proposals to generate more electricity from renewables. Despite environmental groups’ claims that the measures", "continuation": " are still not enough to meet climate goals, opinion polls show a majority of voters reject the ECHR’s involvement, and think Switzerland is already doing enough to protect the environment. Other countries – notably the United Kingdom – will be looking closely at Switzerland’s rebuff of the rights court. The UK government's plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda has led to pushback from the Strasbourg court, and some British voters now say the UK should leave the body. In Switzerland, such a move is very definitely not on the cards – or not yet. Although parliament has suggested compliance with the ECHR's climate ruling is not necessary, the final decision on whether to abide by it is up to the Swiss government, which is expected to announce its verdict in August. The ECHR did not tell Switzerland exactly what it had to do to tackle climate change, it simply said it had to do more. It is possible that, in the good Swiss tradition of compromise, the government will offer the court in Strasbourg a list of all the measures it has taken since the climate seniors first started building their case, and hope that is accepted. If it is not, the Swiss climate seniors say they may return to court."}

The remains of the 13th Century Mortar Wreck were discovered in Poole Bay, off Dorset, in 2020. Cauldrons, cups, pottery and kitchen objects have already been brought to the surface. A team from Bournemouth University has returned to the site to raise the carved slabs, along with stone mortars - made for grinding flour.\n\nDr Derek Pitman, head of archaeology at the university, said the wreck was \"really well preserved\". \"It was full of stone mortars and burial slabs.

The Ryder Cup star, who only turned professional 12 months ago, carded a one-under 69 to leapfrog overnight leaders Patrick Cantlay and Rory McIlroy. Cantlay showed resilience in a rocky 71 to finish on four under, while Northern Ireland's McIlroy continued with his patient approach but bogeyed the last to shoot 72 and is one further back. France's Matthieu Pavon held the joint lead before bogeying his final two holes to end alongside McIlroy and American Tony Finau, who also dropped a shot at the last in a 69. In the morning wave, Bryson DeChambeau set the clubhouse lead at four under par. He was briefly overhauled by Belgium's Thomas Detry who managed six birdies but bogeyed two of his final three holes to join the American. Meanwhile, world number one and red-hot pre-tournament favourite Scottie Scheffler came perilously close to missing his first cut since August 2022 after a ragged round of 74 left him just the right side of the cut line on five over par. Italy's Francesco Molinari also made the cut with a sensational hole-in-one at the ninth - the second of the day after Austria's Sepp Straka also aced the same hole. The 2018 Open champion had bogeyed the eighth to be at seven over par but the eagle one was enough for him to make the weekend. However, despite some fine shots, 15-time major champion Tiger Woods is going home after a three-over 73 left him at seven over par.\n\nOver the past 50 years, only three players younger than 24-year-old Aberg have had at least a share of the 36-hole lead at the US Open: Jordan Spieth (21 in 2015 at Chambers Bay), McIlroy (22 in 2011 at Congressional) and Woods (24 years and 169 days in 2000 at Pebble Beach). All three went on to win. Aberg is playing in just his third major after finishing runner-up to Scheffler on his debut at the Masters in April. \"I think Augusta proved to me that I was able to be in that position, and it was more of a justification of, yeah, you can actually be there and contend on a Sunday,\" he said. This is his latest step in a sensational 12 months that has seen him win on the DP World Tour and PGA Tour before starring in Europe's Ryder Cup win over the US in Rome last September. And while he missed the cut at last month's US PGA Championship, his metronomic game of fairway, green, hole, repeat is working well in his first US Open. Pinehurst's Number Two course is regarded as one of the toughest in the world, featuring sandy scrubland off the fairways and treacherous greens with steep run-off areas. \"A US Open is supposed to be hard,\" said the Swede, who is trying to become the first player since 1913 to win this championship on debut. \"It's supposed to challenge any aspect of your game and I feel like it's really doing that.\"\n\nPatrick Cantlay had never previously led after a round at a major championship\n\nCantlay hung in on day two after a poor double bogey at the eighth and further bogeys at 12 and 16. Ranked sixth best on the PGA Tour this season for scores in the first round of tournaments, the American's record over rounds two through four is concerning. By far the best in the field around the greens on Thursday, his form dipped on Friday and given the upturned saucer putting surfaces, it will be a crucial metric for him to master if he is going to win his maiden major title.\n\nBryson DeChambeau won the 2020 US Open at Winged Foot by six shots\n\nEach of the past 16 men’s major winners have been within three of the lead after round two – and 26 of the past 28 US Opens – and there are eight players at two under par or better at the halfway stage. The 2020 US Open champion DeChambeau is one of them and is making a habit of contending at majors this year with a joint sixth at the Masters and second at last month's US PGA Championship. A helter-skelter display on Friday contained fine lengthy putts and passionate fist pumps to delight the huge crowds following his play. “I'm excited for the test and challenge,\" said DeChambeau who had five birdies and four bogeys in his 69. \"It's going to evolve, especially with the conditions being as hot as they are. If the wind picks up, it's going to be diabolical.\"\n\nMcIlroy is also once again in contention at a major. He has had five successive top-10s at the US Open, including last year's runner-up finish. He described Thursday's bogey-free opening as a “controlled round of golf” but seemed to be losing his grip when at two over par for his round on Friday, he putted straight off the green on the 17th (his eighth), only to hole the chip back to save par. That energised him around the turn and he finally found his first birdie with a seven-footer at the third to reward a magnificent approach into the green. \"I did a pretty good job at keeping some of the mistakes off the scorecard,\" said the four-time major winner. \"I am in a great position going into the weekend.\" He finished eight shots ahead of playing partner Scheffler who was off-colour in a bruising round of 74. This was his first birdie-free round of golf at a major tournament and there was even a minor outburst from the usually impassive world number one as he tossed his putter following a missed par attempt. An erratic display was summed up by a grisly double bogey at the fifth hole, a score matched by world number two Xander Schauffele who scrapped his way to a 69 and one under par total. The newly crowned US PGA champion was joined on that mark by Hatton who hauled himself into the top five before three bogeys in four holes on the back nine checked his progress. Aaron Rai is at three over, while fellow Englishmen Tommy Fleetwood and Matt Fitzpatrick, as well as Northern Ireland's Tom McKibbin, all made the cut on five over. However, Scotland's Robert MacIntyre and England's Justin Rose and Robert Rock are heading home after finishing at six over par.\n\nSepp Straka made his Ryder Cup debut for Europe in Rome last September\n\nSo far, with tournament organisers watering the course between rounds, the Pinehurst track has yet to fully bare its teeth. However, do not underestimate the mental challenge it poses - this course has hosted this championship three times before and only four players have finished under par. After his 71 on Friday, Hatton described what is happening in his head during a round as \"internally screaming for the most part\". The only bogey-free round of the day belonged to Japan's Hideki Matsuyama who shot a 66 to stay within touch of the leaders on two under. Finally, the topsy-turvy round of the day went to Straka, who had an unfortunate triple-bogey seven on the third after his ball hit the pin and ricocheted into a bunker. However, the Austrian was high-fiving everyone in sight after registering the tournament's first hole-in-one on the par-three ninth as he posted a 72 to fini", "continuation": "sh two over.

{"context": "North Korea is building sections of what appears to be a wall in several places near its border with South Korea, new satellite images reveal. Images analysed by BBC Verify also back up previous reports, external from South Korea that land inside the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) has been cleared, which experts say could be a violation of the long-standing truce between the North and South. The DMZ is a 4km (2.5 miles) wide buffer zone between North and South Korea, who are still technically at war having never signed a peace treaty. The DMZ is split in two, with each side controlled by the respective nations. This recent activity is “unusual”, according to experts, and comes at a time of rising tensions between the two countries. “At this point we can only speculate that North Korea is looking to strengthen its military presence and fortifications along the border,” says Shreyas Reddy, a correspondent at the specialist site NK News, based in Seoul.\n\nBBC Verify commissioned high-resolution satellite imagery of a 7km stretch of the border as part of a project to look at changes North Korea was making to the area. These images appear to show at least three sections where barriers have been erected near the DMZ, covering a total of about 1km close to the eastern end of the border. It’s possible that there has been further barrier construction along other stretches of the border. The exact date construction began is unclear due to a lack of previous high-resolution imagery in the area. However, these structures were not visible in an image captured in November 2023. “My personal assessment is that this is the first time they've ever built a barrier in the sense of separating places from each other,” Dr Uk Yang, a military and defence expert at Seoul’s Asan Institute for Policy Studies told the BBC.\n\n“Back in the 1990s, North Korea had set up the anti-tank walls to deter the advance of tanks in case war broke out. But recently, North Korea has been setting up walls 2-3m high, and they don't look like the anti-tank walls,” Dr Yang says. “The shape of the walls suggests that they are not just obstacles [for tanks], but are intended to divide an area,” adds Dr Yang, who reviewed the satellite images. There is also evidence of land clearance within the North Korean side of the DMZ.\n\nNK News published analysis, external based on satellite imagery taken on 4 June which shows a series of locations where land has apparently been cleared within the North Korean-controlled side of the DMZ. The high-resolution imagery obtained by BBC Verify shows one of these areas in greater detail, including what appears to be a newly created access road. In drawing the precise northern boundary of the DMZ in the map above, we have adopted the BBC’s research on border mapping. This is because there are slight variations in the available maps of the boundary. However, all the versions we’ve located show the land clearance taking place within the DMZ. An official from South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a recent briefing that the military had identified ongoing activity related to the “reinforcement of tactical roads, the laying of mines and the clearing of wasteland”. “The land clearing could be intended for both military and non-military aspects”, says Prof Kil Joo Ban of the Ilmin International Relations Institute, Korea University. \"It allows observatory posts to be easily established,\" he says \"for North Korea to monitor military activities in South Korea\" and to spot \"defectors who attempt to cross the border to South Korea.\"\n\nThe leaders of North Korea and South Korea last met in 2018\n\n“It is unusual to build structures in the DMZ and may be a violation of the armistice without prior consultation,” according to Prof Victor Cha, the senior vice president for Asia and Korea at at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. The Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice, in which both sides pledged not to \"execute any hostile act within, from, or against the demilitarised zone”. But there was no final peace settlement. While reunification has seemed unlikely for years, this had always been the stated goal of North Korean leaders until the start of 2024, when Kim Jong Un announced that his country would no longer pursue that ambition. Some experts called the remarks “unprecedented” and saw ", "continuation": "a significant policy change when Mr Kim labelled South Korea as a \"principal enemy\" at the beginning of this year. Since then, the North has also started to remove symbols representing the unity of the two countries - such as demolishing monuments and erasing references to reunification on government websites. “North Korea doesn’t really need more barriers to prevent a strike from the South but by erecting these border barriers, the North is signalling that it doesn’t seek reunification,” says Dr Ramon Pacheco Pardo, head of European and International Studies at Kings College London. Some experts also say this aligns with Mr Kim’s broader actions. “North Korea is not even pretending to want to negotiate with the United States or South Korea, and has rebuffed the recent attempts by Japan to engage in talks,” says Dr Edward Howell, Korean Peninsula researcher at Oxford. “With North Korea’s warming relations with Russia, we should not be surprised if inter-Korean provocations increase this year.” Clarification 24 June: This story has been amended to reflect previous reporting of border land clearance by NK News."}

The result is three-part BBC One drama Lost Boys and Fairies. The fictional tale inspired by his real-life experience is billed as a tender, glittering story of \"queer\" club performer Gabriel and his partner Andy’s journey to adoption.\n\nFilmed in and around Cardiff with some characters speaking both English and Welsh, the drama could not mean more to James, a Welsh speaker. \"It’s not only a queer story... it is a bilingual show on primetime BBC One,\" he said. \"That's a massive triumph not just for me personally but also for the BBC.\" Eight years ago James and his husband adopted two children under the age of six and have since adopted a third. \"When anyone becomes a parent their life changes drastically and dramatically, but when you're a parent to adopted children and two arrive at the same time and they have lived through early life trauma… it's parenting plus,” he said. James's mother had died less than a year before he became a parent and he found himself dealing with a wave of emotions. \"Even though I felt like I'd done my grieving, when you become a parent you suddenly see who your parents were through a completely different prism.\" For James, writing became a form of therapy. \"I thought it would make for a beautiful story but I also write in order to process my emotions and what I'm going through,\" he said.

To what extent is this James's experience? \"Everything I write is personally inspired… I've taken the themes of my life and the emotions of my life,\" said James, who grew up in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan. \"If I think of my life as a song with notes, structure and a rhythm, I've taken all those notes so the song sounds similar, but I swap them all around so that it is essentially still a work of fiction to protect myself and to protect my family and everyone around me as well.\"\n\nLost Boys & Fairies is James' first original screenplay for the BBC\n\nJames laughed as he remembered playing dress-up at nursery and being desperate to wear a beautiful pink dress. But as he got older, like the character Gabriel, his school years were overshadowed by a \"deep-rooted shame\". \"You're categorically told that the love that you feel towards people is wrong,\" he said. \"I was constantly made to feel that I was abnormal, that I was subhuman, that I didn't deserve to live and breathe and be, and that's an incredibly traumatic space to exist as a child and a teenager and to internalise all of those emotions.\" Between the ages of 11 and 13 he faced the \"horrific experience\" of daily bullying on the school bus. \"It was often a very lonely place in little Daf's head,\" he said. \"To keep myself sane I would sit and imagine stories in my head, like films where I was playing the lead part... it was only years and years later I've realised ‘what you were doing was writing your own stories, you were writing your own films'.\"\n\nThe couple's social worker Jackie (played by Elizabeth Berrington) assesses, supports and guides them through the adoption process\n\nJames said when he began writing the drama, his first original screenplay for the BBC, he was simply using his lived experiences and was not trying to create something that made a statement about the representation of LGBTQ+ people or the Welsh language. \"Although politically I do want to have this out there... representation is so, so important,\" he said. \"This drama is about inclusion and breaking down those binaries, shifting the world into somewhere more inclusive, where people can live and breathe and feel safe in their own identities.\" So how would young Daf on the school bus feel about having a three-part bilingual drama on BBC One inspired by his and his husband's journey to adopt? \"This show in particular has such personal and political and cultural resonance for me,\" said James. \"Little Daf would be dancing and singing his heart out with delight - in a lovely pink dress.\"\n• None All episodes of Lost Boys and Fairies are available on BBC iPlayer and it airs on BBC One weekly from from Monday 3 June at 21:00"}

{"context": "Heledd Roberts is one of the Welsh influencers encouraging people to dispose of their waste responsibly\n\nSocial media influencers have been brought in to tackle the problem of fly-tipping in Wales, which is at its highest for 15 years. Latest figures show 42,171 incidents dealt with by councils and Natural Resources Wales (NRW) in 2023-24, up 6% on the year before. This figure does not include private land. Fly-tipping Action Wales has focused on an influencer-led campaign to encourage people to dispose of their waste responsibly. \"It's a great way of being able to target a younger audience by using younger people to grab their attention,\" said Heledd Roberts, the daughter of a recycling centre owner and one of the group's content creators.\n\nShe added: \"Wales is known for its natural beauty, its amazing landscape. But if fly-tipping carries on this way, it won't be Wales as we know it.\" Heledd lives in Carmarthenshire where, despite an 18% drop on the year before, more than 3,000 fly-tipping incidents were recorded in 2023-2024. \"It's so destroying when you're driving home and you see all this rubbish on the side of the road.\"\n\nFly-tipping Action Wales, which is sponsored by the Welsh government and partnered with environment body NRW, hopes it will help councils that are spending money on clearance costs instead of \"vital services\". Team leader Neil Harrison said: \"The topic of waste is not necessarily the most engaging. \"By tapping into the social media influencers we had the best reach of any campaign that we've ever run.\"\n\nThe group said the near-£2m cost of the clean-up by Welsh councils was \"hitting the public purse\". \"They'd rather be spending that money on vital services, which are stretched at the moment,\" said Mr Harrison. \"No-one wants to live in an area blighted by litter and fly-tipping.\" There were more than 25,000 enforcement actions in the past year, leading to about 1,000 fines and 102 prosecutions. NRW said this represented a 50% increase in successful prosecutions. It comes as a number of councils in England are considering increasing the amount people can be fined for misdemeanours such as fly-tipping.\n\nThis mattress was dumped against a tree in Cardiff, where the council spent £300,426 clearing fly-tipped waste in 2023-24\n\nMr Harrison said the Welsh government \"aren't currently looking at that\", but he would like to see harsher penalties for fly-tippers. Fiona McAllister, of the Keep Grangetown Tidy group in Cardiff, said the figures were depressing but \"not really surprising\". She said the group of volunteers, who have been litter picking in the area for nearly 10 years, saw \"an awful lot of fly-tipping\".\n\nKeep Grangetown Tidy's volunteer litter-pickers like Sara Jones come across a wide selection of fly-tipped items - including this spray tan booth\n\nSome of their worst finds have included a spray tan booth and \"almost new\" household goods which could have been donated or repurposed.

The council said it had undertaken \"preventative actions\" to try and tackle the problem, including more CCTV in hotspots and increasing patrols by council officers. Yvonne Forsey, cabinet member for climate change and biodiversity, said the increase in incidents \"has been matched by a corresponding increase in our action we have taken, which is in contrast to the picture across Wales as a whole\".

{"context": "Law graduate Zara Aleena was walking home from a night out\n\nFailures “across multiple agencies” contributed to the death of Zara Aleena, who was raped and murdered as she walked home from a night out in east London, in June 2022, an inquest jury has found. Jordan McSweeney was jailed for life with a minimum term of 33 years at the Old Bailey for the killing and sexual assault of the 35-year-old law graduate. He had been released from prison on licence nine days before he attacked Ms Aleena as she walked home in Ilford - a probation report found he was not categorised as a high-risk offender when he should have been. Ms Aleena's aunt Farah Naz said the failings recorded were \"a damning reflection of our state services that are meant to protect us and were meant to protect Zara”.\n\nHM Prison and Probation Service has apologised and said \"significant steps\" had been taken to address its failings. Ms Aleena died in hospital from a blunt force head injury and neck compression, the inquest jury said. Area coroner Nadia Persaud paid tribute to Ms Aleena, who died two years ago to the day, and said: “I would like to send my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Zara.” A video montage of pictures and videos from throughout Ms Aleena’s life was played to East London Coroner’s Court. McSweeney was handed a life sentence with a minimum term of 38 years at the Old Bailey in December 2022 after admitting Ms Aleena’s murder and sexual assault. In November 2023, he won a Court of Appeal bid to reduce the minimum term.\n\nMs Persaud had asked jurors to consider whether any failings by the prison and probation services or Metropolitan Police contributed to Ms Aleena’s death. Police were unable to make contact with McSweeney after he was released on licence on 17 June 2022, but probation waited five days before initiating his recall to prison. He missed his probation appointment on the day he was let out, and his mother told staff he had passed out drunk at her house, the inquest heard. It was rescheduled twice but McSweeney did not attend either appointment, and when officers approached his mother again she said she did not know where he was. Despite the lack of contact his recall was not initiated until 22 June and the recall report was signed on 24 June. Police were given powers to arrest McSweeney at 16:10 the same day.\n\nJordan McSweeney won an appeal to reduce the minimum term of his life sentence from 38 to 33 years\n\nIn the early hours of 26 June, McSweeney murdered Ms Aleena. His probation worker, recently qualified Austin Uwaifo, said McSweeney should have been graded high risk and, had he been, he would have pushed for him to have been recalled to prison earlier. Mr Uwaifo said: “At the time, the thinking was that ", "continuation": "because he came out on the Friday, my thinking was to give him the opportunity to return - possibly he came out and decided to, for whatever reason, decided to go out and get drunk.” Mr Uwaifo said the probation office was not staffed over the weekend but that he would have requested a faster out-of-hours emergency recall if McSweeney had been graded high risk. The inquest was told the police officer who actioned McSweeney’s recall said initial inquiries into his whereabouts were closed prematurely and more checks should have been carried out.\n\nMs Naz said she and the family welcomed the jury's conclusions, but: \"Knowing Zara's death was preventable makes me very, very sad. \"She could have been here. \"We get to the end of this process and we don’t really win anything.\"\n\nKim Thornden-Edwards, the chief probation officer, said steps taken since Ms Aleena's death included mandatory training to improve risk assessments and implementing new processes to ensure the swift recall of offenders. \"We will consider the coroner’s findings carefully and respond in due course,\" she added."}

South Korea: How two hours of martial law unfolded\n\nEmbattled South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has defended his shock decision to declare martial law last week, saying he did it to protect the country's democracy. In a surprise televised address on Thursday, he said the attempt was a legal decision to \"prevent the collapse\" of democracy and counter the opposition's \"parliamentary dictatorship\". Yoon has suggested that he would not step down ahead of a second vote to impeach him in parliament on Saturday. \"I will stand firm whether I'm impeached or investigated,\" he said. \"I will fight to the end\".\n\nThe president and his allies are facing investigations on insurrection charges, and he and several of them have been banned from leaving South Korea. On Thursday, the opposition-led parliament voted to impeach police chief Cho Ji-ho and justice minister Park Sung-jae. The two officials have been immediately suspended. Unlike impeachment motions against presidents, which require 200 votes in the 300-strong National Assembly to be passed, other officials can be impeached with 150 votes. In his address, his first since his apology over the weekend, Yoon denied that his martial law order was an act of insurrection, claiming that his political rivals were creating \"false incitement\" to bring him down. Yoon repeated many of the same arguments that he used on the night he declared martial law: that the opposition was dangerous, and that by seizing control, he had been trying to protect the public and defend democracy. However, Yoon added that he would not avoid his \"legal and political responsibilities\".\n\nLast Saturday, an attempt by opposition lawmakers to impeach the president failed after members of his own ruling People Power Party (PPP) boycotted the vote. But opposition members are set to hold another impeachment vote this weekend and have vowed to hold one every Saturday until Yoon is removed from office. The floor leader of the PPP, Choo Kyung-ho, stepped down after the failed impeachment attempt, and on Thursday the party elected Kwon Seong-dong, a Yoon loyalist, as his replacement. Kwon told reporters on Thursday that he would hold discussions with PPP lawmakers on whether they should continue opposing Yoon's impeachment. Yoon's party had been hoping to convince the president to leave office early, rather than force him out. Minutes before Yoon spoke, his party leader Han Dong-hoon appeared on television saying it had become clear that the president was not going to step aside. Han then urged members of the party to vote to remove him from office this Saturday. The opposition tabled another impeachment motion on Thursday, setting the stage for a vote at 17:00 local time (09:00 GMT) Saturday. If South Korea's parliament passes the impeachment bill, a trial would be held by the Constitutional Court. Two-thirds of that court would have to sustain the majority for Yoon to be removed from office permanently. Yoon has been a lame duck president since the opposition won the April general election by a landslide - his government has not been able to pass the laws it wanted and has been reduced to vetoing bills proposed by the opposition. Yoon also accused North Korea sympathisers of trying to undermine his government when he declared martial law on the night of 3 December. The announcement plunged the country into political turmoil. Protesters faced off against security forces in front of the National Assembly building while lawmakers scrambled to vote down Yoon's order. Yoon withdrew his m", "continuation": "artial law order hours after it was blocked by lawmakers. Since then, the country has remained on edge. There have been huge protests and strikes calling for Yoon's impeachment, and the presidential office was raided on Wednesday as Yoon faces multiple investigations on charges of insurrection and treason.

He is in a stable condition."}
{"context": "The text has been a popular option for schools teaching GCSE English literature\n\nThe classic American novel Of Mice and Men will no longer be studied at GCSE in Wales from next September amid concerns about racism and the use of racial slurs. John Steinbeck's text, set in the 1930s, has been a mainstay of the English literature qualification for many years. Wales' Children's Commissioner Rocio Cifuentes welcomed the move and said having to discuss the book in class had been \"psychologically and emotionally\" harmful for some black children. The WJEC exam board said it had selected \"a wide range\" of \"appropriate and inclusive texts\" as part of a new English language and literature GCSE.\n\nMs Cifuentes said many black children had \"specifically mentioned this text and the harm that it caused them\" when she spoke to them as part of research on racism in secondary schools. She said it was important to have \"opportunities for positive, constructive, informed discussions on race and racism\" but there were \"alternative texts available, which could still offer the same opportunities but in a less directly harmful way\". \"It's not censorship,\" she said. \"This is safeguarding the wellbeing of children who have told us how awful those discussions have made them feel in those classrooms. \"They've very often been the only black child in that classroom when discussions all around them are focusing on very derogatory, negative depictions of black people.\"\n\nStudying Of Mice and Men has been \"damaging\" for some children, Wales' children's commissioner says\n\nMarley, 16, listened to the audio book with the rest of the class when he studied Of Mice and Men. When it came to the racial slurs, people \"laughed and giggled and stared at me and it made me feel really uncomfortable\". Bowen Cole, 18, studied another classic novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, which also does not feature in the new qualification. It is using \"the words that should not be said in this day and age\" in class that is problematic, not the books more generally, the former Welsh Youth Parliament member said. \"I was the only black person there in a class which was completely white,\" said Bowen, who found hearing the racist language in the book repeated in lessons \"really awkward\" and \"confusing\".\n\nMarley said the racial slurs in the book made him uncomfortable\n\nSteinbeck's 1937 novel is currently one of five options offered to schools as part of a unit in the WJEC's English literature GCSE. It is set at the time of the Great Depression and follows two ranch workers in California who move from place to place looking for work. Rhian Evans, an English teacher at Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Bro Myrddin in Carmarthen, said it was a popular choice for schools because it was accessible for children of all abilities and introduced important themes about \"how we treat each other in general in our societies\".

Celyn, 16, had mixed feelings about the novel and said its depiction of women and other \"old-fashioned\" beliefs made her feel uncomfortable. \"I think it made us more aware maybe that some things still haven't changed,\" she added. Jack, 17, said: \"Before we got to a bit that was going to be uncomfortable we had a discussion as a class and we would agree on what would be OK.\"\n\nPupils discussed how they would approach some of the difficult parts of the novel\n\nThe new qualification, merging English language and literature in one GCSE, is part of a wider overhaul of qualifications in Wales from next September. The WJEC said: \"This is a new qualification, and as such, our starting point for selecting texts was not the existing English literature qualification.\" It employed an anti-racism consultant \"to help us ensure our qualifications reflect a modern and inclusive Wales\" and consulted with a broad range of organisations. It added: \"We have provided a choice of work from writers of diverse backgrounds, nationalities, genders, and communities. \"We believe this new selection will enrich the educational experience by providing a choice of texts that explore themes that will resonate with learners.\" Of Mice and Men is an optional text on the GCSE English literature course in Northern Ireland.

You couldn't enjoy it. You couldn't see it,\" Mr Simmons told the BBC. \"It's exhilarating.\"\n\nMr Simmons was released from prison in July 2023. In December he was declared innocent in the 1974 murder of Carolyn Sue Rogers.

But it's like a rubber band - you expand and you return.\"\n\nIn January 1975 Mr Simmons was one of several people arrested at a party on separate \"bogus robbery charges\", he said.\n\nHe was brought into a police station, where officers asked him to participate in a line-up for the murder of Rogers the month before, in a liquor store robbery in an Oklahoma City suburb. The murder of Rogers - who was working as a store clerk when she was shot in the head - has yet to be solved.\n\n\"I had just turned 21. I had no previous experience with the criminal justice system,\" Mr Simmons said. \"I didn't know I had a right to an attorney, a right to refuse. I had no clue.\"\n\nA customer who was shot in the head during the incident was asked to pick out the murder suspect from the line-up just days after getting out of the hospital, Mr Simmons said.\n\nShe never identified Mr Simmons, he said. Instead, she pointed to different characteristics of at least three others in the line-up, according to Mr Simmons' lawyer, Joe Norwood.\n\nStill, Mr Simmons - who said he was in Louisiana at the time of the murder - was convicted and given the death penalty.\n\n\"I don't call it a miscarriage of justice. It wasn't a mistake.

{"context": "'Nobody is catching domestic machine Celtic now'\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nIt's possible there were more hostile places on earth on Wednesday evening than Pittodrie; windier, rainier, colder, noisier. But frankly, we doubt it. Aberdeen versus Celtic, the meeting of the top two teams in the Premiership, was, in effect, the Battle in the Blizzard, the Match in the Monsoon, a game played in foul conditions and yet a night that never stopped having a grisly fascination. Reo Hatate won it with a sumptuous finish that was in stark contrast to the awfulness of the weather, a gorgeous thing on a grind of a night. Celtic won and deserved to - character as much as class sealed it - but Aberdeen were no pushovers. They're on a winless run now but none of their supporters should worry all that much. The heart is beating strongly in these boys. They weren't good enough on Wednesday but they'll be plenty good enough on days to come.\n\nFrom the moment when Cameron Carter-Vickers was ironically cheered by the Red Shed after successfully completing a backpass to his goalkeeper - something he failed to do a week ago against Club Brugge - to the lusty tackle Kevin Nisbet put in when ransacking Alex Valle, this was tumultuous stuff. Only a minute had been played and skin and hair was flying. Steady rain and regular aggro. On the radio gantry, the great Willie Miller smiled, wistfully. An old school scrap. Toe to toe. Where else would you rather be? Some might tell you the most beautiful sound in the world is birds chirping, leaves rustling, a fire crackling. On evenings like this, it was a touch more fundamental. An Aberdeen tackle - legal or otherwise - brought a cacophony. Sweet music. A couple of minutes in, Kyogo Furuhashi went haring away into space deep in the Aberdeen half, the inexperienced goalkeeper Ross Doohan his only obstacle to a possible opener. Total commitment from both men meant a brutal collision. Kyogo, blameless, clashed with Doohan's head and it was worrying. The goalkeeper stayed down awhile. Replays showed the extent of the dunt. Kyogo, touchingly, stayed with him all the time. You thought Doohan’s day was done but he picked himself up and carried on. In the days of Dimitar Mitov, Doohan's time on the pitch has been limited, but he was good on Wednesday night. Durable after the Kyogo incident and inspired at times later on when Celtic started to pile on the pressure. The Dons dug in. They weren't all that threatening in attack, they didn’t cause Kasper Schmeichel a whole pile of trouble until the closing minutes when they were chasing like madmen, but they were dogged against the champions, they made a fight of it against an attacking force that put six on them the last time they played. Celtic always suggested that a goal was coming. Towards the end of the first half they had a series of corners, vicious deliveries whipped in from the beach end. Paulo Bernardo scored directly from one of them, but it was correctly ruled out when Daizen Maeda was seen to have backed into Doohan. Alistair Johnston was a few feet away from connecting with another, a touch probably being enough to break the deadlock. The jostling amid all this was intense. No quarter asked, no quarter given. It wasn't pretty, but given the lousy conditions and the bearpit nature of the contest, it was compelling.\n\nCeltic are a domestic machine. It's easy for them when the sun shines and their game is connected and the stars are all aligned. They nearly always win. Other questions were asked here. A baying home crowd, vile weather, a belligerent opponent. And they won again. Formidable and unstoppable. The clues were coming. In the 71st minute they pushed Aberdeen back, almost into the front rows of the Red Shed. Johnston had a shot blocked, then another, then Hatate had a shot saved by Doohan, then Doohan saved from Adam Idah, a flying stop away to his right that made you wonder for a second if the deadlock could be broken, if Aberdeen's resistance could, in fact, hold. Or better. Leighton Clarkson was in space in front of Celtic's goal, but pulled his shot and the moment passed. Teams who miss chances tend to regret them when it's Celtic down the other end. Two minutes after Clarkson missed, Hatate scored. It was Greg Taylor, the full-back on as a substitute for Valle, who played it into Hatate. Taylor doesn't have Valle's glamorous", "continuation": " Barcelona back story, but he continues to be an invaluable operator in Celtic's unrelenting nature. He chipped it into Hatate and then a thing of beauty broke out for the first time on the night. Hatate chested it, let it fall and calmly hit it on the half-volley. One fluid movement, one classy goal. It was enough, just. Aberdeen came back at them, Sokler lashing one over when he had Schmeichel in his sights. The grunt put in by Carter-Vickers in trying to close him down was the sign of a player battling to the last. Celtic won and their lead at the top now looks insurmountable at seven points, plus a game in hand. Let's be honest, the league is done. It was clear nobody was realistically going to catch this Celtic team before Wednesday and, after Hatate's star turn, it's all but certain nobody is catching them now."}

Britain's Jemma Reekie had appeared in control of proceedings but faded to finish fifth in 4:06.17, while team-mate Katie Snowden was ninth (4:06.83). Bird, 29, was temporarily lifted to the silver medal position after winner Alice Finot of France (9:16.22) was disqualified for an infringement on the inside of the track. But following an appeal, Finot was reinstated and Gesa Felicitas Krause of Germany (9:18.06) had to settle for silver.\n\nAsher-Smith's experiences in Munich two years ago led the former 200m world champion to call for more research into the effect of periods on performance, after her 100m title defence was ruined mid-race by calf cramps caused by her cycle.

{"context": "Moment of big opportunity and high risk for", "continuation": " Marine Le Pen\n\nMarine Le Pen has played a waiting game for years as National Rally’s leader\n\nBacking the collapse of Michel Barnier's French government is a high-stakes moment for Marine Le Pen. It could lead to her best chance of power yet as head of France’s far-right National Rally. \"I'm not calling for Emmanuel Macron's resignation,\" she said, but she made it perfectly clear he was responsible for France's political deadlock and \"pressure on the president will become stronger and stronger\". Before she had decided to push for Barnier's downfall, she said she wasn’t \"the master of the clocks\" - the one who dictated the agenda. But that may well be exactly what she now becomes, by bringing down Emmanuel Macron’s second government since he beat her to the presidency for a second time in 2022. As his presidency looks ever weaker, it is Le Pen who appears to have the upper hand.\n\nHowever, this situation is not without immense risks for her too. Le Pen has played a waiting game for years as National Rally’s leader. She may be tantalisingly close to power now - but she is having to make big choices.\n\nPushing for a no-confidence vote \"comes as a considerable risk because people are now wondering if she’s really acting in the interests of the country or her own, personal interests,\" says Prof Armin Steinbach of HEC business school in Paris. “What is obvious is that it’s not about Barnier... it’s about her trying to overthrow and weaken Macron, obviously for her personal ambitions to herself become the next president,” he told the BBC. Le Pen has long sought to “normalise” National Rally (RN) in the eyes of the French people, rebranding it six years ago from her father’s old National Front. Jump back a few months to France’s snap parliamentary elections when RN came first with 32% of the vote. Her mission appeared almost complete, even if it could only manage third place in the run-off round. Now in the dying days of 2024, she is taking a gamble on whether French voters will see her as acting in the national interest in bringing down a weakened government because she objects to its 2025 budget that aims to bring down France’s budget deficit from 6% of national output, or GDP. Barnier had already agreed to several of her demands on social security - but Le Pen decided it was not enough. There are real economic risks for France, as well as real political risks for Le Pen in backing a left-sponsored vote of no confidence. After only three months in the job, Barnier has appealed to MPs to act in France’s greater interest, but Le Pen’s party leader Jordan Bardella has accused him of adopting a “strategy of fear”. RN adviser Philippe Olivier told Le Monde the president was “a fallen republican monarch, advancing with his shirt open and a rope around his neck up to the next dissolution [of parliament]”. It was Macron’s surprise decision to call an early parliamentary election in June that has left France in the political deadlock it finds itself now. Le Pen’s argument is that Barnier didn’t include enough of her demands in his budget, while Barnier said his budget wasn’t “aimed to please” - and he accused her of \"trying to get into a kind of bidding war\" during their negotiations. The RN leader could end up plunging France “into the great political and financial unknown”, in the words of Le Figaro deputy editor Vincent Trémolet de Villers. She won’t want to be labelled as the politician who pushed France into economic turbulence when in her eyes it is Macron who is to blame for France’s economic state. “It’s a result of seven years of amateurism and a spectacular drift in our public finances,” she has said. There are plenty of French voters who want Macron gone before his term ends in 2027. Recent polls suggest at least 62% of the electorate think the president should resign if the Barnier government falls. National Rally would arguably be in line with the broader electorate if it pushed for that, even if Le Pen has not yet done so. But the RN leader has other issues going on behind the scenes which her critics believe might be influencing her judgement. On 31 March, a French court will rule in a long-running trial against her and other party figures on allegations of misuse of European Parliament funding. Prosecutors want her to go to jail and face a five-year ban in public office. If that were to happen, her hopes of winning the presidency would be dashed. For Marine Le Pen this moment really could be now or never. Three times she has run for the top job. If she does get to run a fourth time in the coming months she is in with a strong chance of winning.

Watch: Vulcan rocket sends Moon mission on its way\n\nAn US spacecraft has launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to try to perform a controlled landing on the Moon.\n\nIt's aiming to become the first American mission in 51 years to complete a soft touch-down, and the first ever by a private company.\n\nAstrobotic's robotic lander, called Peregrine, has been contracted by Nasa to carry five scientific instruments.\n\nThese will study the Moon's surface environment ahead of human missions later this decade.\n\nPeregrine is part of a stampede of spacecraft that will attempt to put themselves on the lunar surface in 2024 - possibly as many as eight different projects, including from Japan and China.\n\nThe 1.2-tonne Peregrine spacecraft is one of a clutch of US projects aiming to land in 2024\n\nAstrobotic's venture was sent on its way by a brand new rocket called Vulcan, which left its Florida pad at 02:18 EST (07:18 GMT). Fifty minutes later, after a flawless flight, the Pittsburgh-based company's craft was ejected on a path to the Moon.\n\nIt will take a few weeks to get itself into position to attempt the touch-down.\n\nThe planned 23 February descent will target a smooth lava plain on the Moon's near-side known as Sinus Viscositatis, or \"Bay of Stickiness\" - a reference to the type of volcanic material that may have built nearby hills.\n\nNot since the last Apollo mission in 1972 has there been any US effort to place a spacecraft gently on the lunar surface - although US probes have been deliberately crashed into the Moon for one reason or another in the meantime.\n\nNot since Apollo 17 in 1972 has the US soft-landed a spacecraft on the lunar surface\n\nRunning surface operations is back on the agenda because Nasa wishes soon to resume astronaut missions, and it is going to use robots from commercial partners to deliver scientific instrumentation, general equipment and supplies - a move the agency believes will work to reduce costs over time.\n\nAstrobotic is the first of three US companies to send a lander under this new arrangement. Two other companies, Intuitive Machines and Firefly, will follow in the coming months.\n\nIndeed, it's possible Houston-based Intuitive Machines may even beat Astrobotic to the surface because although its lander is not due to launch until mid-February, it's taking a quicker route to the Moon.\n\nAll three US companies have Nasa as a \"customer\", but the agency is \"not in charge\" of their missions. It is the firms themselves who have designed the spacecraft and will be in command as the missions progress.\n\n\"This initiative is incredibly important,\" said Andy Jones, director of landers and s", "continuation": "pacecraft at Astrobotic.\n\n\"It's allowed a small company like Astrobotic to deliver a lander to the Moon. We'd never have been able to achieve it without that. But the best thing is it's bringing a lot more creative minds, new minds, new thinking to the table, and that will help accelerate the technologies needed to get us back to the Moon and have a more robust presence on the Moon.\"\n\nPeregrine will aim for the flat volcanic terrain just south of the Gruithuisen hills\n\nNasa's payloads on Peregrine are focused on preparations for the later human presence on the lunar surface.\n\nThe Peregrine Ion Mass Spectrometer (PITMS), for example, will try to understand better how water moves across the Moon. Water is seen as a potential resource for future astronauts, either for drinking or as the basis of a rocket fuel.\n\nThe main sensor in PITMS was built in the UK by the Open University (OU) and RAL-Space.\n\nThe OU's Dr Simeon Barber led the development. \"Water is really important for astronauts to drink, for sanitation. It's really the key molecule for unlocking the future and a new way of doing space exploration,\" he told BBC News.\n\nBecause Nasa is classed as just a customer on the mission, Astrobotic has been free to sell payload space to others. The most significant of these additional items are a number of small rovers, including a clutch of tiny two-wheeled robots from Mexico.\n\nThere are also cultural items onboard, such as photos, drawings, plaques and audio recordings, but, controversially, there is a consignment of cremated human remains, too. Two companies have small \"memorial\" capsules on Peregrine, one of which contains the DNA of renowned British science-fiction writer Arthur C Clarke.\n\nUK scientists, led by Dr Simeon Barber from the OU, have developed the sensor inside one Nasa instrument\n\nThis is something that has drawn the ire of the Navajo Nation, the North American indigenous people, who regard the Moon as sacred. They've appealed to Nasa to stop the mission, which they see as an act of desecration.\n\nThe first of 2024's lunar touch-down attempts will be conducted by the Japanese space agency (Jaxa) and is expected on 15 January.\n\nJaxa's Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (Slim) will target a location near Shioli crater, which is just south of the Moon's equator on its near-side.\n\nChina will continue its recent exploration efforts on the Moon by sending a mission to the far-side to bring some of the rocks there back to Earth for study. This should happen mid-year.\n\nWhile the focus in the coming weeks will be squarely on Peregrine's travels, It's worth reflecting also on the success of the Vulcan, which was making its maiden flight after 10 years of development.\n\nThe company behind the vehicle - United Launch Alliance - has an established pedigree of putting up US national security missions and Nasa missions. Vulcan will take on this work as ULA's current stable of rockets is retired.\n\nThe company's president and CEO, Tory Bruno, couldn't hide his joy at the conclusion of the new rocket's ascent.\n\n\"Yeehaw!\" the executive, who is often seen in a cowboy hat, shouted. \"I am so thrilled. I am so proud of this team. Oh my gosh, this has been years of hard work.\""}

In doing so, the world number one became just the second player after Tiger Woods to win the Players Championship, Masters and Memorial in the same year. The American led on 10 under overnight, four clear of Morikawa, Adam Hadwin and Sepp Straka but, rather than the expected procession, he was pushed all the way. \"I didn't do a whole lot well but I did enough to get it done,\" said Scheffler, who carded a two-over 74 to win his 11th PGA Tour title on eight under. \"I feel like I've had some close calls in this tournament.

Scheffler was up first and rolled his effort into the middle of the cup to seal the win and $4m (£3.14m) first prize.

Rory McIlroy closed with a 76 to end two over, one ahead of England's Tommy Fleetwood who also shot a 76. Ireland's Shane Lowry, who was playing with Northern Ireland's McIlroy, had a disastrous round which included seven bogeys, two doubles and a triple-bogey seven on the 17th as he shot a 13-over-par 85 to finish 12 over.\n\nMexico's Carlos Ortiz won LIV Golf Houston to claim his first title on the tour.

Last year, the Labour leader said \"99.9% of women\" do not have a penis and in 2021 stated it was \"not right\" for Labour MP Rosie Duffield to say that \"only women have a cervix\".

Reacting to her comments, a Labour spokesperson said: “Sex and gender are different, as Labour’s Equality Act makes clear. \"That’s why we have consistently said that we will not introduce self ID and that we will protect single sex spaces for biological women.\"\n\nUnder the Equality Act 2010, it is illegal to discriminate against anyone because of \"protected characteristics\". These are a set of identifying traits that are protected by law and include age, disability, religion, race, sex and sexual orientation among others. Some interpret sex in this context as referring strictly to biological sex, while others believe it also applies to people with a gender recognition certificate; a legal document that allows someone to change the legal sex on their birth certificate. The Conservatives have said they would change the act to apply to biological sex, and say single-sex spaces, such as public toilets and hospital wards, and services such as rape crisis centres do not have to be open to those who are biologically male but identify as female. Labour says such a change is not needed as the Equality Act already protects single-sex spaces for biological women but the party says it would produce \"clearer guidance\" on the issue if it wins the general election.\n\nRowling also accused Sir Keir Starmer of offering no support to Rosie Duffield over the threats and abuse she has received \"some of which has originated from within the Labour Party itself\".

Labour peer Lord Cashman was suspended from the Labour Party in Parliament by Sir Keir after calling Ms Duffield \"frit or lazy\" for withdrawing from the events, in a social media post. The former EastEnders actor and Labour MEP apologised \"unreservedly\" for the post. Earlier this month, an internet troll who posted online messages threatening to kill Ms Rowling and Ms Duffield was given suspended jail sentences.

{"context": "The boss of Thames Water has defended executive bonuses as the firm calls for a hike in customer bills to ensure its survival. Chris Weston said the supplier needed to offer \"competitive packages\" to attract talent, but the water regulator has previously said that customers must not foot the bill for \"undeserved bonuses\". It comes as the embattled company saw a 40% increase in pollution incidents in the six months to 30 September, as its debts continued to swell, according to its latest set of results. Thames approaches a critical moment next week, with Ofwat set to decide whether to allow a proposed 59% increase in consumer bills over the next five years.\n\nThe ailing business is saddled with debts which stood at just under £16bn at the end of September. The firm has said customer bills need to rise or else it will not be able to recover from its financial crisis. However, if the company does collapse, water supplies will not be affected. Water firms across the UK have faced a fierce backlash over sewage discharges and pipe leaks in recent years, but Thames has been in the spotlight given its debt pile, and the fact one in four people in the UK rely on it. Critics have argued the water industry has historically neglected investment in favour of paying executive bonuses and shareholder dividends. But on Tuesday, Mr Weston defended bosses getting £770,000 in bonuses. \"I completely understand that there are customers out there who struggle with their bills,\" he added, pointing to bill support offered to about 377,000 customers in the last year. Mr Weston, who was hired in January, was also awarded a bonus of £195,000 for his first three months at the company. The regulator Ofwat recently blocked three companies, including Thames, from using customer money to pay executive bonuses as bills have steadily increased.\n\nA final decision on whether Thames can increase its bills by 59% is due on 19 December. Mr Weston described the upcoming decision as a \"critical\" step which would be \"fundamental\" to the company's future. Bosses have argued they need extra cash to make Thames \"investible\" enough to attract fresh funding, and to pay for improvements to its network of pipes and sewers. Thames reported a 40% rise in sewage pollution with 359 incidents in the six months to September. Mr Weston blamed a particularly wet spring and summer period, and said that problems with its infrastructure were \"decades in the making\". Ofwat has also appointed an independent monitor to supervise Thames as it attempts its turnaround.\n\nThe company could run out of money within the first three months of 2025, which is why its creditors have offered it a further £3bn cash loan to be released in two tranches, the first £1.5bn of which could be released in February. It is waiting for a court date next week to approve the cash injection which could prove pivotal as it would mean it had enough money to last until October next year. An insider told the BBC that if it was not for the firm's huge debt pile, Thames would be in reasonable shape financially. In its latest results, it reported a profit before tax of £249.6m for the six months to September, up 20% on the year before.\n\nWhen Thames Water was privatised in 1989 it had no debt. However, over the years it borrowed heavily. Thames needs to raise about £4bn in new equity too, which would not need to be paid back. While there are several interested parties that could put that money in, the investment would depend on how much pain lenders are willing to take and whether or not Ofwat will allow the company to push through steep bill increases. Mr Weston said on Tuesday there was \"considerable interest\" from po", "continuation": "tential equity investors in the company. But the process for an equity injection cannot be finalised until Ofwat makes a decision on bill increases. Unions argued on Tuesday that a recovery for the company was now \"virtually impossible\". Gary Carter, the national officer of the GMB union, called for government to step in. \"Right now the company is being squashed by an ever-increasing debt mountain, on increasingly arduous terms,\" he added. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham also called for officials to stand up for the \"public interest\" and consider bringing Thames back into public ownership. Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Weston said that the firm had not asked the government or regulators to step in and implement a form of publicly funded administration, called a special administration regime.\n\nAre your water bills on the rise?"}

Sunak and Starmer clash over taxes and economy\n\nThe top Treasury civil servant has said the Conservatives' assessment of Labour's tax plans “should not be presented as having been produced by the civil service”. In a letter to the Labour Party two days ago, seen by the BBC, Treasury permanent secretary James Bowler said the calculation of £38bn of uncosted spending used by the Tories \"includes costs beyond those provided by the civil service”. The letter risks undermining Rishi Sunak’s claim in Tuesday evening's head-to-head debate that Labour’s plans would mean £2,000 of tax rises per working household. \"Labour has no plans to increase taxes on working people,\" she said, reiterating that the party has ruled out increasing the rate of income tax, National Insurance and VAT. During the debate itself, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer dismissed the figures as \"absolute garbage\". Treasury Minister Laura Trott stood by the claims, and rejected the suggestion Mr Sunak had lied about Labour's tax plans. She said: \"This is underpinned overwhelmingly by Treasury analysis so if people think Labour are going to win this election they need to start saving.\"\n\nHowever, in a letter to Labour's Darren Jones, Mr Bowler wrote: “As you will expect, civil servants were not involved in the production or presentation of the Conservative Party’s document ‘Labour’s Tax Rises’ or in the calculation of the total figure used … the £38bn figure used in the Conservative Party’s publication includes costs beyond those provided by the civil service.\" Mr Bowler added that he had reminded ministers and", "continuation": " advisers that “any costings derived from other sources or produced by other organisations should not be presented as having been produced by the civil service”. The UK’s official statistics regulator said it was looking into the Conservatives' claim. The Office for Statistics Regulation - which is the independent regulatory arm of the UK Statistics Authority - is investigating, but it is not known precisely how long that will take. An investigation can be prompted by a complaint, and when an inquiry is complete, its conclusion becomes public.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'I don't think Keir Starmer expected the PM to lie last night'\n\nA Conservative Party spokesperson said: “We were fair to Labour in the production of the Labour tax rise briefing note and used only clear Labour policies, their own costings or official HMT [HM Treasury] costings using the lowest assumptions.” Earlier Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho told BBC Breakfast the costings had been \"signed off by the permanent secretary of the Treasury\" and if anything the Tory claim was “an underestimate”. “These are brilliant independent civil servants and they would not be putting anything dodgy in there,\" she said. Former head of the civil service Lord O’Donnell said costing of opposition party policies was \"one of the grubbiest processes I've ever been involved in\" and had been carried out by both Labour and the Conservatives in the past. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: \"Ministers tell you to produce these costings on some assumptions they give you, which are dodgy assumptions designed to make the policy look as bad as possible.\"\n\nDuring a head-to-head debate on ITV on Tuesday evening, Mr Sunak repeatedly claimed Labour’s spending plans would mean “£2,000 in higher taxes for every working family in our country”. The Conservatives came up with the number based on how much they say Labour's spending commitments would cost, dividing this by the number of UK households with at least one person working. It covers a period of four years. While Mr Sunak suggested the costings had been worked out by impartial civil servants, they are based on assumptions made by politically appointed special advisers. The claim went unchallenged for about 20 minutes but Sir Keir later called it \"nonsense\". Asked why Sir Keir did not use the letter to rebut Mr Sunak's attacks during the debate, Ms Reeves said the Labour leader was “really clear” that what the PM said was “utter garbage”. She added: “I don’t think Keir Starmer expected the prime minister to lie in the debate last night”. The £2,000 figure was first used by the Conservatives in an advertising campaign in May."}

{"context": "Leila Mitchell visited the volcano in 2022 with her boyfriend, Louis Martlew\n\nAt one of Central America’s most popular tourist spots, you can stand a few hundred metres from boiling volcanic lava. Meet any backpacker in a hostel bar in Central America, there is a high chance they have hiked, or are planning to hike, the twin volcanoes ", "continuation": "of Acatenango and Fuego. “The thing I remember most is the sound of the bubbling,” recalls 23-year-old Leila Mitchell, who visited in 2022. “Huge spurts of orange, glowing lava. It was breath-taking.” Recent increased volcanic activity has sent the popularity of the tours skyrocketing – but it's also made them more dangerous. “It’s only a matter of time before someone gets killed,” says Matthew Watson, Professor of Volcanoes and Climate at the University of Bristol.\n\nFuego's eruptions can be seen from its neighbour Acatenango\n\nThe twin volcanoes sit on the outskirts of Antigua, a city in the central highlands of Guatemala. Climbing them is considered a rite of passage for travellers visiting the country, and it is Fuego in particular that they come to see as this active volcano can erupt 200 times a day. Capitalising on this feat of nature are the numerous tour companies which take groups perilously close to Fuego’s simmering crater. Some are known to go within 100 metres of its rim.\n\nA lethal eruption in 2018 buried the town of San Miguel Los Lotes\n\nProf Watson used to take students on a yearly field trip to Fuego – but stopped in 2015 after it became more energetic. “An INSIVUMEH volcanologist advised against going up there, and we’ve not been up since,” he says. INSIVUMEH is a government agency that monitors Fuego. Since 1999, it has recorded 79 serious eruptions – called paroxysms – with more than 47 occurring after 2015. Six years ago, this ratcheting up of activity had tragic consequences. On 3 June 2018, a powerful eruption caught much of the surrounding area by surprise. It buried the entire town of San Miguel Los Lotes under ash and rock.\n\nLocals say as many as 3,500 people were killed in the 2018 eruption\n\nJonathan Dovgan Prera was on his way back to Acatenango from Fuego that day with a tour group he was guiding. “I remember hearing the tremors. An older guide said something bad was about to happen… ‘just run’.” His tour group that day was made up of university athletes, who managed to sprint back to base camp unscathed. “You could feel the ash and small rocks hitting you,” he recalls. “That was one of the scariest moments of my life.” The official death toll from the eruption was 218 people, but locals say as many as 3,500 people disappeared that day. Prof Watson says out-of-date census data explains this discrepancy, as well as the difficulty in identifying remains. Despite his near-death experience, Jonathan has continued to climb Fuego and leads two to three tour groups a week up the active volcano. “Explosive activity continues to happen daily, virtually uninterrupted” says Roberto Mérida, a volcanologist at INSIVUMEH. “It is precisely what attracts the attention of tourists.” Yet many are completely unaware of the risks associated with this much-touted tourist experience. Leila's boyfriend Louis Martlew, 23, visited the volcanoes with her. “We signed a piece of paper and laughed about the fact that we were signing our life away.” It was only after they returned that another traveller told them about the 2018 eruption. “I was stupid not to realise how bad that could have been,” Leila said. “Because it’s made for tourists and it’s just a thing that happens, I thought it was perfectly safe.”\n\nLouis Martlew took this picture just metres from Fuego's rim\n\nSix years on, the hike is more popular than ever. Local guides estimate that 200 to 400 people visit the volcanoes every day, jumping to as many as 1,000 on a busy Friday or Saturday. Matt Hartell was one of the first adventure tour guides to set up shop in the area in 1998. “We’d be the only people on the mountain,” he remembers. “Now there are 30 other companies out there every day of the week.” Tourism is a huge economic driver for Antigua in particular and Guatemala in general. In 2023, the tourism industry brought over £838m to the Central American nation’s coffers. And it is those who derive their livelihoods from guiding groups up the volcanoes that are the most at risk as they spend far more time in the danger zone than most others. “Some of my guides don’t want to take people over there” says Matt Hartell, adding that he himself tries to avoid going “whenever I can”. So, is there an alternative? The terraces of Acatenango, Fuego’s dormant twin, offer a spectacular view of Fuego’s lava shows. All tours hike Acatenango first, resting in a base camp there. Those who are feeling adventurous then continue on to Fuego.\n\nThe nearby city of Antigua is often used as a stopover for tourists wishing to climb the volcanos\n\nProf Watson is baffled that tour groups continue to go the active volcano. “Given how good the observation platform from the terraces [of Acatenango] is, it seems a completely unnecessary risk.” INSIVUMEH issues daily bulletins in Spanish on Facebook, X and its website warning of risks of injury or death to those who go too close to Fuego’s crater. But as climbing Fuego is not illegal, INSIVUMEH can only warn of the risks and lacks the power to stop visitors from going there. On the ground, it is not obvious who is in charge. Local municipalities charge entry fees for various portions of each volcano and the surrounding area. Guide Matt says volcano tourism is “a cash cow” for local authorities and that the central government “just isn’t strong enough” to impose any restriction. INSIVUMEH volcanologist Roberto Mérida is pessimistic that anything will change in time to avert disaster. “Municipalities, tour operators and the tourism institute have prioritised economic exploitation over disaster prevention.” “Actions are usually [only taken] in response to tragedy,” he adds. “In this case it will be until one or more tourists die in the Fuego volcano.”\n\nMany tourists scale the volcano unaware of the risks involved\n\nIn response, the National Tourism Institute of Guatemala (INGUAT) told the BBC it “makes recommendations and suggestions for visits to national and foreign tourists based on information from official sources on risk prevention and in accordance with the regulations of each corresponding National Park, Protected Area or Nature Reserve.” INGUAT added it does not promote tourism “in places that represent any type of danger” to tourists and that it “does not receive any type of income or benefits from visits to any National Park, Natural Park or volcano.” The Muncipalities of Acatenango and San Juan Alotenango have been approached for comment. Some suggest that better communication channels could help. Dr Ailsa Naismith wrote her doctoral thesis on Fuego. On research trips, she has spoken with many guides who are eager to know more about the volcanoes they have built their careers around. “With the experience we have from researching it, it might seem blatantly obvious that it’s dangerous. But sometimes it’s not,” she says. When asked if he would like more interaction with volcanologists and monitoring bodies, guide Jonathan Dovgan Prera says he was keen. “It would teach us so much more about what to expect.” His fellow guide Matt Hartell would like to see formal roundtable conversations held between the groups who regularly visit the volcanoes and those with expertise to offer about managing both tourism and volcano conservation effectively. But volcanologists think that is not enough. Roberto Mérida suggests “a restriction zone, whose radius depends on the level of volcanic activity”. Others just think the risk is too high, and would rather no one went to Fuego at all, instead climbing just Acatenango.\n\nBut convincing keen adventure travellers is no easy task. Some, like 24-year-old Alex Gordon, say the experience of being near the simmering crater is unique – and one they are willing to take a risk for. “The feeling [of being] at the top of the volcano will sit with me forever,” he says. Leila is less sure. Having climbed both she says the dormant volcano offers stunning views and “would still be a challenging walk up a beautiful landscape”. Given what she now knows of the dangers, she'd be happy to enjoy the spectacular eruptions of Fuego from a safe distance."}

After graduating, they set up a small studio at Paul's Cheshire home and later invited a third member, Stephen Spencer (who was unrelated to his bandmate), to join. They scored a massive hit in 1997 with the summer dance anthem Sunchyme, built around a sample of Dream Academy's Life In A Northern Town. It sold more than 600,000 copies in the UK, and was only held off the number one spot by Elton John's tribute to Princess Diana, Candle In The Wind. The band - who were named after the then-manager of Crewe Alexandra FC, Dario Gradi - followed it up with another top five smash, Carnaval De Paris. The song became an unofficial anthem of the 1998 World Cup in Paris, and was later re-released for the 2002 tournament.\n\nThe star was performing live until May last year\n\nOther hits included Sunmachine, Voices and Dream to Me, which sampled the chorus of the Cranberries' Dreams. Scott and Stephen eventually left the band, with Paul continuing the act as a solo project. During that period, he recorded a track called We Got Music with Dame Shirley Bassey, and collaborated with Clean Bandit and Jess Glynne on a remix of Real Love - which incorporated elements of Sunchyme. Paul announced his cancer diagnosis last June, telling fans he was \"gonna give it my best shot though\" and urging them to \"stay positive, 'cos I am\". Over the next months, he documented his treatment on social media, and released a song Savour the Miracle of Life, to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Support. In his last post, just three weeks ago, he was still maintaining a positive attitude. \"I know you’ve been all been showing overwhelming support, love and strength for me,\" he wrote. \"I'm infection free now but feel I already have the energy to defeat this fully.\" He had been planning to play his first gig of the year at Chris Moyles' 90s Hangover concert in Swindon on 25 May, but pulled out due to his failing health."}

{"context": "The London to Birmingham stretch of the HS2 railway could cost more than £65bn in current prices, the boss of the company building it has said.\n\nSir Jonathan Thompson said a rise in the cost of materials such as concrete and steel over the past few years have added £8bn to £10bn.\n\nIn October the government cancelled the sections between the West Midlands, Manchester, and the East Midlands.\n\nNow HS2 Ltd and the government disagree on the cost of building the rest.\n\nThe company's latest estimate for the London to Birmingham stretch is between £49bn and £56.6bn in 2019 prices.\n\nThe government thinks it should be delivered at the lower end of £45bn to £54bn. These estimates were put together before October's announcement.\n\nHowever, Sir Jonathan does not believe £45bn is possible. He said the price tag might be lower without the taxpayer funding a new station at Euston, but doubted that would bring down the cost as much as the government stated.\n\nHe said the budget given for the overall programme had been too low to begin with.\n\n\"The cost of delivery is more than the government budgeted, and that is before you begin to account for the extraordinary construction inflation over the last three years or so.\"\n\nLabour said the new cost projections were a direct result of the prime minister's \"weak leadership and mismanagement of HS2\".\n\n\"As chief secretary, chancellor and now PM Rishi Sunak has allowed costs to soar and public money go down the drain. This is a government with no direction, no plan and no regard for taxpayers' money,\" shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said.\n\nWatch on BBC iPlayer how the story of HS2 unfolded.\n\nThe firm's executive chair said HS2's costs had risen so much over the past decade because of poor cost estimating, changes to the project's scope, some poor delivery and the impact of inflation. He added that decisions to delay parts of the project for cashflow reasons, could end up meaning they cost more, and that the Covid pandemic had added £500m to £600m. Sir Jonathan also said HS2 trains will travel more slowly than existing Pendolino trains when they travel on conventional tracks between Birmingham and Manchester, because they cannot tilt on bends.\n\nHe said he expects fewer seats to be available on HS2 north of Birmingham now the legs to Manchester and Crewe have been scrapped, due to trains having to be shorter to fit existing platforms. HS2 trains of the same length as the current Pendolinos would be used, but would have fewer seats.\n\nSir Jonathan also said HS2 was waiting for the government to make decisions on certain aspects of the project, including the tunnel south from Old Oak Common to Euston.\n\nDevelopment of the railway's terminus at London Euston will depend on investment from private developers, with plans to develop housing around the station.\n\nThe site for a station at Euston has already been cleared, with residents and businesses forced out.\n\nUntil the new station is built, HS2 will end at Old Oak Common in West London, meaning people would have to change trains to reach the capital's heart.\n\nThe government has said there has been interest from developers.\n\nHowever, in a BBC interview in November, the transport secretar", "continuation": "y, Mark Harper, would not say how soon he wanted to have a firm commitment from investors, or a new station design - arguing that an \"artificial deadline\" could damage the government's negotiating hand.\n\nMr Harper also could not say whether the tunnel taking trains from Old Oak Common to Euston would be paid for by private investors or the taxpayer.\n\nHe told the BBC that this would depend on \"how much private sector money we can get in\", and he wanted to \"get the best possible deal for taxpayers\".\n\nHe maintained that bringing in the private sector would help the scheme be delivered on time and budget.\n\nThe government claims getting private investors to pay for Euston will save £6.5bn.\n\nMr Harper told the BBC this figure had been reached by converting the £4.8bn cost of the latest 10-platform station design into 2023 prices.\n\nBut ministers had already said that design was unaffordable.\n\nWork on Euston was paused in March 2023, with the time to be used for developing an \"affordable and deliverable station design\".\n\nIn November, HS2 Ltd confirmed it would continue the process of buying more than 200 homes and businesses along the scrapped Manchester route on advice from the government.\n\nThe figure includes sales under \"blight\", where owners ask the government to buy their property at the price they would have been worth if an infrastructure project such as road or rail works had not lowered its market value.\n\nA spokesperson said at the time that such acquisitions may continue \"where the claimant wishes to proceed and there is a compelling case to do so\", including where applications were submitted before the government announcement.\n\n\"We have also identified a limited number of locations and properties where the compulsory purchase process is well advanced and needs to continue until it's completed,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nMeanwhile people whose land or properties had already been purchased have been left in limbo, as the government develops a plan for selling back land that's no longer needed.\n\nMinisters have said this will not be quick. Mr Harper told the BBC in November land sales would be done in a \"careful, sensible way\" without \"rushing\".\n\nFollowing Sir Jonathan's comments the Department for Transport said: \"This Government is bearing down on the cost of HS2 and reviewing the scope of Phase One to deliver the line at the lowest reasonable price for taxpayers.\n\n\"We have already taken decisive action by cancelling Phase Two of HS2, reinvesting every penny of the £36bn saved in local transport projects that will benefit more people in more places, more quickly.\""}
{"context": "Mass graves and body bags: al-Shifa hospital after Israel withdrew its forces\n\nIsraeli forces pulled out of Gaza City's al-Shifa Hospital in April\n\nAfter Israeli forces pulled out of Gaza City’s vast al-Shifa hospital complex on 1 April, following their second raid there, stunned Palestinians who pored over the burnt-out ruins said it reeked of death. During the past eight months of war, hospitals have come under repeated attack, with Israel claiming they are used as bases by Hamas; something the group denies. But events at al-Shifa – once the biggest and best equipped medical facility in the Gaza Strip – have arguably been the most dramatic. The two-week surprise raid, launched after Israel said Hamas had regrouped at the site, was described by the Israeli government as \"precise and surgical\". Its spokesman, Avi Hyman, asserted that it had set \"the gold standard of urban warfare\". He said: “We took out over 200 terrorists. We apprehended over 900 terrorists with not a single civilian casualty.” With decaying bodies sticking out of the sand piled up by combat bulldozers in the courtyards of al-Shifa, the claim that there had been no civilian casualties was immediately questioned. In recent weeks, four mass graves have been uncovered at the site, with Palestinian search teams saying that several hundred bodies have been found. We have worked with a journalist in Gaza to follow developments.\n\nPalestinian search teams say they have recovered hundreds of bodies\n\n“We’ve extracted martyrs, many of whom are decomposed and completely unidentifiable,” a Palestinian Civil Defence worker, Rami Dababesh told us grimly on 8 May as he stood by a line of white plastic body bags at al-Shifa, wearing a face mask and full protective gear. “We’ve found corpses of women, children and individuals without heads as well as torn body parts,” he added. The Civil Defence lacks forensic equipment and expertise, but its teams have been using photos and videos to document the remains. A director, Dr Mohamed Mughir, told us there were suspicious finds; describing how “signs of field executions, binding marks, gunshot wounds to the head and torture marks on the limbs were observed on the bodies of some martyrs\". The UN Security Council has expressed “deep concern” at the discovery of mass graves at both al-Shifa and Nasser hospital in southern Gaza. Along with the US and the European Union, it has called for an independent investigation into possible war crimes. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says that during its raids of the Gaza hospitals, its soldiers exhumed bodies that Palestinians had buried earlier as part of its search for the remains of some 250 hostages captured during the deadly Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October. It maintains bodies were examined respectfully and those not belonging to Israeli captives were returned to their place. However, at least some of the corpses found recently at al-Shifa were those of patients who died during Israel’s latest military action. A paramedic involved in the search said some had IV catheters still attached. On 15 April, the BBC met two men whose dead mothers were last seen being treated at the hospital. Their bodies had just been recovered from a mass grave. “I came running here when they told me of the grave,” said Mohammed al-Khatib, who had spent days searching for his mother, Khawla. “By the grace of almighty God her body was found.” Walid Fteima said his elderly mother, Lina Abu Leila, was being treated for malnutrition and severe dehydration when she died. Her body was decomposed, and he could only identify her from injuries she had from an Israeli bombing last year. “[She] had a toe amputated on each foot,” he explained. After it began its operation at the hospital early on 18 March, the IDF ordered thousands of civilians sheltering there and living in the vicinity to leave and head south. However, it said the hospital could continue to function. By the end of two weeks, only some 140 patients and medics reportedly remained.\n\nThe WHO's Dr Rik Peeperkorn said those left behind at the hospital ended up in facilities that were \"completely unfit for treatment\"\n\nThe local WHO representative, Dr Rik Peeperkorn, says this group endured “horrific conditions”. After being repeatedly moved around the complex, he says, they “actually ended up in the human resources building which was completely unfit for treatment\". Ultimately, he says, 20 patients died. Several surviving patients – all wounded in previous Israeli strikes – told us they were given only tiny quantities of food such as canned tuna. They said there were severe shortages of drinking water and medication. “The bombing surrounded us 24/7,” said Mohamed al-Nadeem who is half paralysed. “I am sick and unable to move. I was sleeping on the floor without blankets.” “There were no dressings or painkillers,” said Rafif Doghmush, 15, whose foot has been amputated. The IDF has told journalists that no staff or patients died as a “direct result” of its action, but that some may have died of “natural causes\". During its raid, it said it helped patients by moving them out of harm’s way and that medical supplies and devices as well as food, water, and a generator were brought to the hospital. Grainy drone footage shared by the IDF after it launched its raid on 18 March showed Palestinian gunmen apparently shooting at soldiers from inside al-Shifa hospital. Later, the gunmen were said to have barricaded themselves in wards and corridors, opening fire and throwing explosives. Three Israeli soldiers were confirmed to have been killed during the two-week long operation. The IDF briefed journalists that its action at the hospital was taken based on “concrete intelligence” that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad had taken over parts of the site, suggesting their operatives had been using it to access basic supplies as well as power and the internet.\n\nWhile Hamas denied using al-Shifa as a base, its officials did not deny the presence of some members inside the complex, indicating that they may have been among displaced people sheltering there. Israel has said that “over 200 terrorists” were killed in and around al-Shifa, as well as the hundreds detained, but has only given some names. These include Faiq al-Mabhouh, described as head of operations in Hamas’ internal security service. The Hamas-run government’s media office said he was a police commander who had been co-ordinating aid deliveries to northern Gaza. Others killed were identified as a senior Hamas commander, Raed Thabet, said to have been head of recruitment and supply acquisition, and Mahmoud Zakzouk, said to have been deputy commander of the Hamas rocket unit in Gaza City. Two other Hamas operatives were named as Fadi Dweik and Zakaria Najib, said to have been involved in organising attacks in the occupied West Bank. In April, the IDF also released footage which it said was from the interrogation of Tarek Abu Shaluf, spokesman for the political wing of Islamic Jihad. It said he had been captured at al-Shifa. Hamas and Islamic Jihad do not routinely confirm the names of low-level fighters killed by Israeli military action, making it very difficult to estimate how many were killed at the hospital and in the vicinity. It is likely that a number were among the dead found in mass graves.\n\nThere have repeatedly been conflicting narratives about what has happened in and around al-Shifa\n\nDespite the Israeli claim that there was “not a single civilian casualty” from its raid, we have been given strong testimony that there were Palestinian civilians killed by heavy Israeli bombardment and intense shooting in the surrounding neighbourhood. The Palestinian Civil Defence told us that hundreds of Palestinians were still reported to be missing following the raid in March. There have repeatedly been conflicting narratives about what has happened in and around al-Shifa. During its first controversial raid there, the Israeli military raised expectations that Israeli hostages might be found at the site. It also released a graphic depicting a vast underground tunnel network that it suggested was underneath the hospital, serving as a major Hamas command and control centre. While the IDF said it retrieved the bodies of two Israeli hostages near to the hospital, it did not announce that it had found any within the complex. Security camera footage that was recovered did show that at least two foreign captives were taken there on 7 October. The IDF showed what it said was a fortified 55-metre tunnel on the hospital grounds. This fell short of its initial claims about the extent of hidden tunnels, although later reporting suggested the passage – which was blown up – had actually been longer and was most likely connected to a wider network under Gaza City. When it returned to the site in March, the IDF suggested its key discoveries were of a different nature, releasing pi", "continuation": "ctures of cash, weapons, and ammunition it said it had found there along with Hamas documents.\n\nThe IDF says its forces discovered weapons and ammunition at the site\n\nAl-Shifa has been at the heart of a debate about whether Hamas uses medical sites as a cover. Israel has consistently claimed that the group hides its fighters and infrastructure behind the sick and wounded, which it suggests has rendered hospitals legitimate military targets. Hamas denies misusing civilian sites and accuses Israel of violating international humanitarian law by targeting hospitals. In April, when the UN called for “a clear, transparent and credible investigation” of mass graves in Gaza, its spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters that more journalists needed to be able to work safely in the territory to report on the facts. During the war, Israel and Egypt have denied free access to foreign media. Mr Dujarric also said: “It’s important that all forensic evidence be well preserved.” So far, that is proving to be a challenge. International forensic specialists have been unable to reach Gaza to investigate what happened at al-Shifa. That has left much of the focus locally on registering and identifying the dead where possible, and giving them proper burials. The disturbance of the mass grave sites, experts say, will ultimately make it much harder to uncover the truth about them. Meanwhile, although al-Shifa has been largely destroyed, there have been recent efforts to restart very limited medical services on site. These gained momentum as Israel targeted other health facilities which it said were being used by Hamas, particularly Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza. In late May, in a hastily repaired room of the kidney dialysis unit at al-Shifa, the journalist working with us met four patients as they sat connected to steadily beeping machines. After so many deaths at the hospital, it is once again providing some life-saving treatment."}

So it's just as well they also get tangled up in their fair share of mishaps, blunders and own goals every year. Here's a light-hearted look at some of 2024's biggest flops and fails.\n\nIt was supposed to be a triumphant return, but critics and fans complained Katy Perry's latest album 143 sounded dated and showed little artistic growth. The music video for Woman's World, which saw Perry join a group of dancers wearing tiny outfits on a construction site, was criticised for being regressive, although Perry later said it was supposed to be satirical. Matters were only made worse when the singer attracted the attention of the Spanish government for shooting the video for follow-up single Lifetimes in ecologically-sensitive sand dunes in the Balearic Islands. But many fans defended the album, which wasn't as bad as some reviews made out, and Perry's accompanying tour has been a huge success.\n\nThe sequel starred Joaquin Phoenix as Joker and Lady Gaga as Harlequin\n\nMaking a sequel to 2019's Joker, which grossed more than $1bn (£790m), was something Hollywood found simply irresistible. Unfortunately, the resulting film, Joker: Folie à Deux, was something audiences found entirely resistible. Making the film a musical was a bold swing, but the ton", "continuation": "al handbrake turn alienated the fans and critics who adored the Oscar-winning original. Folie à Deux managed to scrape over the $200m (£158m) mark, but that was barely enough to cover its production budget, let alone marketing costs. It wasn't the only movie flop of the year - audiences were also unenthusiastic about Madame Web, The Fall Guy, Kraven the Hunter, Megalopolis, Borderlands, Argylle, Unstoppable and Furiosa: A Mad Max Story.\n\nLiam and Noel Gallagher distanced themselves from the wildly unpopular dynamic pricing policy\n\nTicketmaster attracted a storm of controversy after making use of so-called \"dynamic pricing\" for UK dates on the Oasis reunion tour, which raised the cost of a ticket by £200 due to the predictable demand. Charging fans £350 per ticket was a dubious PR move for a band famous for their working class roots, and the Gallagher brothers wisely distanced themselves from the strategy. But Ticketmaster argued prices are set by artists and promoters. Dynamic pricing was later ditched for the band's US tour dates. Meanwhile, 50,000 fans who'd paid inflated prices on secondary platforms in order to secure tickets faced having them cancelled. A total omnishambles for everyone involved.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nWhen BBC weather presenter Kawser Quamer was asked in February about her plans for the weekend, she cheerfully explained she was attending her niece's surprise birthday party. Host Annabel Tiffin said that all sounded very lovely, but presumably the party was no longer a surprise, having just been announced on live TV. \"Oh goodness me,\" replied an alarmed Quamer, \"I've spoiled the surprise!\" The glorious mishap made its way across the Atlantic, going viral and featuring on Jimmy Kimmel Live. But Quamer handled it beautifully, and even managed to convince her niece, external she was talking about a different relative, keeping the surprise element intact.\n\nChaos is a term which could be applied to a lot of entries in this list, but one of the biggest casualties of the year was Kaos itself. Just a month after the first series of Jeff Goldblum's Greek mythology drama was released, Netflix announced it would not return for a second. Streamers can tell quickly if something is a hit or not by measuring viewing figures and completion rates. Their data even gives them the prospective ratings of the following months based on the first. But although fans campaigned for its return, ultimately Kaos was Kancelled.\n\nManchester's hottest new live venue finally opened this year, but only after several attempts. There was a string of cancellations due to various technical problems, including a ventilation unit falling from the ceiling. Shows by Peter Kay, Olivia Rodrigo, Take That and others were cancelled or moved, before the venue finally opened with a successful concert from rock band Elbow. The problems did at least bring one delightful moment: A Radio 4 newsreader announcing, external the delay of a gig by US rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie.\n\nPresident Biden ultimately stepped down, with Vice President Harris replacing him as the candidate\n\nFlops don't come much bigger than a debate performance which was so poor, it brought down an entire presidential campaign. Joe Biden seemed distant and frail when he took part in a televised live debate in June, struggling to finish some of his sentences and keep pace with Donald Trump. Biden tried to stay in the race, but the pressure on him became too high as figures including Democrat fundraiser George Clooney, external publicly called for him to stand down, leading to Kamala Harris replacing him as the candidate.\n\nZinedine Zidane was among the stars to feature in the Paris ceremony, but the event was hampered by rain\n\nA barnstorming performance from Celine Dion sadly wasn't enough to rescue this soggy croissant of an opening ceremony, which was badly hampered by rain. Organisers took the event outside of the traditional stadium setting and had performers spread out across Paris instead, which was both a security nightmare and challenging for spectators. The spread meant things felt somewhat disjointed and it was hard for the ceremony to build any momentum. Meanwhile, some viewers were upset by a scene involving drag queens which many interpreted as a reference to the Last Supper, but artistic director Thomas Jolly said was a reference to pagan gods.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nHot on the heels of the disastrous Willy Wonka experience was an unofficial Bridgerton ball, where fans of the Netflix series were invited to dress up and \"step into the enchanting world of the Regency era\". Unfortunately, they were greeted with disappointing food and drab decor, with one violinist and a pole dancer for entertainment. Creators blamed \"organisational challenges\" and said they \"sincerely apologised\". We anticipate the event being eviscerated in Lady Whistledown's next newsletter.\n\nThis year's Eurovision Song Contest was, frankly, a disaster from start to finish. A row about Israel's participation prompted security concerns, put all the entrants in an awkward position and even led to the head of Eurovision being booed during the grand final. Dutch singer Joost Klein was disqualified at the last minute due a backstage incident where a woman's video camera was knocked to the ground. Winner Nemo even accidentally broke the Eurovision trophy after placing it on stage, leaving the Swiss entrant with bandages after sustaining deep cuts to the thumb. Host city Malmo said they would refuse to stage the event again, external if Sweden won, saying they wouldn't have the \"strength and stamina\". And to top it all off, the UK languished in 18th place.\n\nLaura Kuenssberg withdrew from an interview with Boris Johnson in October after mistakenly sending her briefing notes to the former prime minister himself, resulting in what she called a few \"red faces\". ITV took over and Johnson later told BBC Radio 5 Live's Matt Chorley his originally scheduled interview had \"blown up on the launch pad\". Elsewhere, thousands of viewers complained to Ofcom in August when Home Secretary Yvette Cooper was interviewed on Good Morning Britain by her own husband, Ed Balls, about the violent unrest in parts of the UK. ITV's chief executive later noted it was a fluid news morning and the team had short notice that Cooper was coming on. She said the interview was impartial and fair but it wouldn't happen again.\n\nOn the plus side, Wynne Evans made a terrific Mrs Doubtfire\n\nAnother daytime presenter, Lorraine Kelly, became the subject of a viral X account which monitored her show attendance, external throughout the year (hovering just below 60%, if you're interested). Over on Strictly Come Dancing, which had already had a fairly appalling year before this series even started, fans were puzzled by some unusual on-screen encounters between singer Wynne Evans and his partner Katya Jones. Viewers spotted Jones apparently refusing to high-five Evans, and later moving his hand away from her waist. The show's welfare team checked in on them after concerns were raised, but the pair apologised for what they said was actually just a \"very silly inside joke\" between them.\n\nLizwani (second right) appeared with the Oppenheimer team as it was named the winner of best film\n\nWhen Oppenheimer was named best film at February's Baftas, the prize was collected by actor Cillian Murphy, director Christopher Nolan, producer Emma Thomas... and a random man standing silently in the background. The intruder was actually YouTuber Lizwani, who managed to infiltrate the event and make it all the way to the stage during the night's biggest moment. But the fact he was standing quietly and respectfully meant few viewers even noticed anything was wrong. Bafta have since tightened security. A month later, there was more awkwardness when Oppenheimer was named best picture at the Oscars, in an announcement fumbled by Al Pacino.\n\nPacino dispensed with the traditional \"And the Oscar goes to...\" Instead, he stumbled through proceedings before announcing, external somewhat abruptly: \"My eyes see Oppenheimer.\" There was a delayed reaction from the audience and orchestra, who weren't entirely sure if Pacino was finished or if they had heard the winner correctly. But Scarface redeemed himself later in the year by revealing his delightful Shrek phone cover,, external courtesy of his young daughter. All was forgiven.\n\nWhen Rishi Sunak called a general election in May, the then-prime minister made the announcement outdoors despite it bucketing with rain. Being in the open air also allowed an anti-Tory activist to disrupt the announcement by blasting music from a nearby speaker. But Sunak gamely stuck it out, later commenting that he was \"not a fair-weather politician\" and confirming he'd be taking an umbrella, external on the campaign trail.\n\nAdele mis-heard an audience member who she thought was saying something offensive\n\nLive tours and concerts were disrupted this year for all kinds of reasons. Jennifer Lopez cancelled her live shows after reports of poor ticket sales, external, although she said it was so she could spend time with family and friends. Tenacious D's tour fell apart after one member made some ill-advised comments about Donald Trump. And Madonna's fans became increasingly frustrated with her lateness. Elsewhere, Adele repeatedly swore at an audience member in Las Vegas who she thought had shouted \"Pride sucks\". It transpired the fan had actually shouted, external \"work sucks\" after the singer discussed her working week. Oops. So fair play to Kate Nash for not only keeping her show on the road, but funding her tour by selling pictures of her bottom online, helpfully bringing publicity to the issues of high tour costs and poor streaming royalties in the process.\n• None Indiana Jones to Twitter's rebrand: 15 celebrity flops and fails of 2023\n• None Batgirl to Wagatha: 15 celebrity flops and fails of 2022"}
{"context": "Greek coastguard threw migrants overboard to their deaths, witnesses say\n\nThe Greek coastguard has caused the deaths of dozens of migrants in the Mediterranean over a three-year period, witnesses say, including nine who were deliberately thrown into the water. The nine are among more than 40 people alleged to have died as a result of being forced out of Greek territorial waters, or taken back out to sea after reaching Greek islands, BBC analysis has found. The Greek coastguard told our investigation it strongly rejects all accusations of illegal activities. We showed footage of 12 people being loaded into a Greek coastguard boat, and then abandoned on a dinghy, to a former senior Greek coastguard officer. When he got up from his chair, and with his mic still on, he said it was \"obviously illegal\" and \"an international crime\". The Greek government has long been accused of forced returns - pushing people back towards Turkey, where they have crossed from, which is illegal under international law. But this is the first time the BBC has calculated the number of incidents which allege that fatalities occurred as a result of the Greek coastguard's actions. The 15 incidents we analysed - dated May 2020-23 - resulted in 43 deaths. The initial sources were primarily local media, NGOs and the Turkish coastguard. Verifying such accounts is extremely difficult - witnesses often disappear, or are too fearful to speak out. But in four of these cases we were able to corroborate accounts by speaking with eye witnesses. Our research, which features in a new BBC documentary, Dead Calm: Killing in the Med?, suggested a clear pattern.\n\nThis man from Cameroon told the BBC he was thrown into the sea by the coastguard - his two companions drowned\n\nIn five of the incidents, migrants said they were thrown directly into the sea by the Greek authorities. In four of those cases they explained how they had landed on Greek islands but were hunted down. In several other incidents, migrants said they had been put onto inflatable rafts without motors which then deflated, or appeared to have been punctured. One of the most chilling accounts was given by a Cameroonian man, who says he was hunted by Greek authorities after landing on the island of Samos in September 2021. Like all the people we interviewed, he said he was planning to register on Greek soil as an asylum seeker. \"We had barely docked, and the police came from behind,\" he told us. \"There were two policemen dressed in black, and three others in civilian clothes. They were masked, you could only see their eyes.\" He and two others - another from Cameroon and a man from Ivory Coast - were transferred to a Greek coastguard boat, he said, where events took a terrifying turn. “They started with the [other] Cameroonian. They threw him in the water. The Ivorian man said: ‘Save me, I don’t want to die'… and then eventually only his hand was above water, and his body was below. \"Slowly his hand slipped under, and the water engulfed him.\" Our interviewee says his abductors beat him. \"Punches were raining down on my head. It was like they were punching an animal.\" And then he says they pushed him, too, into the water - without a life jacket. He was able to swim to shore, but the bodies of the other two - Sidy Keita and Didier Martial Kouamou Nana - were recovered on the Turkish coastline. The survivor’s lawyers are demanding the Greek authorities open a double murder case.\n\nIn June 2023, an overloaded trawler flips in front of a Greek coast guard patrol boat. More than 600 men, women and children die in the water. But who is responsible, and are the coast guard at fault? Watch on iPlayer or on BBC Two at 21:00 on Monday 17 June.\n\nAnother man, from Somalia, told the BBC how in March 2021 he had been caught by the Greek army on arrival on the island of Chios, who then handed him to the Greek coastguard. He said the coastguard had tied his hands behind his back, before dropping him into the water. \"They threw me zip-tied in the middle of the sea. They wanted me to die,\" he said. He said he managed to survive by floating on his back, before one of his hands broke free from the ligature. But the sea was choppy, and three in his group died. Our interviewee made it to land where he was eventually spotted by the Turkish coastguard. Of the incidents we analysed, the one with the highest loss of life was in September 2022. A boat carrying 85 migrants ran into trouble near the Greek island of Rhodes when its motor cut out. Mohamed, from Syria, told us they rang the Greek coastguard for help - who loaded them onto a boat, returned them to Turkish waters and put them in life rafts. Mohamed says the raft he and his family were given had not had its valve properly closed. \"We immediately began to sink, they saw that… They heard us all screaming, and yet they still left us,\" he told the BBC. \"The first child who died was my cousin's son… After that it was one by one. Another child, another child, then my cousin himself disappeared. By the morning seven or eight children had died. \"My kids didn't die until the morning… right before the Turkish coastguard arrived.\"\n\nGreek law allows all migrants seeking asylum to register their claim on several of the islands at special registration centres. But our interviewees - who we contacted with the help of migrant support body Consolidated Rescue Group - said they were apprehended before they could get to these centres. They said these men would be apparently operating undercover - non-uniformed, and often masked. Human rights groups allege thousands of people seeking asylum in Europe have been illegally forced back from Greece to Turkey and denied the right to seek asylum, which is enshrined in international and EU law. Austrian activist Fayad Mulla told us he discovered for himself how secretive such operations seem to be in February last year, on the Greek island of Lesbos. Driving towards the location of an alleged forced return after a tip-off, he was stopped by a man in a hoodie - who was later revealed to work for the police. He said the police then attempted to delete the footage of him being stopped from his dashcam and charge him with resisting a police officer. Ultimately, no further action was taken.\n\nFayad Mulla's dashcam recorded the moment he was stopped by undercover police after he was tipped off about a forced return on Lesbos\n\nTwo months later, in a similar place, Mr Mulla managed to film a forced return, published by The New York Times. A group which included women and babies was unloaded from the back of an unmarked van and marched down a jetty onto a small boat. They were then transferred onto a Greek coastguard vessel further away from the coastline, taken out to sea, and then put onto a raft where they were left to drift. They were later rescued by the Turkish coastguard. We showed this footage - which the BBC has verified - to Dimitris Baltakos, the former head of special operations with the Greek coastguard. During the interview, he refused to speculate about what the footage showed - having denied, earlier in our conversation, that the Greek coastguard would ever be required to do anything illegal. But during a break, he was recorded telling someone out of shot in Greek: \"I haven't told them much, right? It's very clear, isn't it. It's not nuclear physics. I don't know why they did it in broad daylight… It's… obviously illegal. It's an international crime.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'It's obviously illegal' - moment former senior coastguard speaks off camera\n\nGreece's Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy told the BBC the footage is currently being investigated by the country's independent National Transparency Authority. An investigative journalist we spoke to based on the island of Samos says she began chatting with a member of the Greek special forces via the dating app Tinder. When he rang her from what he described as a \"warship\", Romy van Baarsen asked him more about his work - and what happened when his forces spotted a refugee boat. He replied that they \"drive them back\", and said such orders were \"from the minister\", adding they would be punished if they failed to stop a boat. Greece has always denied so-called “pushbacks” are taking place. Greece is an entryway into Europe for many migrants. Last year, there were 263,048 sea arrivals in Europe,, external with Greece receiving 41,561 (16%) of those. Turkey signed a deal with the EU in 2016 to stop migrants and refugees crossing into Greece, but said in 2020 it could no longer enforce it.\n\nJournalist Romy van Baarsen was told by a Greek special forces member that they are under government instruction to drive the boats back\n\nWe put the findings in our investigation to the Greek coastguard. It replied that its staff worked \"tirelessly with the utmost professionalism, a strong sense of responsibility and respect for human life and fundamental rights\", adding that they were \"in full compliance with the country's internatio", "continuation": "nal obligations\". It added: \"It should be highlighted that from 2015 to 2024, the Hellenic Coast Guard has rescued 250,834 refugees/migrants in 6,161 incidents at sea. The impeccable execution of this noble mission has been positively recognized by the international community.\" The Greek coastguard has previously been criticised for its role in the biggest migrant shipwreck in the Mediterranean for a decade. More than 600 people are feared to have died after the Adriana sank in Greece’s demarcated rescue area last June. Greek officials have insisted the boat was not in trouble and was safely on its way to Italy, and so the coastguard did not attempt a rescue."}
{"context": "No 'quick fix' for Tories, says Kemi Badenoch\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nTory leader Kemi Badenoch has insisted she will not be rushed into policy positions, claiming there is no \"quick fix\" following the party's defeat in July's general election. Badenoch became the party's sixth leader in less than nine years when she was elected at the start of November. In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said the public \"kicked out\" the Conservatives because the party was not trusted and did not deliver, adding building trust is \"something that takes a while\". Badenoch also dismissed concerns that her approach of not pinning down policy positions could leave a vacuum that might be filled by Reform UK.\n\nSpeaking to Amol Rajan, Badenoch said: \"Reform is saying stuff because it hasn't thought it all through. You can give easy answers if you haven't thought it all through. \"I do the thinking and what people are going to get with new leadership under me is thoughtful Conservatism, not knee-jerk analysis.\" \"We are about what we are for, not just what we are against,\" she said earlier in the interview. Badenoch said she would not \"rush out\" policy positions within six weeks and people would need to be \"patient\", but that she wanted to ensure people could believe she was telling the truth so she could earn their trust. In response, Reform leader Nigel Farage said the Conservative leader \"doesn't understand that the level of betrayal means that the Tory brand is broken. She personally bears heavy responsibility for this\". During the leadership contest, Badenoch deliberately avoided specific policy positions, focusing instead on Conservative \"principles\". But some in the party - including Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen - have warned against leaving a void on key issues such as migration that could be filled by Reform. Houchen told the BBC this month there was a \"big opportunity\" for the Tories because Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had \"left the field\" on the issue of migration, and called for the party to put forward a \"sensible narrative\".\n\nIn the interview, Badenoch acknowledged again that her party had \"let people down\" in the area of migration. She said the numbers were too high, having previously pledged to put a cap on arrivals into the UK – though she has not specified what level she would consider acceptable. Net migration hit a record in the year to June 2023 - with the difference between those arriving in the UK and leaving standing at 906,000 according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The net", "continuation": " figure dropped to 728,000 in the year to June 2024. The previous Conservative government's key migration policy was the Rwanda deportation scheme designed specifically to deter small boat crossings. No flights were able to take off to the east African country before July's election after numerous legal challenges, and Labour swiftly scrapped the scheme after winning power. The new government has focused on tackling the criminal gangs involved in people smuggling, with Sir Keir announcing an extra £75m to go to policing UK borders in November. At a press conference last month, Badenoch said the Conservatives still believed a \"deterrent\" was necessary but did not commit to a revival of the Rwanda scheme.\n\nIn the Today interview, Badenoch also acknowledged the local elections scheduled for May next year would be difficult for her party, but said it was a marathon not a sprint. She said: \"The Conservative Party is under changed leadership and I think that the voters will start to see that, but it's going to be slow and steady. It's the tortoise strategy, not the hare.\" A Labour spokesperson said: \"Every time Kemi Badenoch speaks it becomes clearer that she has no solutions to the problems the Tories created. \"Under her leadership, the Conservatives have made unfunded spending commitments worth billions without explaining how she would pay for any of them.\"\n\nFarage told the BBC last week that Reform was in \"open negotiations\" with US billionaire Elon Musk about donations to the party. Mr Musk will hold a role within the US government from January with President-elect Donald Trump appointing him as lead for the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). Asked whether she was concerned about the prospect of Mr Musk donating to Reform, Badenoch downplayed the possibility it would happen but said she \"believes in competition\". She said: \"So I think that if Elon Musk is giving a party, a competitor party money, then that is a challenge for me to make sure that I raise the same.\" She said it might be \"counterproductive\" for Reform, claiming people in the UK \"don't necessarily like to see politics being bought\"."}

{"context": "Labour has promised to overhaul the business rates system to help revitalise the High Street if elected in the UK general election. The party has not specified what will replace the current business rates system but said reforms would level the playing field for High Street firms against online rivals. The party first put forward a plan outlining how it wants to support Britain's small businesses back in November, external. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that \"hard-working small businesses have been held back\".\n\nBusiness rates are a tax on non-residential property such as pubs, restaurants, warehouses, factories, shops and offices. The amount businesses pay is based on how much annual rent could be charged on the premises - which is known as the rateable value. Central government has a significant degree of control over business rates in England, but they are collected by local councils. On Saturday, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC Labour \"want to reform the business rate system in a way that reduces the costs for small businesses and high streets, ensuring that some of the big multinationals and tech companies pay their fair share\". The party would also create \"banking hubs\" to ensure small business and customers have ready access to cash when on the High Street, Ms Reeves said. As part of a package of measures, Labour says it would stamp out the late payment of invoices via new legislation to force large businesses reveal their payment practices, as well as revitalising High Streets by cracking down on antisocial behaviour. Labour also plans new laws to allow smaller firms to qualify for public contracts. It is seeking to claim the mantle as the party of business, that’s traditionally associated with the Conservatives.

Ms Portas also praised plans to crack down on late payments as \"cash flow is vital\" to independent businesses. Previous research by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), external has suggested that more than half of small businesses it surveyed in 2022 had experienced late payments in the three previous months.

He pointed to previous measures taken by the government, such as freezing business rates for hospitality venues during the pandemic when trade was hit by lockdowns. Drew Hendry, the economy spokesperson for the SNP, suggested that Labour's plans were \"empty promises\" for Scottish small business owners. He added that the SNP had already established the Scottish National Investment Bank, but called for the removal of \"red tape, higher costs and worker visa blocks created by Brexit\".

At its annual conference starting on Monday, RCN boss Prof Nicola Ranger will say corridor care is \"a national emergency for patient safety\". The Conservatives said the NHS budget had increased by a third since 2010 and more community diagnostic centres had opened to ease the pressure on A&E. Labour said nurses were sounding the alarm because of 14 years of Conservative neglect, while the Lib Dems said they have an ambitious plan to fix the health crisis. In the RCN's report, the nursing union is calling for corridor care to be reported whenever it happens so that the problem can be eradicated everywhere in the UK. Its annual online survey of 11,000 nursing staff - out of a total of more than 700,000 in the UK - found one in three had witnessed patients being cared for in inappropriate places during their most recent shift. This figure has risen over the past two years.

And a BBC Newsnight investigation featured a patient who had spent three days on a corridor before being moved to a ward, and said his care had been \"horrendous\". However, some NHS bosses say so-called corridor care is freeing up ambulances and saving lives.\n\nThe waiting list for NHS treatments in England currently stands at 7.5 million. The Conservatives said thousands more permanent hospital beds had been created to free up capacity and cut waiting times. Health minister Andrew Stephenson said waiting lists for surgery and treatments had experienced the biggest six-month fall in 10 years outside the pandemic. \"We have boosted the budget by over a third in real terms since 2010, while the 160 community diagnostic centres we have opened across the country are delivering millions more scans, tests and checks to people outside of hospital settings to deliver more care closer to home,\" he added. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said only Labour had a plan to deliver change for the NHS. \"NHS nurses are sounding the alarm on the appalling state of the NHS after 14 years of Conservative neglect,\" he said. “Patients and staff alike can see that the NHS is broken. Only Rishi Sunak and his party won’t acknowledge that the crisis in the NHS is a national emergency, and if they can’t diagnose the illness then how can they be trusted to cure it.\" Lib Dem health spokesperson Daisy Cooper said the Conservatives had run the health service \"into the ground\". \"The Liberal Democrats have an ambitious plan to fix crumbling hospital buildings and provide everyone with the high-quality social care they deserve. This is at the heart of our offer to voters at this election and our plan to fix the health crisis.\"\n\nNHS waiting lists in Scotland have also reached a record high, with latest figures showing more than 690,000 waits for appointments or treatment for non-urgent care. A Scottish Government spokesperson said health boards were taking action to improve patient flow and reduce delays.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 8,000 children under the age of five have been diagnosed and treated for acute malnutrition since the war began - of those 1,600 were severe cases. Last week, WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there had “already been 32 deaths attributed to malnutrition, including 28 among children under five\". At the beginning of June, the UN’s children’s agency, Unicef, reported that nine out of 10 children in Gaza were experiencing severe food poverty, surviving on two or fewer food groups per day. It said that “months of hostilities and restrictions on humanitarian aid have collapsed the food and health systems, resulting in catastrophic consequences” and that children were “at risk of life-threatening malnutrition\".\n\nAbdulaziz's mother says she can’t get the food he needs in Gaza\n\nI was born in Gaza and lived there with my family - I reported from there until February. Before the war, I knew northern Gaza’s al-Tufah district as a bustling place with thousands of shoppers. But when I call people still there to ask about conditions, they send me pictures showing it is now nearly deserted. “There are no tomatoes, no cucumbers, no fruit, and no bread,” says Salim Shabaka, an elderly man at the market. He tells me only some used clothes and a limited supply of canned foods are on display. “We have never known life like this - nothing to buy or sell,” adds another street vendor. “I have seven children and have not received any aid.” Every day, long queues form in front of “Tikkeyas” - small food stalls providing free meals. Many have been funded by better-off individuals in northern Gaza, but the shortage of supplies means their future is uncertain. For now, this is where some children go to try to get a hot meal, while others walk long distances to fetch water.\n\nOnce a bustling place with thousands of shoppers, northern Gaza’s al-Tufah district is now nearly deserted\n\nAlmost every day, I speak to relatives and friends in Gaza. In the pictures they send me I can see they have lost weight and I notice the change in their faces. And Dr Tedros at the WHO has warned that \"despite reports of increased delivery of food, there is currently no evidence that those who need it most are receiving sufficient quantity and quality of food\". He added that, due to insecurity and lack of access, only two stabilisation centres for severely malnourished patients could currently op", "continuation": "erate. He warned that the lack of health services, clean water and sanitation “significantly increases the risk of malnourished children\". The situation means the spread of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis, is also more likely. Most hospitals and clinics are closed, and those still operating are damaged and overcrowded. “We are drained and out of energy,” says Umm Fouad Jaber, an elderly woman from Jabalia, in northern Gaza. “We have been displaced several times, and people are being killed every day.\" “We have eaten animal food, and children and women pass out because of malnutrition. Diseases have eaten our bodies.” Palestinian doctor Moatasem Saed Salah, a member of the emergency committee at the Hamas-run health ministry, confirms that dozens of cases of malnutrition are reported every day, especially among children and pregnant and breastfeeding women. He says many people, already suffering from chronic diseases, are now struggling with other health conditions too.\n\nThe war began after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 37,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, and many hundreds of thousands more have been injured or displaced. Gazans have looked to humanitarian aid to survive, but not enough supplies are getting through.\n\nAt one point, the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border in the south of Gaza was the main point of entry for aid. But with Israel now controlling the Gaza side of the crossing, it is closed. Also in the south is the Kerem Shalom gateway from Israel. It is open, but fighting has restricted the flow of aid along this route. Some food is also being shipped to the north through new crossing points, but the volume of aid has dropped by two-thirds since 7 May, according to UN figures, and supplies are dwindling in the south, according to the World Food Programme. A US-built floating pier for aid shipments was out of operation for days after being damaged by bad weather, and has since been temporarily moved due to high seas. Twenty international aid agencies warned that the \"unpredictable trickle of aid into Gaza has created a mirage of improved access while the humanitarian response is on the verge of collapse\". Last week, Gaza’s Hamas-run government reported that no more than 35 lorries were arriving in Gaza each day, and said these are the only source of food and medicine for 700,000 people in north Gaza. But in a post on X on 13 June, the Israeli body responsible for humanitarian co-ordination, Cogat, said: “Over one billion pounds of food were transferred to Gaza since the start of the war. “There is no limit to the [a]mount of humanitarian aid, including all kinds of medicines that can enter Gaza.” In another post on the same day Cogat said 220 aid lorries had entered Gaza that day. It blames aid agencies for logistical failures in distributing food and other supplies, and says more than 1,300 aid lorries are still waiting to be collected. The UN says distribution of what does get through is severely hampered by fighting, the breakdown of law and order, and other Israeli restrictions. On Sunday, the Israeli military announced daily \"tactical pauses of military activity\" along a road in southern Gaza to allow more humanitarian aid to enter. But it emphasised that there was no ceasefire and that combat would continue in Rafah. Israel says its operation in Rafah is necessary to oust Hamas from what it calls the group's “last major stronghold”. These pauses, which were said to have begun on Saturday, will be from 08:00 to 19:00 local time (05:00 to 16:00 GMT) and will only affect a route leading northwards from the Kerem Shalom crossing. A UN spokesperson welcomed the announcement but on Sunday noted it hadn't yet increased aid on the ground. UN agencies earlier warned that if hostilities continued, more than one million Palestinians in Gaza could face severe starvation by mid-July."}

Eid Sabbah, head of the nursing department at Kamal Adwan hospital, told the BBC that at about 07:00 on Friday, the military gave the administration 15 minutes to evacuate patients and staff into its courtyard. Israeli troops subsequently entered the hospital and were removing the remaining patients, he said. The Israeli military said on Friday afternoon that it was carrying out an operation in the area of the hospital, which it called a \"Hamas terrorist stronghold\".\n\nIsraeli troops had \"facilitated the secure evacuation of civilians, patients and medical personnel\" from the hospital before beginni", "continuation": "ng the operation, it added. The military did not say where the patients would be moved. But earlier in the week, an Israeli official said that they intended to relocate those at Kamal Adwan hospital to the nearby Indonesian hospital, which was itself evacuated by the military on Tuesday. Dr Sabbah said \"it's dangerous because there are patients in the ICU department in a coma and in need of ventilation machines and moving them will put them in danger\". \"If the army intends to continue removing these patients, they will need specialised vehicles.\" Dr Yousef Abu-Al Rish, Gaza's deputy minister of health, later told the BBC that patients in a serious condition had been taken to the Indonesian hospital, which he said is not functioning due to there being no generators or water. \"You can't call it a hospital, it's more of a shelter. It's not equipped for patients,\" Dr Abu-Al Rish said. The World Health Organization said the raid \"has put this last major health facility in north Gaza out of service\". \"Initial reports indicate that some key departments were severely burnt and destroyed during the raid,\" it posted on X on Friday evening. Nadav Shoshani, international spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said in a post on Friday evening on X that a \"small fire broke out in an empty building inside the hospital that is under control\". This was when IDF troops were not inside the hospital, he said, adding that \"after preliminary examination, no connection was found between IDF activity to the fire\". It comes hours after the director of Kamal Adwan hospital said that approximately 50 people had been killed, including five medical staff, in a series of Israeli air strikes targeting the vicinity of the hospital. The statement from Dr Hussam Abu Safiya said a building opposite the hospital was targeted by Israeli warplanes, leading to the death of a paediatrician and a lab technician, as well as their families. He said a third staff member who worked as a maintenance technician was targeted and killed as he rushed to the scene of the first strike. Two of the hospital's paramedics were 500m (1,640ft) away from the hospital when they were targeted and killed by another strike, the statement continued, with their bodies remaining in the street with no-one able to reach them. The Israeli military said on Friday morning that it was \"unaware of strikes in the area of Kamal Adwan hospital\" and was looking into the reports that staff had been killed. Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia has been under a tightening Israeli blockade imposed on parts of northern Gaza since October, when the military said it had launched an offensive to stop Hamas from regrouping there. The UN has said the area is under a \"near-total siege\" as the Israeli military heavy restricts access of aid deliveries to an area where an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people remain. In recent days, the hospital's administrators have issued desperate pleas appealing to be protected, as they say the facility has become regularly the target of Israeli shelling and explosives. Oxfam said that attempts by aid agencies to deliver supplies to the area since October had been unsuccessful because of \"deliberate delays and systematic obstructions\" by the Israeli military."}

{"context": "Israeli troops have taken up positions on Mt Hermon, also known as Jabal al-Sheikh\n\nAfter launching hundreds of air strikes on Syrian military assets and seizing positions including the summit of a mountain with an uninterrupted sightline to the capital Damascus, Israel appears to be taking advantage of what it sees as a unique moment of opportunity. Syrian command structures were in disarray, with key positions apparently left unmanned after the fall of the Assad regime. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says its air force and navy have conducted more than 350 strikes since Saturday night, taking out an estimated 70-80% of Syrian strategic military assets from Damascus to Latakia. They included fighter aircraft, radar and air defence sites, and naval ships, as well as weapons stockpiles, the IDF said. \"The navy operated last night to destroy the Syrian fleet with great success,\" said Defence Minister Israel Katz. The IDF has also moved ground forces east from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights into a demilitarised buffer zone in Syria and, it now admits, just beyond. Katz said he had told the military to \"establish a sterile defence zone free of weapons and terrorist threats in southern Syria, without a permanent Israeli presence\".\n\nOne Israeli commentator said the past 72 hours had \"stood out even for people who thought they had already seen everything\". \"It didn't strip the Syrian military of specific capabilities only - it sent it back to the starting line, bereft of any significant strategic capabilities,\" wrote Yoav Limor in the Israel Hayom newspaper. \"The IDF operation to destroy Syria's military capabilities is the largest it has ever undertaken,\" commented Udi Etzion on the Walla news site.\n\nThe IDF said it had carried out more than 350 air strikes on Syria in the space of two days\n\nFormer Israeli Air Force officers commented in online posts that some of the attacks carried out as part of this operation were based on plans drawn years ago. One military analyst said that some targets were already identified by Israel in the mid-1970s. Meanwhile, troops have taken control of positions in the Golan, including the top of Mt Hermon, according to Israeli media. In Arabic, the mountain is known as Jabal al-Sheikh. \"The territory guarantees strategic control over the whole southern Syrian arena, which generates an immediate threat to Israel,\" the Ynet news website quoted Kobi Michael, a researcher at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), as saying. \"There is no higher vantage point than the Syrian part of the Golan.\"\n• None What is the Golan heights?\n\nOfficials stress that Israel has been acting in its own national security interests following the collapse of the Assad regime. They say the aim is to stop weapons that the regime held falling into the wrong hands – whether Syrian extremist factions or its old foe, the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. Hezbollah and its backer, Iran, were close allies of Assad, helping him to prop him up in office during the long civil war in Syria. \"We will not allow an extreme Islamic terrorist entity to act against Israel beyond its border, putting its citizens at risk,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video message on Tuesday.\n\nSyria and Israel fought against each other in the Middle East Wars of 1948, 1967 and 1973 and formally regard each other as enemy states. Under Bashar al-Assad, Syria was a significant regional military power. Israel had attacked it in recent years in hundreds of strikes that were rarely openly acknowledged. Israel's calculation included a sphere of deniability for itself but also for Assad so he would not feel forced to respond. These had focused on preventing transfer of weapons to Hezbollah, as the main transport route was overland from Syria to Lebanon, arms manufacturing, and Syrian air defence systems, which posed a threat to Israeli warplanes sent on missions.\n\nIsrael avoided major attacks that could have led to wider war and sought to avoid conflict with Russia, after it became Assad's biggest supporter in recent years. Some defence analysts suggest that Israel wanted to avoid weakening the Syrian regime for fear of triggering the chaos that could follow if its opponents seized power. Over the years, Israel and Syria - under its secular, Baathist regime - stuck to well-defined red lines; it was a known adversary. But the speedy advance of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) prompted a hastily developed new Israeli strategy.\n\nUN peacekeepers remain in the buffer zone established in Syrian territory following", "continuation": " the 1973 Middle East War and have stressed that by moving its ground forces in, Israel is now in violation of the ceasefire agreement which set it up. Israeli officials argue that the ceasefire agreement has now collapsed, as the other party to the agreement ceased to exist, and that its moves are temporary and limited for self-defence. A UN peacekeeping spokesperson said peacekeepers were \"unable to move freely within the buffer zone following recent events\", adding that it was \"imperative that the UN peacekeepers are allowed carry out their mandated tasks without hindrance\". \"We're against these types of attacks. I think this is a turning point for Syria. It should not be used by its neighbours to encroach on the territory of Syria,\" UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, Iraq and the Arab League have all issued official statements, with several presenting it as a land grab made by taking advantage of recent events, and a violation of Syria's sovereignty and international law.\n\nIsraeli forces have been operating inside the demilitarised buffer zone in Syria and just beyond\n\nFrance and Germany have also criticised Israeli actions, with France demanding Israel withdraw troops from the buffer area and Germany warning Israel along with Turkey to Syria's north not to jeopardise the chances of a peaceful transition in Syria. \"We must not allow the internal Syrian dialogue process to be torpedoed from the outside,\" said Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. The US has urged Israel to ensure its incursion is \"temporary\". Among Israelis however there has been broad public support for the country's pre-emptive actions. Several media outlets are stressing the potential danger posed by Syria's new Islamist leaders, with HTS still widely designated as a terrorist organisation. In the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, Amihai Attali congratulated Israel's military and political establishments, saying they had learnt a valuable lesson from the deadly Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023, which caught the country off guard. \"One of the most important lessons of the invasion, massacre and mass-kidnappings is that we cannot afford the privilege of trying to interpret enemy intentions,\" he wrote. \"We can't afford to make mistakes on that front.

He helped them reach the 2024 World Series, which they lost 4-1 to the LA Dodgers. The Yankees, according to the MLB, made a $760m (£595m) offer over 16 years to re-sign Soto but were outbid by the Mets. Soto had a 0.288 batting average in 157 regular-season games last season, having hit a career-high 41 home runs and 109 runs batted in (RBI) - awarded every time you enable someone, including yourself, to score. In the World Series he had a 0.313 batting average, with one home run and one RBI. Soto played for the Washington Nationals and San Diego Padres before joining the Yankees. He helped the Nationals cause an upset in his first full season when they beat the Houston Astros to win the 2019 World Series.

He also said Ukraine would need to officially give up in its efforts to join the Nato military alliance for the Russian advance to be halted. Mr Putin said: \"As soon as Kyiv declares that it is ready for such a decision... an order to cease fire and begin negotiations will immediately follow from our side, literally at the same minute.\" Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called the proposal a \"complete sham\" and \"offensive to common sense\". Later on Friday, President Zelensky told Italy's Sky TG24 television: \"These messages are ultimatum messages. It's the same thing Hitler did, when he said 'give me a part of Czechoslovakia and it'll end here'.\" US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin also dismissed the Russian demands, saying: \"Putin has illegally occupied sovereign Ukrainian territory. \"He is not in any position to dictate to Ukraine what they must do to bring about a peace.\" Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Mr Putin's proposal was \"not made in good faith\".\n\nRussia analyst Tatiana Stanovaya said Mr Putin's plan is a set of \"maximalist\" demands that offer no concessions, timed to devalue the peace conference ahead of it beginning. Mr Zelensky will be attending Saturday's summit near Lake Lucerne, where he will hope to show he still enjoys wide international support. The Swiss government has said the aim of the summit is \"to provide a forum where world leaders discuss paths towards a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, based on international law and the UN Charter\". Other attendees will include US Vice-President Kamala Harris, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Russia was not invited and China has said it will not attend without Russia's presence. The peace summit comes after G7 leaders agreed to use interest from frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine fight invading Russian forces. Some $325bn (£256bn) worth of assets were frozen by G7 countries, alongside the EU, following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The pot of assets is generating about $3bn a year in interest. Under the G7 plan, that $3bn will be used to pay off the annual interest on a $50bn loan for the Ukrainians, taken out on the international markets. The money is not expected to arrive until the end of the year but is seen as a longer-term solution to support Ukraine's war effort and economy. On the sidelines of the G7 summit, the US and Ukraine also signed a 10-year bilateral security deal, hailed by Kyiv as \"historic\"."}

One25 has increased its outreach service to seven nights a week because of the demand and says some women are returning to the trade out of necessity. Between 2022-2023 135 women were supported through the outreach project, compared to 94 in 2021-2022 - a 44% rise. Clare (not her real name) worked on the streets for more than 10 years and said it was a \"really scary\" experience.\n\nClare credits One25 with helping her turn her life around\n\nShe ended up selling sex after her baby was taken into care and was also addicted to drugs during that time. Recalling an incident when she was attacked, she explained: \"One time a guy took me further than what I would've liked....my intent was to get out the car, pretend I needed a wee and run away but he ran after me and raped me. \"I thought he was going to kill me....it is so scary because there is nobody there to help you.\" Clare says the weeks and months rolled into one and she described herself as a \"walking zombie\", often sleeping in car parks or on the streets. She credits One25 with helping her turn her life around, saying they saved her and she is no longer selling sex.\n\nRachel Collins-White is the operations manager for One25, which runs several different projects for street sex workers, including the outreach van. The charity believes the increase in women seeking their help since 2021 is due to a number of reasons. \"We w", "continuation": "ork with some of the most marginalised women in Bristol so already you've got a lot of complex needs there and that's further been compounded by the pandemic and cost of living crisis. \"Difficulties with access to healthcare, housing and trauma support are some of the reasons there may have been an increase in women working on the street,\" she added.\n\nRachel Collins-White says difficulties with access to healthcare, housing and trauma support may be behind the increase\n\nThe outreach van offers a range of support including food, hot drinks, condoms, harm reduction packs and a friendly face. \"Some women might come on for just a hot chocolate - and then the next woman that comes on might have just been the victim of a serious assault....she knows she can come onto the van and we will check she's safe. \"We're taking our support out to the women, and they can then choose if they access that, but it is our first attempt to reach out to women. \"From there it might be they feel able to come to our other services quite quickly, but it can take weeks, months, or even years.\" The charity said it has seen new women, some who had previously exited street working, returning and some who are now using it more frequently as well.\n\nThe number of women selling sex on the streets has risen, the charity says\n\nElsewhere, Streetlight UK is an organisation supporting women in parts of London, Sussex and Surrey. It offers a similar outreach van service, and has seen a similar increase in women selling sex on the streets. Helena Croft is the chief executive of the charity. \"On-street work is definitely growing, and I would say, the thing that we've noticed the most is that all the needs of the women are exacerbated. \"So the alcohol and substance abuse is worse, the homelessness is worse, the mental health problems are worse. \"We're seeing an increase in all the vulnerabilities, and in all the challenges that our services are trying to overcome.\" She hopes going forward the public narrative around women selling sex on the streets can change, and also thinks a change in the law could make a difference. \"At the moment the burden of the law sits very squarely on the women, and they're the easy targets. \"They're the ones that it's easy for the police to arrest. \"We would like to see the enhanced version of the Nordic model come into the UK where buying sex is criminalised.\"\n\nClare has now stopped working on the street and got clean from her addiction to drugs too. She said that when she first sought help from One25 she was at her \"wits' end\" and felt depressed and suicidal. \"They opened my eyes to a world that is foreign to me....the normal everyday things - people getting up and doing 9-5 jobs...just normal everyday life...I was seen and I was heard and I was helped.\" Reflecting on how much has changed in the last few years she said she is \"amazed\" at how far she has come. \"I always thought that life would haunt me forever and my life has flourished and I'm very grateful (to One25) and appreciate everything they've done and still do for me now.\""}

The 83-year-old faces 34 charges over alleged incidents between 2001 and 2019, including 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault. Mr Jones is one of Australia's most influential media figures and a former coach of its national rugby union team. He has previously denied allegations of abuse, first published by The Sydney Morning Herald in 2023. After appearing in court, he spoke publicly for the first time since his arrest last month, saying: \"I have never indecently assaulted these people.\"\n\n\"I ", "continuation": "want you to understand this: these allegations are all either baseless or they distort the truth, and you should know that prior to my arrest I was given no opportunity by police to answer any of these allegations.\" Mr Jones was taken into custody at his Sydney apartment on 18 November, as detectives from the New South Wales (NSW) Police Child Abuse Squad searched the harbour-front property and seized electronic devices. Originally charged in relation to eight people - including a 17-year-old boy - police have since filed additional charges, and say investigations are continuing. All the charges, except two of common assault, are sex offences. Police said some of the alleged victims knew the radio and TV host personally, and that at least one had been employed by him. Others were allegedly assaulted the first time they met him, NSW Police's Michael Fitzgerald told reporters last month. \"The law assumes that I am not guilty, and I am not guilty,\" Mr Jones told the media scrum waiting for him after his first court appearance in Sydney on Wednesday. \"That's all I can say at the moment, but I am emphatic that I'll be defending every charge before a jury in due course.\" A former teacher, Mr Jones coached the Wallabies between 1984 and 1988, before pivoting to a radio career. He also, at times, worked as a speechwriter and advisor for Liberal Party figures - including former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser - and launched several failed bids to represent the party in both state and federal politics. A staple of Sydney airwaves on local station 2GB for decades, Mr Jones juggled those duties with TV commentary gigs before he retired from full time work in 2020 citing health issues. The broadcaster is a polarising figure, for years boasting one of the nation's biggest audiences but often courting controversy. He made headlines in 2012 for suggesting that then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard's father had \"died of shame\", and in 2019 faced a massive advertiser boycott after saying someone should \"shove a sock\" down the throat of New Zealand's leader at the time, Jacinda Ardern."}

Mr Mangione faces various charges, including first-degree murder, and two counts of second-degree murder, one of which describes the killing as an act of \"terrorism\", Bragg said. \"The intent was to sow terror,\" New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg said, calling the shooting a \"frightening, well-planned and targeted murder\". Mr Mangione is scheduled to appear for a court hearing on 19 December over whether he will be extradited to New York on the charges, though Mr Bragg suggested the suspect may not fight extradition.\n\n\"We have indications the defendant may waive that hearing,\" Mr Bragg said. The extradition proceeding is scheduled for the same day as Mr Mangione's preliminary hearing on gun-related charges in Pennsylvania. Appearing at a press conference Tuesday afternoon, both Mr Bragg and New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch lambasted the public for praising Mr Mangione in the wake of the 4 December shooting. \"In the nearly two weeks since Mr Thompson's killing, we have seen a shocking and appalling celebration of cold-blooded murder,\" Ms Tisch said. \"We don't celebrate murders and we don't lionise the killing of anyone.\" In addition to murder, the suspect also faces weapons and forgery charges. If he is convicted on the most serious charges placed against him - first degree murder and second degree murder as an act of terrorism - Mr Mangione could face life in prison without the possibility of parole. Asked about the specific terrorism charges, Mr Bragg replied that \"in its most basic terms, this was a killing that was intended to evoke terror\". Five days after Mr Thompson, the UnitedHealthcare CEO, was shot and killed, Mr Mangione was arrested at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, with a fake ID and so-called \"ghost gun\", police said. His lawyer, Thomas Dickey, has said he has not seen evidence that links Mr Mangione's gun with the crime. New York prosecutors began to share evidence in their case against Mr Mangione with a grand jury last week. If extradited, the 26-year-old is likely to be held at Riker's Island or another New York prison.\n\nThe evidence against Mr Mangione includes a positive match of his fingerprints with those discovered at the crime scene, Commissioner Tisch said. According to District Attorney Bragg, the suspect arrived in New York City on 24 November, staying in a Manhattan hostel using a fake ID before carrying out the attack against Mr Thompson 10 days later. In addition to the ghost gun - a gun assembled from untraceable parts - and fake ID, a", "continuation": " passport and a handwritten document indicating \"motivation and mindset\" also were found on Mr Mangione when he was arrested, police said. During Tuesday's news conference announcing the New York charges, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny also described an interaction with the suspect's mother, who in November filed a missing person report for her son in San Francisco. After the manhunt for the shooting suspect had begun, that report was flagged to authorities, who contacted Mr Mangione's mother. According to Mr Kenny, his mother said she did not identify her son as the suspect, but said \"it might be something that she could see him doing\". Mr Mangione was formally charged in Pennsylvania with forgery, carrying firearms without a licence, tampering with records or identification, possessing instruments of crime and providing a false identification to police. While Mr Mangione awaits his fate in the New York court system, he remains under maximum security at Huntingdon State Correctional Institution in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser."}

UK housebuilder Crest Nicholson was forced to issue a profit warning after it said sales momentum had softened since Easter due to volatile mortgage rates as well as buyers now expecting borrowing costs to drop later this year. Meanwhile, a survey of chartered surveyors found that demand for homes had weakened in May. Financial markets are forecasting that the Bank of England could cut interest rates in August or September.\n\nCrest Nicholson reported a pre-tax loss of £30.9m for the six months to the end of April, including the impact of exceptional costs, compared to a £28.4m profit over the same period last year. The housebuilder said that while \"the spring selling season started well\", it added: \"Momentum has softened slightly since Easter, reflecting the volatility in mortgage rates and the expectation of a base rate reduction coming later in the year than previously expected.\" It added: \"The imminent general election is creating some short-term uncertainty, but this is anticipated to be alleviated in July once the outcome is known.\" The firm now expects adjusted full-year profits of between £22m to £29m. Analysts had expected the company to announce profits of around £38m. Crest Nicholson's share price tumbled by nearly 12% to 212.4p.\n\nA survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) found that demand had weakened in May. Tarrant Parsons, senior economist at RICS, said a recent recovery in the housing market \"appears to have slipped into reverse of late\" which he blamed on higher mortgage rates in the past couple of months.

{"context": "Beaumont to be interim RFU chair as Ilube steps down\n\nSir Bill Beaumont's eight-year stint as chair of World Rugby came to an end last month\n\nTom Ilube has stepped down as Rugby Football Union chairman amid controversy over the organisation's executive bonuses, with Sir Bill Beaumont appointed as interim chair. Ilube's departure pre-empted the possibility of a grassroots rebellion forcing him out over the scale of bonuses. Former World Rugby chair Beaumont, 72, has stepped in pending the appointment of a permanent replacement. Ilube, who was appointed in August 2021, faced the possibility of a vote of no confidence in his leadership as a motion to sack him gathered support among England's community clubs. However, a group of co-opted members of the RFU Council - appointed to make the governing body more inclusive - have expressed their \"anger and distress\" Ilube has been \"forced out\", blaming \"bullying, entitlement and elitism\". In a scathing email sent to the Council's full membership on Friday - and seen by the BBC - they claimed the game had \"lost a champion of our sport and importantly for us all, a leader in diversity of thought and lived experience\". Ilube was England's first black chair of a major sport. The RFU chairman is the only permanent member of the body's remuneration committee which oversees the pay awarded to all employees on a basic salary of more than £180,000 a year. \"I have decided to step down from my role as chair of the RFU as recent events have become a distraction from the game but will stay on to ensure a smooth transition to a new chair as soon as one is in place,\" said Ilube, 61. Beaumont, a Grand Slam-winning England captain in his playing days, said: \"I am honoured to be taking on the role on an interim basis and would like to pay tribute to the great work and passion of Tom Ilube. \"We now must look forward and I hope I can help to unite the game and drive forward the game of ru", "continuation": "gby in England at both an international level and in the community game.\" The RFU's latest accounts, published in November, revealed chief executive Bill Sweeney had been paid a total of £1.1m as the organisation posted record losses. Sweeney was paid £430,000 in 2020 - his first full year in the role - when he took a voluntary 20% pay cut for three months and opted not to take a bonus to limit financial pressure during the pandemic. However, a three-year incentive plan put in place in 2021, which offered the possibility of large rewards if the RFU's performance hit certain goals, sent his pay to seven figures. The RFU's record losses came two months after it announced its latest round of redundancies.\n\nBill Sweeney (left) and Tom Ilube (right) at the unveiling of England men's head coach Steve Borthwick in 2022\n\nThe RFU Council - which represents the national game to the union's executive - has instigated an \"immediate, independent review\" into the incentive plan, which it said had done \"reputational damage to the sport over the past month\". \"I'm pleased that an independent review of the LTIP (long-term incentive plan) scheme has been commissioned and look forward to its findings once completed,\" added Ilube. \"It has been an honour to chair the RFU and I look forward to once again enjoying the game that I grew up with from the touchline and watching it grow.\" In the wake of Ilube's resignation, four co-opted Council members - Matt Webb, Yemi Gbajobi, Roxy Fearon and Garnet Mackinder - sent a email to the full body, saying: \"We are particularly concerned by comments and behaviours of fellow council members. \"This has felt, in no small way, like a mob out to make a point and assert authority. \"The RFU has lost a highly professional and passionate leader, who has been forced out because he does not fit the mould expected by those individuals and the echo chamber they move in. The change and uncertainty this brings is detrimental to the game. \"We as co-opted members of the Council, are deeply concerned that the recent actions set back the ability of the RFU and Council to deliver on the change it proclaims to seek\". They added their \"faith\" in the Council to be a \"a pro-actively inclusive environment, open to leaders for our game who bring different experiences and expertise to help our sport evolve and attract new participants, is severely diminished\". Ilube and Sweeney met RFU president Rob Udwin on Thursday to \"agree a way forward\". In an email to councillors on Friday - seen by BBC Sport - Udwin said he was \"sorry it had come to this\" regarding Ilube's resignation, adding that the crisis was a \"fast-moving situation\". Proposers of a motion to remove Ilube and Sweeney have claimed they have enough support to force a vote of no confidence by the end of February. A two-thirds majority would have been required to force Ilube from his role and will be needed to request the directors dismiss Sweeney. Beaumont's appointment is still to be ratified by the RFU Council. The Community Clubs Union - a group of grassroots clubs campaigning for change - said it was \"delighted\" Ilube had left his role, but that the appointment of Beaumont was \"equally frustrating\" and it remains \"highly concerned at the governance and accountability still within English Rugby\". It said it would be writing to Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy to \"ask for her help in pushing for change that will benefit the whole game of rugby union\".\n\nGiven the backlash from various parts of the game since the release of the RFU annual report almost four weeks ago, Ilube's position had been under scrutiny to the point of being untenable. Ilube joined the union to much fanfare in 2021 given his highly impressive CV but he ended up being fairly inconspicuous in the role. It's hard to remember an RFU chair who kept such a low public profile. The RFU board met on Friday morning with chief executive Bill Sweeney's position still under the microscope. However RFU sources have told BBC Sport that Sweeney continues to have the full support of the board."}

Australian-born Mr Murdoch, who has six children, is chairman emeritus of News Corporation, which owns Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the Sun and the Times. He stepped down as chairman of Fox and News Corp last year, leaving his son Lachlan to head both companies.\n\nThe pair were wed at a ceremony", "continuation": " at Rupert Murdoch's Californian vineyard\n\nMr Murdoch and Ms Zhukova are said to have met at a party hosted by one of his ex-wives, Chinese-born entrepreneur Wendi Deng. His other former spouses are Australian flight attendant Patricia Booker, Scottish-born journalist Anna Mann, and US model and actress Jerry Hall. Ms Zhukova was previously married to Russian oil billionaire Alexander Zhukov, while their daughter Dasha - a socialite and businesswoman - was married to the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich until 2017. Rupert Murdoch began his career in Australia in the 1950s - eventually buying the News of the World and the Sun newspapers in the UK in 1969. He later purchased a number of US publications including the New York Post and Wall Street Journal. In 1996, he launched Fox News - now the most-watched TV news channel in the US. Through News Corp, which was founded in 2013, Mr Murdoch remains the owner of hundreds of local, national and international media outlets. His career has not been without controversy. One of his most damaging moments was the notorious UK phone-hacking scandal that erupted after it emerged that the News of the World had listened to murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler's voicemails. Last September, Mr Murdoch announced he was stepping back from the leading role in his media empire - handing the reins to his son Lachlan and later taking on the role of Chairman Emeritus of both Fox and News Corp."}

Watch: The insurgent Arakan Army video of their capture of the barracks\n\nThe end, when it came for the BGP5 barracks, was loud and brutal. First, a crackly speaker calling out for their surrender; then, a thunderous barrage of artillery, rockets and rifle fire that tore chunks out of the buildings in which hundreds of soldiers were hiding. BGP5 – the letters stand for Border Guard Police – was the Myanmar military junta's last stand in northern Rakhine State, which lies along the border with Bangladesh. Video by the insurgent Arakan Army (AA) which was besieging the base shows their rag-tag fighters, many barefoot, firing an assortment of weapons into the base, while air force jets roar over their heads. It was a ferocious battle - perhaps the bloodiest of the civil war which has consumed Myanmar since the military seized power in a coup in 2021. \"They had dug deep ditches filled with spikes around the base,\" an AA source told the BBC. \"There were bunkers and reinforced buildings. They laid more than a thousand mines. Many of our fighters lost limbs, or their lives, trying to get through.\" For the coup leader, General Min Aung Hlaing, this has been yet another humiliating defeat after a year of military setbacks. For the first time his regime has lost control of an entire border: the 270km (170 miles) dividing Myanmar from Bangladesh now wholly under AA control. And with only the Rakhine State capital Sittwe still firmly in military hands, though cut off from the rest of the country, the AA is likely to be the first insurgent group to take complete control of a state.\n\nThe army has been in headlong retreat from the Arakan Army since the beginning of the year, losing town after town. The last army units withdrew in September to BGP5, a compound covering around 20 hectares just outside the border town of Maungdaw, where the AA laid siege. BGP5 was built on the site of a Muslim Rohingya village, Myo Thu Gyi, which was burned down during the violent expulsion of much of the Rohingya population by the armed forces in 2017. It was the first of many burned villages I saw on a visit to Maungdaw right after the military operation in September of that year, a mass of charred debris in among the lush tropical vegetation, its inhabitants killed or forced to flee to Bangladesh. When I returned two years later, the new police complex had already been built, with all the trees removed, giving defenders a clear view of any attacking force. The AA source told us their advance towards it was painfully slow, requiring the insurgents to dig their own ditches for cover. It does not publish its own casualties. But judging from the intensity of fighting in Maungdaw, which began in June, it is likely to have lost hundreds of its own troops.\n\nThroughout the siege, the Myanmar air force kept up a constant bombardment of Maungdaw, driving the last civilians out of the town. Its planes dropped supplies to the besieged soldiers at night, but it was never enough. They had plenty of rice stored in the bunkers, a local source told us, but they could not get any treatment for their injuries, and the soldiers became demoralised. They started to surrender last weekend. AA video shows them coming out in a pitiful state, waving white cloths. Some are hobbling on makeshift crutches, or hopping, their injured legs wrapped in rags. Few are wearing shoes. Inside the wrecked buildings the victorious insurgents filmed piles of bodies. The AA says more than 450 soldiers died in the siege. It has published images of the captured commander, Brigadier-General Thurein Tun, and his officers kneeling beneath the flagpole, now flying the insurgents' banner.\n\nBrigadier-General Thurein Tun (centre) appeared as a prisoner in the Arakan Army footage\n\nPro-military commentators in Myanmar have been venting their frustration on social media. \"Min Aung Hlaing, you have not asked any of your children to serve in the military,\" wrote one. \"Is this how you use us? Are you happy seeing all those deaths in Rakhine?\" \"At this rate, all that will be left of the Tatmadaw [military] will be Min Aung Hlaing and a flagpole,\" wrote another. The capture of BGP5 also shows the Arakan Army to be one of the most effective fighting forces in Myanmar. Formed only in 2009 – much later than most of Myanmar's other insurgent groups – by young ethnic Rakhine men who had migrated to the Chinese border on the other side of the country in search of work, the AA is part of the Three Brotherhood Alliance which has inflicted most of the defeats suffered by the junta since last year. The other two members of the alliance have stayed on the border, in Shan State. But the AA moved back to Rakhine eight years ago to start its armed campaign for self-government, tapping into historic resentment among the Rakhine population of the poverty, isolation and central government neglect of their state. The AA leaders have proven to be smart, disciplined and able to motivate their fighters. They are already administering the large areas of Rakhine State they control as though they were running their own state. And they also have good weapons, thanks to their links with the older insurgent groups on the Chinese border, and appear to be well-funded. There is a bigger question, though, over how much the various ethnic insurgent groups are willing to prioritise the goal of overthrowing the military junta. Publicly they say they do, alongside the shadow government which was deposed by the coup, and the hundreds of volunteer peoples' defence forces which have sprung up to support it. In return for the support it is getting from the ethnic insurgents, the shadow government is promising a new federal political system which will give Myanmar's regions self-rule. But already the other two members of the Three Brotherhood Alliance have accepted China's request for a ceasefire. China is seeking a negotiated end to the civil war which would almost certainly leave the military with much of its power intact.\n\nThe Rohingya village of Myo Thu Gyi, burned by the military in 2017. There are fears for the remaining Rohingya population under an Arakan Army administration.\n\nThe opposition insists the military must be reformed and removed from politics. But having already made so many territorial gains at the expense of the junta, the ethnic insurgents may be tempted to strike a deal with China's blessing rather than keep fighting to oust the generals. The group's leadership is tight-lipped about its plans. But it takes over a state that was always poor and which has suffered greatly from the intense fighting of the past year. \"Eighty per cent of the housing in Maungdaw and the surrounding villages has been destroyed,\" one Rohingya man who left Maungdaw recently for Bangladesh told the BBC. \"The town is deserted. Almost all the shops and houses have been looted.\" Last month the United Nations, whose agencies are being given very little access to Rakhine, warned of looming famine, because of the huge numbers of displaced people and the difficulty of getting any supplies in, past a military blockade. The AA is trying to set up its own administration, but the BBC has been told by some of those displaced by the fighting that the group cannot feed or shelter them. It is also unclear how the AA will treat the Rohingya population, still thought to number around 600,000 in Rakhine, even after the expulsion of 700,000 in 2017. The largest number live in northern Rakhine State and Maungdaw has long been a predominantly Rohingya town. Relations with the ethnic Rakhine majority, the support base for the AA, have long been fraught. They are now a great deal worse after Rohingya militant groups, which have their power base in the vast refugee camps in Bangladesh, chose to take sides with the military, against the AA, despite the army's track record of persecuting Rohingyas. Many Rohingyas do not like these groups, and some say they are happy to live in an AA-run Rakhine State. But tens of thousands have been expelled by the AA from towns it has conquered, and not been allowed back. The AA has promised to include all communities in its vision for a future independent of the central government, but it has also denounced the Rohingyas it found itself fighting alongside the army. In August dozens of Rohingyas, many of them women and children trying to cross over to Bangladesh, were killed by bombs, almost certainly dropped from AA drones. \"We cannot deny the fact that Rohingyas have been persecuted by Myanmar governments for many years, and the Rakhine people supported that,\" said the Rohingya man we spoke to in Bangladesh. \"The government wants to keep Rohingyas from becoming citizens, but the Rakhine people believe there should be no Rohingyas at all in Rakhine State.

Mohammed al-Bukhaiti told the BBC that the Houthis would \"escalate our military targeting of Israel\" until it stopped what he described as \"the genocide in Gaza\". On Thursday, Israeli warplanes struck the international airport in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, and ports and power stations on the Red Sea coast, killing at least four people. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that its response to more than a year of missile and drone attacks by the Iran-backed group was \"just getting started\".\n\nOvernight, the Houthis launched another ballistic missile at Israel, which the Israeli military said was intercepted before it reached Israeli territory. The UN's secretary general said he was \"gravely concerned\" by the intensified escalation. He also called the strikes on the airport and ports were \"especially alarming\" and warned that they posed \"grave risks to humanitarian operations\" in the war-torn country. The Houthis, who control north-western Yemen, began attacking Israel and international shipping shortly after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza in October 2023. Israel has carried out four rounds of air strikes against the Houthis since July in retaliation for the 400 missiles and drones that the Israeli military says have been launched at the country from Yemen, most of which have been shot down. The US and UK have also carried out air strikes in Yemen in response to the group's attacks on dozens of merchant vessels in the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.\n\nHouthi supporters took part in a protest against Israel and the US in Sanaa on Friday\n\nMohammed al-Bukhaiti, a member of the Houthis' political bureau, told the BBC's Newshour programme on Friday that Yemenis were now \"moving to a direct confrontation\" with the US, UK and Israel after fighting what he called their \"tools\" during Yemen's decade-long civil war. He appeared to be referring to the Saudi-led coalition that intervened in support of the Yemeni government when the Houthis seized control of Sanaa in 2015. \"We are committed to continuing our military operation in support of Gaza and we will not stop until the genocide crimes and the siege on Gaza stop. We are going to escalate our military targe", "continuation": "ting of Israel,\" he said. Israel has vehemently denied that its forces are committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Bukhaiti said the Houthis did not need the support of Iran, which has seen its allies Hamas and Hezbollah devastated by wars with Israel over the past 14 months. \"We have enough capabilities - militarily, economically, and even in popular support - to go through this battle, even if we are on our own,\" he insisted. He also said the Houthis expected an escalation by the US after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next month, but he warned that it would \"backfire\". Israel's prime minister said on Thursday evening that his country had \"attacked targets of the Houthi terrorist organisation\" as part of what he called a \"war of redemption\". \"We are determined to cut off this terrorist arm of Iran's axis of evil. We will persist until we get the job done,\" Benjamin Netanyahu said. Defence Minister Israel Katz meanwhile warned that Israel would \"hunt down all the Houthi leaders\", as it had done with the leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah. UN spokeswoman Stéphanie Tremblay said Secretary General António Guterres remained \"deeply concerned about the risk of further escalation in the region and reiterates his call for all parties concerned to cease all military actions and exercise utmost restraint\".\n\nThe Israeli military said its air strikes targeted Houthi \"military infrastructure\" at Sanaa International Airport and the Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations, as well as infrastructure at the Red Sea ports of Hudaydah, Salif and Ras Kanatib used to smuggle in Iranian weapons. The Houthis' military spokesman said only civilian facilities were hit and that the strikes resulted in fatalities and material damage. The Houthi-controlled Saba news agency reported that three people were killed at Sanaa airport and that another three were killed in Hudaydah province. However, the deputy transport minister of the government in Houthi-controlled Yemen, Yahya al-Sayani, put the death toll as four during a news conference on Friday. He said Sanaa airport's control tower, departure lounge and navigational equipment were hit and damaged, and accused Israel of violating international law and aviation regulations. The strikes on the airport happened just as the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was about to board a UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) plane there. A crew member of the UN plane was seriously injured and was flown to Jordan on Friday after undergoing surgery at a local hospital, according to Dr Tedros. \"Deepest gratitude to the UNHAS team for their service and swift evacuation from Yemen,\" he wrote on X. \"Attacks on civilians and humanitarians must stop, everywhere.\" The WHO chief had been leading a high-level delegation to Yemen to assess the humanitarian situation in a country that has the world's highest levels of cholera and 80% of the population needs some form of aid. He had also been asked to try to negotiate the release of 16 UN personnel being detained by the Houthis. It is normal practice for the UN to share full details of humanitarian flights with all relevant parties. However, the Israeli military told the Associated Press that it had not been aware that the UN delegation was at the airport. WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris said its delegation was \"in contact with all relevant parties to ascertain the facts\" surrounding the incident."}

Watch: Gunmen shoot at cars and buildings on fire in Russia attacks\n\nAttacks on police posts, churches and a synagogue in Russia's North Caucasus republic of Dagestan have left 20 people dead, most of them police officers. Five gunmen were also killed. At least 46 people were taken to hospital with injuries after the Sunday evening attack. Three days of mourning have been declared in Dagestan, a predominantly Muslim republic in southern Russia which neighbours Chechnya. The apparently coordinated attacks targeted the cities of Derbent and Makhachkala on the Orthodox festival of Pentecost, with an Orthodox priest among those killed. He was later identified as Father Nikolai Kotelnikov, who had served in Derbent for more than 40 years. Russian media reported that around 18:00 (15:00 GMT) local time on Sunday, gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons on an Orthodox church and a synagogue in Derbent, which is home to an ancient Jewish community. Two gunmen were said to have then retreated into a nearby building, where police later said they were killed. The Kele-Numaz synagogue was severely damaged by fire. At around the same time, in the city of Makhachkala, two gunmen ran into an Orthodox church, tried to set fire to its main icon and then opened fire, Izvestia newspaper said. Videos on social media showed heavy shooting also taking place outside the church when gunmen dressed in black took aim at passing police cars with automatic weapons. A police post near the Makhachkala synagogue was also attacked. All exits from the city were closed for some time as the interior ministry stated that it was possible the militants' accomplices were preparing to escape the city. In the nearby village of Sergokala, a police officer was injured a few hours later when a police car was attacked. Later, the head of the republic of Dagestan, Sergei Melikov, said at least 15 police officers were killed in total. Dagestan has in the past been the scene of Islamist attacks. Although the assailants have not been officially identified, Russian media widely reported that among the gunmen were two sons of the head of the Sergokala district, Magomed Omarov, who was detained by police. However, in a video posted on Telegram, Mr Melikov implied Ukraine had been involved in the attack and that Dagestan was now directly involved in Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\n\"The war is coming to our homes,\" Mr Melikov said. \"We understand who is behind the organisation of the terrorist attacks and what goal they pursued,\" he said. On Monday, Mr Melikov said authorities were continuing to hunt for members of \"sleeper cells\" who had prepared the attacks, including with assistance from abroad. The head of the Russian State Duma's international affairs committee, Leonid Slutsky, put forward similar claims, saying that the Dagestan attacks and a missile strike which killed four in Russia-occupied Sevastopol on Sunday \"could not be a coincidence\". \"These tragic events, I am sure, were orchestrated from abroad and are aimed at sowing panic and dividing the Russian people,\" Mr Slutsky said. But a leading Russian nationalist in occupied Ukraine, Dmitry Rogozin, warned that if every attack was blamed on \"the machinations of Ukraine and Nato, this pink mist will lead us to big problems\". An attack on the Crocus City Hall venue near Moscow in March which left 147 dead was blamed by Russian authorities on Ukraine and the West, even though the Islamic State group claimed it. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia's President Vladimir Putin offered his condolences to those who lost loved ones in the attacks on Crimea and Dagestan. Russian news agencies reported on Monday morning that the counter-terrorism operation launched after the attacks had now come to an end. Between 2007 and 2017, a jihadist organisation called the Caucasus Emirate, and later the Islamic Emirate of the Caucasus, staged attacks in Dagestan and the neighbouring Russian republics of Chechnya, Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria. Following the Crocus City Hall attack in Moscow, President Vladimir Putin had insisted that \"Russia cannot be the target of terrorist attacks by Islamic fundamentalists” because it “demonstrates a unique example of interfaith harmony and inter-religious and inter-ethnic unity”.

The child, known as \"Child X\", was handcuffed and confronted by marksmen in Hackney, east London, in July last year.

{"context": "Weighing only 3kg (6.6lb), Abdulaziz has just been released from intensive care after treatment for severe malnutrition\n\nFive-month-old Abdulaziz al-Hourani lies in his bed at al-Ahli hospital in northern Gaza, his small body showing signs of undernourishment. Weighing only 3kg (6.6lb), Abdulaziz has just been released from the intensive care unit, where he was treated for severe malnutrition. His mother says she can’t get the food he needs in Gaza. “This is my only baby. He is supposed to weigh at least 5kg (11lb) and I am very worried about his health,” she says. “I can’t take him abroad because the borders are closed.” Abdulaziz’s story is not unique. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 8,000 children under the age of five have been diagnosed and treated for acute malnutrition since the war began - of those 1,600 were severe cases. Last week, WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there had “already been 32 deaths attributed to malnutrition, including 28 among children under five\". At the beginning of June, the UN’s children’s agency, Unicef, reported that nine out of 10 children in Gaza were experiencing severe food poverty, surviving on two or fewer food groups per day. It said that “months of hostilities and restrictions on humanitarian aid have collapsed the food and health systems, resulting in catastrophic consequenc", "continuation": "es” and that children were “at risk of life-threatening malnutrition\".\n\nAbdulaziz's mother says she can’t get the food he needs in Gaza\n\nI was born in Gaza and lived there with my family - I reported from there until February. Before the war, I knew northern Gaza’s al-Tufah district as a bustling place with thousands of shoppers. But when I call people still there to ask about conditions, they send me pictures showing it is now nearly deserted. “There are no tomatoes, no cucumbers, no fruit, and no bread,” says Salim Shabaka, an elderly man at the market. He tells me only some used clothes and a limited supply of canned foods are on display. “We have never known life like this - nothing to buy or sell,” adds another street vendor. “I have seven children and have not received any aid.” Every day, long queues form in front of “Tikkeyas” - small food stalls providing free meals. Many have been funded by better-off individuals in northern Gaza, but the shortage of supplies means their future is uncertain. For now, this is where some children go to try to get a hot meal, while others walk long distances to fetch water.\n\nOnce a bustling place with thousands of shoppers, northern Gaza’s al-Tufah district is now nearly deserted\n\nAlmost every day, I speak to relatives and friends in Gaza. In the pictures they send me I can see they have lost weight and I notice the change in their faces. And Dr Tedros at the WHO has warned that \"despite reports of increased delivery of food, there is currently no evidence that those who need it most are receiving sufficient quantity and quality of food\". He added that, due to insecurity and lack of access, only two stabilisation centres for severely malnourished patients could currently operate. He warned that the lack of health services, clean water and sanitation “significantly increases the risk of malnourished children\". The situation means the spread of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis, is also more likely. Most hospitals and clinics are closed, and those still operating are damaged and overcrowded. “We are drained and out of energy,” says Umm Fouad Jaber, an elderly woman from Jabalia, in northern Gaza. “We have been displaced several times, and people are being killed every day.\" “We have eaten animal food, and children and women pass out because of malnutrition. Diseases have eaten our bodies.” Palestinian doctor Moatasem Saed Salah, a member of the emergency committee at the Hamas-run health ministry, confirms that dozens of cases of malnutrition are reported every day, especially among children and pregnant and breastfeeding women. He says many people, already suffering from chronic diseases, are now struggling with other health conditions too.\n\nThe war began after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 37,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, and many hundreds of thousands more have been injured or displaced. Gazans have looked to humanitarian aid to survive, but not enough supplies are getting through.\n\nAt one point, the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border in the south of Gaza was the main point of entry for aid. But with Israel now controlling the Gaza side of the crossing, it is closed. Also in the south is the Kerem Shalom gateway from Israel. It is open, but fighting has restricted the flow of aid along this route. Some food is also being shipped to the north through new crossing points, but the volume of aid has dropped by two-thirds since 7 May, according to UN figures, and supplies are dwindling in the south, according to the World Food Programme. A US-built floating pier for aid shipments was out of operation for days after being damaged by bad weather, and has since been temporarily moved due to high seas. Twenty international aid agencies warned that the \"unpredictable trickle of aid into Gaza has created a mirage of improved access while the humanitarian response is on the verge of collapse\". Last week, Gaza’s Hamas-run government reported that no more than 35 lorries were arriving in Gaza each day, and said these are the only source of food and medicine for 700,000 people in north Gaza. But in a post on X on 13 June, the Israeli body responsible for humanitarian co-ordination, Cogat, said: “Over one billion pounds of food were transferred to Gaza since the start of the war. “There is no limit to the [a]mount of humanitarian aid, including all kinds of medicines that can enter Gaza.” In another post on the same day Cogat said 220 aid lorries had entered Gaza that day. It blames aid agencies for logistical failures in distributing food and other supplies, and says more than 1,300 aid lorries are still waiting to be collected. The UN says distribution of what does get through is severely hampered by fighting, the breakdown of law and order, and other Israeli restrictions. On Sunday, the Israeli military announced daily \"tactical pauses of military activity\" along a road in southern Gaza to allow more humanitarian aid to enter. But it emphasised that there was no ceasefire and that combat would continue in Rafah. Israel says its operation in Rafah is necessary to oust Hamas from what it calls the group's “last major stronghold”. These pauses, which were said to have begun on Saturday, will be from 08:00 to 19:00 local time (05:00 to 16:00 GMT) and will only affect a route leading northwards from the Kerem Shalom crossing. A UN spokesperson welcomed the announcement but on Sunday noted it hadn't yet increased aid on the ground. UN agencies earlier warned that if hostilities continued, more than one million Palestinians in Gaza could face severe starvation by mid-July."}

The aircraft, which was flying from Spain to the Austrian capital Vienna, was forced to issue a mayday call and land after hail smashed the cockpit widows and tore off the front nose cone. Passengers said the flight rocked heavily throughout the ordeal, with one telling Austrian media that chunks of the destroyed nose cone could be seen flying past the plane. In a statement to the BBC, Austrian Airlines said the incident occurred after the aircraft flew into a thunderstorm \"which was not visible on the weather radar\", adding that no passengers were injured in the saga.\n\nImages shared online showed heavy damage to the exterior of the Airbus A320 aircraft, with the front nose cone almost entirely blown away. Other photos appeared showed dense white cracks across the front windscreen. Emmeley Oakley, a passenger on the flight, told ABC News that the plane was on its final approach into Vienna when it was suddenly rocked by the storm. \"I think we were about 20 minutes from landing when we got into a cloud of hail and thunderstorm, and the turbulence started,\" she told the broadcaster.

Alonso’s best time, which put him 0.463 seconds ahead of Mercedes’ George Russell in second, came at the driest point of the second session before more rain fell in Montreal. The first session, in which McLaren’s Lando Norris was fastest, was also rain-affected, so the headline lap times of the day were almost entirely meaningless. But there were obvious problems for championship leader Max Verstappen. The Red Bull driver, who was 18th fastest in the second session, pitted after just four laps with smoke pouring from the back of his car. Red Bull said his car had suffered a problem with the energy recovery system. Verstappen said: “It’s not ideal, I would have liked to drive more laps. So it’s definitely not how I would have liked to get on in P2. “But it is more important to figure out what happened and what implications it will have on the weekend and the rest of the year.” Wet weather was the theme of the day. At one stage, before practice started, organisers closed the Ile-Notre Dame, the man-made island in the St Lawrence Seaway that hosts the track, because of a heavy storm. The first session started on time but the cars were unable to go out as the pit lane was not opened while marshals tried to dry the track.\n\nWhen it did get under way, it progressively dried to the point that the drivers were able to run slick tyres for the final five minutes of the session. Norris set the pace by 0.328secs from the Ferraris of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc. In the second session, Alonso ran consistently at the front as the track had a brief dry period for 15 minutes or so at the start before rain started again. The two-time champion said: “A tricky Friday for everyone. Not many laps in either session. “No proper laps in dry conditions or in wet conditions, but it could be like this in qualifying and race. We need to be sharp tomorrow.” Behind Alonso and Russell, the Spaniard’s team-mate Lance Stroll was third fastest, from Leclerc, RB’s Daniel Ricciardo, Haas driver Kevin Magnussen and Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes. Hamilton, who with Michael Schumacher is the equal most successful driver in Montreal with seven wins, said: “It felt great. I was just raring to go every second. This is a track where it’s building blocks, about getting as much time in the car and understanding both conditions and the changes they have made to the surface and the run-off areas. “The car was feeling strong. I thoroughly enjoyed it. “The circuit is amazing. It is one of the best circuits but this was an odd day, like a summer’s day in the UK. It was summer this morning then it rains with huge hailstones, then sunny and hot and humid and then rain again. \"I feel really confident out there but we won’t know until we get out there on Saturday but on either conditions I felt really strong today.” Despite the conditions, only one driver crashed all day - Sauber’s Zhou Gunayu lost control through Turn Five in the first session and broke his front suspension. Leclerc won a cheer from the crowd at the hairpin when he did a 360-degree spin in the second session, to no harm.\n\nThe first practice session started in very wet conditions but the circuit quickly dried out"}

The works - part of a collection at the Kunsthaus Zurich museum - are by some of the world's most acclaimed artists, including Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh. There have long been suspicions about the provenance of works in the Emil Bührle Collection - named after a German-born arms dealer who made his fortune during World War T", "continuation": "wo by making and selling weapons to the Nazis. The decision to remove the paintings comes following the publication of new guidelines aimed at dealing with the large number of cultural works that have still not been returned to the families they were stolen from.\n\nThe artworks that are under investigation are: Jardin de Monet à Giverny by Claude Monet, Portrait of the Sculptor Louis-Joseph by Gustave Courbet, Georges-Henri Manuel by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, The Old Tower by Vincent van Gogh, and La route montante by Paul Gauguin. The foundation board for the Emil Buhrle Collection said in a statement it was \"committed to seeking a fair and equitable solution for these works with the legal successors of the former owners, following best practices\". A sixth work in the collection, La Sultane by Edouard Manet, has also come under further scrutiny but the foundation said it did not believe the new guidelines applied to it and that the painting would be considered separately. \"Due to the overall historical circumstances relating to the sale, the Foundation is prepared to offer a financial contribution to the estate of Max Silberberg in respect to the tragic destiny of the former owner,\" it said. Silberberg was a German Jewish industrialist whose extensive art collection was sold at forced auctions by the Nazis. It is thought he was murdered at the Auschwitz Nazi death camp during the Holocaust. According to the Neue Zürcher Zeitung newspaper, there has been debate about whether Silberberg was forced to sell La Sultane or whether he freely did so for financial reasons.\n\nMore than 20 countries, including Switzerland, agreed earlier this year to new best practices from the US State Department, external about how to deal with Nazi-looted art. They were issued to mark the 25th anniversary of the 1998 Washington Conference Principles, which laid out a set of principles aimed at making restitution for items that were either stolen or forcibly sold. The principles are an important recourse for families seeking to recover looted art as, under Swiss law, no legal claims for restitution or compensation can be made today for works from the Bührle collection due to statutes of limitations. Stuart Eizenstat, the US secretary of state's special advisor on Holocaust issues, said during the announcement of the best practices in March that it was estimated \"over 100,000 of the 600,000 paintings and many more of the millions of books, manuscripts, ritual religious items, and other cultural objects stolen have never been returned\". Up to his death in 1956, Bührle amassed a collection of about 600 artworks. A large number of these are managed by the Bührle Foundation and have been on display at the Kunsthaus as part of a 20-year loan. The rest are said to hang in the homes of Bührle's surviving relatives."}

It's an argument which goes b", "continuation": "eyond the hundreds of millions it will cost to rebuild. There have also been concerns over publicly funding a facility which bears the name of an Irish rebel, executed for high treason. But who was Roger Casement? His story is told in a new BBC Sounds podcast series, The Mystery Of: Casement, Rebel Knight.\n\nCasement Park's redevelopment will no longer be done to UEFA specifications, reducing its cost dramatically\n\nRoger was a Dublin boy, the son of a British Army officer. The family moved to County Antrim when he was a teenager, where he attended the school which is now Ballymena Academy. He left at 15 to begin work in the office of a shipping line in Liverpool. That job led him to work on one of the company's ships transporting goods to and from the Congo River in West Africa. A job with the International African Association established by the Belgian King, Leopold II would follow. Patrick Casement, the great grandson of Roger's second cousin, still lives in the family home and has kept records of letters written by Roger during his time in Africa. \"He was driven in a way, and you get that sense from his incessant letter writing,\" said Patrick.\n\nRoger writes of his inability to ignore the terrible treatment of the locals, who were exploited by the Europeans. \"He had seen evidence of maltreatment and atrocities before we went up into the rubber plantations, but I think what he saw there shifted his whole view of the colonial experience,\" Patrick said. \"It was a turning point in his life.\" Roger later worked for the British Consular Service and in 1903 produced a damning report into atrocities he witness in the Congo. His exposing of human rights abuses earned him not only international renown and a knighthood, but also a bitter resentment of colonial powers which would eventually lead him to the gallows. Dr Reuben Loffman, from Queen Mary University of London, says Roger deserves to be remembered for \"taking African voices seriously\".\n\nDespite being knighted in 1911, Roger had a pivotal role in founding the Irish Volunteers, and publicly canvased for donations as part of the groups bid to end British rule in Ireland. In an attempt to capitalise on Britain's feud with Germany during World War I, he was a principal organiser in the purchase of weapons which were to be shipped from Hamburg. Roger, along with fellow rebels Robert Monteith and Daniel Julian Bailey, was ferried back to the coastal waters off Ireland aboard a German u-boat. They made their way ashore in a small rowing boat with rifles to be supplied to the armed rebellion known as the Easter Rising. The rising was ultimately a military failure and Roger's involvement led to his conviction for high treason. Some of the weapons were retrieved from the seabed and presented as evidence at his trial. On 3 August 1916 Roger was hanged in London.\n\nSupporters of the Northern Ireland football team held banners against Casement Park's redevelopment\n\nSome unionist politicians in Northern Ireland have called for any rebuilt stadium on the site of Casement Park to be given a different name, and point to several other GAA grounds which have been named after Irish republicans. The political changes Roger pursued in the early 20th century are still contested today. He is remembered by some as a revolutionary and human rights activist responsible for exposing atrocities in Africa. To others, he is a symbol of unwanted rebellion."}

The move is part of the manifesto pledge to put the Armed Forces Covenant - a promise to treat those who have served with fairness and respect - fully into law.\n\nPolly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, welcomed the changes but said to give veterans proper housing the government would need to build 90,000 social rent homes a year for 10 years. \"It is absolutely right that veterans and everyone facing homelessness are given priority access to a secure, genuinely affordable home,\" Ms Neate said. \"Tinkering with the rules for who qualifies for homes where won't address the fact that there's just fundamentally not enough social housing available. \"Decades of failure to build enough homes for social rent has left us with a huge shortage, and condemned more than 1.3 million households to years on waiting lists.\""}
{"context": "Erik ten Hag won the FA Cup last month, his second major trophy in two seasons at Manchester United\n\nErik ten Hag will remain as manager of Manchester United following a post-season review by the club's board. It is understood they are now talking to Ten Hag about extending his contract, which is about to enter its final season. United instigated their review immediately after the FA Cup final. Ten Hag went into the game against Manchester City at Wembley amid a backdrop of reports claiming he would be sacked no matter the outcome. Instead, United's deserved 2-1 victory allowed the club hierarchy to approach the review in a more positive light. It is understood what are being described as \"constructive conversations\" with Ten Hag have taken place around the outcome of the review. All eventualities were considered and the clear preference was for the 54-year-old Dutchman to remain in charge. Ten Hag is known to be delighted at the outcome, though there were suggestions he was getting irritated at the time taken for United to reach it. United do not believe two weeks is an unreasonable length of time to conduct a thorough assessment of what is the first season under a change of ownership. Former Bayern Munich boss Thomas Tuchel is thought to have spoken to new United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe last week but ruled himself out of the running, while the club's interest in Mauricio Pochettino cooled even though he was available after his exit from Chelsea. Former Brighton and Chelsea boss Graham Potter, Brentford manager Thomas Frank, Ex-Brighton boss Roberto de Zerbi and England manager Gareth Southgate have also been linked with the job. Brentford were never contacted about Frank, and appointing Southgate this summer was impossible because of his commitments with England. Ten Hag has been on holiday with his family in Ibiza.\n\nUnited finished eighth last season - their lowest position in the Premier League era. They suffered the most injuries, with 45 separate cases recorded, a fact Ten Hag often cited for some below-par displays. The Dutchman took charge at Old Trafford in the summer of 2022 and is United's fifth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013, following David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He arrived at Old Trafford following a successful four-and-a-half-year spell at Ajax during which he won three Eredivisie titles and two Dutch Cups. In his debut season he led the club to third place in the Premier League, along with the EFL Cup and FA Cup finals. He won his first trophy as United boss in February 2023 when the Red Devils beat Newcastle to lift the EFL Cup, but they were beaten by Manchester City in the FA Cup final three months later. The 2023-24 season proved more difficult, including an early exit from the Champions League after finishing bottom of their group. United started poorly with six defeats in their opening 10 games, including to Galatasaray and Bayern Munich in the Champions League. They also finished weakly; despite the FA Cup final triumph, they only won five of their final 12 matches in all competitions.\n\nRatcliffe's Ineos group bought a 27.7% stake in the club in December and new director Sir David Brailsford has since been conducting a review of football operations at Old Trafford. Ratcliffe had hinted at retaining Ten Hag in January when he said the \"environment\" at the club was not set up for managers to succeed. \"In the last 11 years, Manchester United have had a lot of coaches and nobody has been very successful in that environment. That says to me there is something wrong with the environment,\" said Ratcliffe. Confirmation Ten Hag is staying means United can now finally look to build after a difficult campaign, and explore the transfer market. Ten Hag was backed last summer with the signings of goalkeeper Andre Onana, midfielder Mason Mount and forward Rasmus Hojlund. During his period in charge, Ten Hag has also had to deal with numerous off-field issues. Forward Mason Greenwood joined Getafe on loan after an internal investigation decided his future was best served away from Old Trafford, while winger Antony was given leave after allegations in Brazil against him from a former girlfriend, which he denies. Less than a month into the season, winger Jadon Sancho was dropped from the squad after refusing to apologise to Ten Hag for claiming he had been made a \"scapegoat\" by the Dutchman.\n\nIn their first few weeks of co-ownership, Ineos came to the conclusion a proper assessment of Ten Ha's work was impossible because the club did not have the right structures in place that would allow any manager to succeed. At that point, it seemed certain Ten Hag would remain. But United's calamitous form in April, which almost included throwing away a three-goal lead in the FA Cup semi-final against Championship side Coventry, almost made it impossible for the Dutchman to continue. Had what would have been a last-gasp winner for Coventry not been ruled out by a marginal video assistant referee decision, it is hard to imagine Ten Hag would still be in a job now. As it was, United went through on penalties, then beat Manchester City with by far their best performance of the season, securing European qualification on the way. Ten Hag has become one of only four United managers to win trophies in successive seasons - a point not lost on the club’s hierarchy. The club have admiration for the dedication, dignity and professionalism with which Ten Hag has conducted himself through a trying season. They also recognise the pivotal role he has played in the development of youngsters Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, who will be on international duty at the Copa America and Euro 2024 for Argentina and England respectively this summer. Evidently, he has also had to contend with a massive injury list a", "continuation": "nd ease new signings Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund into the fold. It is felt Ten Hag should prosper in a different sporting structure, that will eventually see Dan Ashworth installed as sporting director, Jason Wilcox as football director and Omar Berrada as chief executive."}
{"context": "With 36 games played and eight teams eliminated, we're now into knockout football at the European Championship in Germany. Sixteen teams remain in the mix for a place in the final of Euro 2024 in Berlin on 14 July. BBC Sport takes a look at a few of the things to watch out for in the knockout stage.\n\nOptimism is growing among Germany fans that their side can go all the way\n\nThere is nothing quite like winning a major trophy on home soil, and there is a growing belief in Germany that they might just do it. As fan zones filled up to watch their opening game against Scotland there was optimism - but still a feeling that Germany were building a team. After a thumping 5-1 victory, Germany fans truly believe. Speak to them in bars, train stations and cafes across the country and there are not many doubts. With a squad packed full of talent, a buoyant following in the stands, and a young, creative manager in Julian Nagelsmann, it is a real opportunity for Germany to make it all the way to Berlin. First up, though, are Denmark in the last 16.\n\nFrance and Portugal have met in recent years in the Nations League and Euro 2020 and could face off again in Germany\n\nIt is going to come, right? Cristiano Ronaldo was the joint top scorer at Euro 2020 and all eyes were on him as the spearhead of this Portugal team in Germany. But the 39-year-old didn't manage a goal in the group stage - the first time that has happened at either a Euros or World Cup. It isn't for the want of trying, however. He has had 12 shots so far at Euro 2024 - more than any other player. Should both sides navigate their last-16 games, Portugal and France will meet in the quarter-finals and you would imagine Ronaldo would go all out to upsta", "continuation": "ge Kylian Mbappe.\n\nBelgium’s ‘golden generation’ may have been and gone but, ranked third in the world, there are still high expectations on them to perform at this tournament. So far, they have failed to deliver. A goalless draw with Ukraine was enough to send fans over the edge as they jeered and voiced their frustrations despite Belgium progressing to the knockout stage. Kevin de Bruyne sent out a rallying call in his media conference on Wednesday, claiming Belgium “need the fans”. Will they back them? Or have Belgium got work to do to win them round? Their match against France is on Monday.\n\nLamine Yamal, right, has been one the young stars at Euro 2024\n\nStars of the tournament so far, the Spaniards have returned to the heights of European football and have new kids on the block. Nico Williams, Lamine Yamal and co have lit up the tournament with their fearlessness and creativity. From nutmegs to backheel flicks and no-look passes, Spain’s talented youngsters have shown they have the ingredients to take this country all the way. At 16 years old, Barcelona's Yamal has already struck fear into defenders and there is no suggestion he intends on slowing down any time soon. Spanish fans are now sporting Williams’ name on the backs of their shirts, and Pedri controls the midfield like a veteran. The kids are all right. Next up? Georgia on Sunday.\n\nDutch fans have been marching to games in Germany as part of a bright orange parade\n\nIt is the fans who make a tournament and every country's supporters have played their part in bringing joy and atmosphere to games at Euro 2024. However, it has to be said the Netherlands contingent have been a particularly memorable presence in Germany so far. In Hamburg, Leipzig and Berlin they turned the streets bright orange, walking, dancing and singing their way to the stadiums behind a double-decker bus blasting our trance tunes. Next, Munich residents can look forward to witnessing it as that is where the Dutch will play Romania in their last-16 tie on 2 July. Oh, and curious about the song they sing when bouncing left to right during their march? Search 'Links Rechts'. You're welcome.\n\nAustria are proving to be the ones to watch at Euro 2024, having topped a difficult group that included the Netherlands and France. A lot of the credit for that goes to their boss - former Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick. Known as The Godfather of Gegenpressing, Rangnick has fashioned a side that is full of energy, running and desire. Their love of the press means they have been capable of doing some damage early in games. In March, Christoph Baumgartner scored the fastest goal in international football with a strike inside seven seconds against Slovakia, and in Germany they have been quick off the mark too. They have scored in the opening 10 minutes in two of their three games so far, so Turkey will need to be alert from the outset in their last-16 match. Will Rangnick, who was derided at United, come back to haunt English football in the semi-finals?"}

{"context": "'We just need peace': BBC speaks to Syrians watching Israel's incursion\n\nJawdat al-Tawil said his community could only wait and watch for Israel's next move\n\nAn hour's drive from Damascus, on a country road into the Syrian village of Hadar, we meet Israel's army. Two military vehicles and several soldiers in full combat gear man an impromptu checkpoint – a foreign authority in a country celebrating its freedom. They waved us through. It was evidence of Israel's incursion into Syrian territory – the temporary seizure, it said, of a UN-monitored buffer zone, set up in a ceasefire agreement 50 years ago. \"Maybe they'll leave, maybe they'll stay, maybe they'll make the area safe then go away,\" said Riyad Zaidan, who lives in Hadar. \"We want to hope, but we'll have to wait and see.\" The village chief, Jawdat al-Tawil, pointed to the Golan Heights territory Israel occupied in 1967, clearly visible from Hadar's terraces. Many residents here have relatives still living there. Now, they see Israeli forces routinely moving around their own village, parts of which jut into the demilitarized zone. On a slope above, Israeli bulldozers can be seen working on the hillside. A week after President Assad's regime fell, the sense of freedom here comes tinged with fatalism. Jawdat al-Tawil told me proudly how the village had defended itself against militia groups during the Syrian civil war, and showed me portraits of the dozens of men who had died doing so. \"We don't allow anyone to transgress on our land,\" he said. \"[But] Israel is a state – we can't stand against it. We used to stand up to individuals, but Israel is a super-power.\"\n\nThe IDF has released footage of troops operating in Syria\n\nSince the fall of Syria's former president Bashar al-Assad earlier this month, Israel has also carried out hundreds of airstrikes on military targets across Syria. And Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced new plans to double the population of Israeli settlements in the occupied Golan Heights, saying the move was needed because of \"the new front\" that had opened up in Syria. Speaking before that plan was unveiled, Syria's interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa warned Israel's military manoeuvres risked unwarranted escalation in the region and said his administration did not want conflict with Israel. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said its actions were necessary because of threats posed by jihadist groups operating along the ceasefire line with Syria, describing its military incursions there as \"limited and temporary\". The residents of Hadar belong mainly to the Druze community – a tight-knit, introverted group which splintered from mainstream Shia Islam centuries ago. When Israel occupied part of the Golan Heights in the 1967 war, and later unilaterally annexed it, some of the Druze there opted to remain and take Israeli citizenship.\n\nAl-Sharaa, the leader of the Syrian militia Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) that forced President Assad from power this month, has his family roots in the occupied Golan Heights. Some here on the Syrian-controlled side fear Israel's plan is to grab more territory for itself. For years, Israel has been battling the Iran-backed militia there that supported Assad. This border region is a key weapons-supply route between Tehran and the proxy forces it maintains, including the Lebanese militia Hezbollah. Assad's fall has left those groups – and Iran – weaker. But Israel has since stepped up its military campaign, taking advantage of the political vacuum to extend its reach. It has also been targeting military equipment left by Assad's forces at bases across the country, worried about who might end up using it in the future. Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, said on Sunday that the \"immediate risks\" to Israel remained, and the recent developments in Syria had increased the threat, \"despite the moderate appearance that rebel leaders claim to present\". Marginalised by the Assad regime, and targeted as infidels by Sunni jihadist groups like HTS, Syria's Druze are more tolerant of Israel than many other communities here.\n\nTerritory controlled by Israel is visible from houses in Hadar\n\nThe village used to fight against the Iran-backed groups Israel sees as a threat here, but Jawdat al-Tawil told me that alliances in the area were shifting, and that he was now talking to these groups about reaching a deal. Syria is not a place where people have relied on only one ally, or fight only one enemy. \"We just need peace,\" resident Riyad Zaidan told me. \"We've had enough war, enough blood, enough hard life – we need to stop.\" Religious minorities like the Druze suffered under Assad. The country's new leaders from HTS have promised tolerance and respect for Syria's diverse ethnic and religious groups. But eight years ago the group was still aligned with global jihadist groups like al-Qaeda. It was around the time HTS split from al-Qaeda in 2016 that Jawdat al-Tawil's son, Abdo, was killed by their militiamen on the outskirts of Hadar, while fighting for the Syrian Ar", "continuation": "my.

{"context": "Migrants stranded for more than three years on the remote Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia have been brought to the UK. The Sri Lankan Tamils are permitted to remain in the country for six months, with financial support from the Foreign Office, according to documents seen by the BBC. Their journey to the UK marks the end of years of complex legal battles waged over thousands of miles over their fate, but their long-term future remains uncertain. Most of the group of around 60 migrants have been living in a makeshift camp on Diego Garcia - the site of a strategic UK-US military base - since October 2021, when they became the first people ever to file asylum claims there.\n\nOn Monday, a government spokesperson described the move as a \"one-off, due to the exceptional nature of these cases and in the interests of their welfare\". \"This government inherited a deeply troubling situation that remained unresolved under the last administration for years,\" the spokesperson said. Tessa Gregory of UK law firm Leigh Day, which represents some of the migrants, said it was the \"only sensible solution to end the humanitarian crisis\" on the island. \"This vulnerable group which includes 16 children have spent 38 months detained in the most squalid of conditions on Crown land... we hope our clients will now be able to seek safe haven and begin to rebuild their lives,\" she said. The BBC gained unprecedented access earlier this year to Diego Garcia and the migrant camp there, where the Tamils were housed in groups in military tents, some of which had leaks and rats nesting inside. During their time on the island, there were multiple hunger strikes and numerous incidents of self-harm and suicide attempts in response to the conditions, after which some people were transferred to Rwanda for medical treatment. There were also allegations of sexual assaults and harassment within the camp. Migrants have told the BBC it was like living in \"hell\".\n\nTamils have been housed in groups in military tents\n\nThose in Rwanda have also been brought to the UK, arriving on a flight on Tuesday morning. One told the BBC: \"I hope to turn a new page. I hope my health will improve and I will transform into a new person.\" Two men with criminal convictions and another under investigation remain on the island, the BBC understands. The Tamils’ arrival in the UK comes amid uncertainty over the future of the territory. The UK announced in October that it was ceding control of the Chagos Islands, of which Diego Garcia is part, to Mauritius. But the new Mauritian prime minister has said he has reservations over the deal, which was struck by his predecessor and has still to be signed, and has asked for an independent review. The deal is facing opposition from some politicians in the UK and allies of US President-elect Donald Trump. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has played down the criticism, describing it as a “good deal” for both Mauritius and the UK, and saying it addresses US concerns about the future of the Diego Garcia base. In recent years, the territory has been costing the UK tens of millions of pounds, with the bulk of this categorised under \"migrant costs\". Communications obtained by the BBC between Foreign Office officials in July warned that \"the costs are increasing and the latest forecast is that these will be £50m per annum\" if they were to remain there.\n\nDiego Garcia is part of the Chagos Islands\n\nIn letters sent to the Tamils on Friday from the Home Office, they were told they were being granted temporary entry clearance to the UK \"outside of the Immigration Rules\" to allow them to consider their \"long-term options\". It stressed that the offer did not \"constitute permanent settlement in the UK or recognition of refugee status by the UK government\", and said the group would not be permitted to work. The government says the Chagos Islands, known as the British Indian Ocean Territory (Biot), are \"constitutionally distinct\" from the UK, with the unusual status leading to the long legal dispute. Most of the Tamils have been awaiting final decisions on claims for international protection - which the United Nations says is akin to refugee status - or appealing against rejections. In total, eight have been granted international protection, meaning they cannot be returned to Sri Lanka, the BBC understands. Successive governments have previously said that bringing the Tamils to the UK would risk creating a \"backdoor migration route\". But the government said on Monday that arrangements had been made to ensure this did not happen, citing a deal to send future arrivals to St Helena - another UK territory some 5,000 miles away. \"Once a sovereignty agr", "continuation": "eement with Mauritius is fully in place they would then take responsibility for any future migrants,\" the spokesperson said."}

A 19-year-old Murray, himself once a promising youth footballer, joked in an interview that he would support \"whoever England were playing against\".\n\nIt went down like a lead balloon. He was abused in the comments of a blog he wrote on his website and even his wristbands, decorated with the Scottish saltire, attracted scrutiny.\n\nMurray had become a lightning rod, attracting ire in an edgy Anglo-Scottish atmosphere. The previous month, the then Scottish First Minister had been criticised for saying he would not be supporting England.\n\nBut the reaction to Murray's joke was on a far larger scale.\n\nIn the aftermath, Murray, playing only his second Wimbledon, walked past a spectator on the way to his match. He overheard her telling a friend, in expletive-laden and anti-Scottish language, that she had just spotted him.\n\n\"I was like, What? I was 19. This is my home tournament.

Roger Federer was transcendent, described as a 'god', especially at Wimbledon. Rafael Nadal had the grit, the determination, the never-say-die attitude.\n\nNovak Djokovic, another relative newcomer trying to upset their duopoly, defied belief, limbs bending every which way, equipped with an endurance level and mental strength few can match.\n\nBut Murray? Murray was the most human. A man who sometimes looked as if he actively hated the sport of tennis. No-one could ever accuse Murray of hiding his emotions. And that rubbed up some the wrong way.\n\nHe was accused of being whingey, of being anti-English, of being boring, when really he was doing what we all do - getting frustrated about the job and attempting to have a laugh along with it.\n\n\"I think it's very difficult for any young player who is thrust into the spotlight to get to grips or feel comfortable with facing and understanding the media,\" said his mum Judy, speaking on Andy Murray: Will to Win, a recent BBC Sport documentary.\n\n\"One of the things in tennis is that players have to face the media after every match whether they win or lose.

The force said in a statement that after attempts to safely capture the cow “over a period of a number of hours” failed, “the decision was made to stop it using a police car”. Home Secretary James Cleverly said he would be asking for an urgent explanation, describing the actions as \"heavy handed\". The RSPCA said the police response, which saw the animal hit twice by a marked vehicle in Staines-on-Thames, \"appears disproportionate\".\n\nFootage shared online shows a marked vehicle ramming into the cow, which appears to be stunned and tries to get to its feet, before being hit a second time. In the 26-second video, bystanders can be heard reacting in shock as the cow is struck by the vehicle. An eyewitness told BBC News the incident was \"distressing for everyone\" who saw it.

{"context": "Israelis using gardening tools to fight wildfires sparked by Hezbollah rockets\n\nDean Sweetland is one of a dozen residents tackling recent bushfires around Kibbutz Malkiya\n\nThree rusty water-trucks stand at the edge of Kibbutz Malkiya, on Israel’s border with Lebanon; little bigger than a family car, they look like so", "continuation": "mething out of an old cartoon. “This is all we have,” resident Dean Sweetland explains. “We have just these - and the leaf-blowers - to blow the fire back onto the dead areas.” Dean, a Londoner who moved to the kibbutz eight years ago, is one of a dozen residents left to tackle recent bushfires in the area, sparked by Hezbollah rockets from Lebanon. “We’re on our own,” he says. “The flames can be six metres tall. Sometimes you just can’t get near it.” He gestures to the leaf-blowers standing in the sun.\n\nIsraeli officials say the fires - triggered by Hezbollah rockets - have burned through 3,500 acres\n\nOver the past few days, footage of the fires has made headlines in Israel. The blazes, triggered when Hezbollah rockets hit dry undergrowth in soaring summer temperatures, have burned through 3,500 acres, according to forest administrators. Monday was “a battle day”, said Israel’s Fire and Rescue Commissioner, Eyal Caspi, with 94 fires burning across these northern hills. Most are now out, or under control, but rockets fly over homes here several times a day and each one carries the potential to spark a new blaze. And there are places at the moment where firefighters don’t go. “There is a war here and in a war zone, operations are different,” Mr Caspi told Israel’s Kan News radio station. “In certain areas, where there is no immediate danger to human life... where the army knows that the firefighters can get hurt, it gives us the instruction not to enter. And I back it up.”\n\nThe fires are fuelling demands that Israel’s government take steps to end the escalating conflict with Hezbollah\n\nFrom the back terrace of his home - built from shipping containers, a few hundred meters from the Lebanese border - Dean Sweetland points out the plumes of grey smoke rising from the hills nearby, to the sound of distant bombs and fighter jets. Most of the other residents of Kibbutz Malkiya were evacuated in the days following the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October, when its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon began firing on communities here. Both armed groups are labelled as terrorist organisations by Israel, the US and others. But Dean, who used to serve in the British Army, stayed on. He is part of a group of residents from border communities who race to put out the fires that fire crews are blocked from accessing. The Israeli army, he says, is not a solution. “Especially when we’re in the line of sight for Hezbollah, they’ll see the soldiers and send a rocket,” he says. “We hear the drones when we’re putting the fires out.”\n\nThe town of Kiryat Shmona was hit by rocket fire from Lebanon on Tuesday\n\nIn the early days of the war, Dean says, tanks were parked around the kibbutz and attracting a lot of Hezbollah fire. They’ve now left, and in between the bombardments, the kibbutz is peaceful. But Dean and his neighbours feel the emptiness. Families evacuated eight months ago are still living in temporary accommodation further south. The blazes here are a vivid reminder that the Israeli government’s promise to secure these northern areas and get residents back home is still unfulfilled. “We feel like we’re the forgotten people,” Dean says. “They don’t care about the north.” The attitude among many in the country, he says, is “let it burn”. “I think we have to take out Hezbollah for 10km, maybe more,” says Yariv Rozenberg, the deputy commander of Kibbutz Malkiya’s civil defence team. “You can’t kill them all, and they won’t leave from here. But we need more army here, and we need to go back to our life – to bring our families back.” As the months go by, pressure is mounting on Israel’s government to resolve this conflict and get people home. Israel’s far-right security minister this week called for Israel to burn “all Hezbollah strongholds: destruction, war!” Others have been more measured. War with Hezbollah would be a much more difficult and dangerous conflict than the one Israel is fighting in Gaza. Hezbollah’s deputy chief, Sheikh Naim Qassem, told the Al Jazeera television station that the group was not seeking to widen the conflict but that any Israeli expansion of the war would be met “with devastation”.\n\nIsrael's prime minister threatened “very intense action” against Hezbollah during a visit to Kiryat Shmona on Wednesday\n\nBefore a meeting of the war cabinet to discuss the situation on Tuesday night, the Israeli military’s chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said the country was “approaching the point where a decision will have to be made”. The armed forces, he said, were “prepared and ready to move to an offensive”. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, visiting troops and firefighters in the northern town of Kiryat Shmona on Wednesday, said the government was prepared for “a very strong action in the north.” “One way or another we will restore security to the north,” he said. Many believe a ceasefire in Gaza would help cool the situation further north. “Gaza is the key,” Dean says. “It needs to be dealt with, one way or the other. Then Hezbollah will stop, because they’re doing this in support of Hamas.” The northern conflict is closely linked to the war in Gaza. For the past eight months, with the focus on Gaza, Israel’s leader has tried to keep this conflict contained. Now he’s facing a glaring reminder of this other front: caught between the war he hasn’t finished in the south, and the war he doesn’t necessarily want to start."}

Watch: Sunak and Starmer go head to head in TV debate\n\nRishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer have faced off in the first TV debate of the general election, with heated exchanges over tax, the NHS and immigration. The Conservative and Labour leaders got scrappy at times, forcing the host of the ITV event to intervene and urge the pair to \"lower your voices\". Mr Sunak said Labour wanted to increase tax by £2,000 - a claim Mr Starmer dismissed as \"absolute garbage\". And both leaders used the opportunity to set out their personal stories to voters, talking about how their childhood experiences had shaped their political views.\n\nFor many analysts, Mr Sunak needed a big performance after a rocky week which had seen abysmal polling for his party and the return of Reform UK le", "continuation": "ader Nigel Farage to frontline politics. He came in bullish from the start, haranguing Mr Starmer on tax policy and frequently talking over his opponent and the chair, Julie Etchingham. Debate topics were queued up by questions from the audience, the first coming from Paula from Huddersfield. She was struggling with energy and food bills, she said, and had used up all her savings - a situation the charity Citizens Advice says they are dealing with 6,000 queries, external on every day.\n\nMr Sunak insisted his plan to grow the economy was starting to work and said Labour would pay for its spending plans with \"£2,000 in higher taxes for every working family in our country\". “Labour will raise your taxes - it's in their DNA. Your work, your car, your pension - Labour will tax it,” Sunak said. Throughout the debate he repeated the £2,000 figure. Conservatives have come up with the number based on how much they say Labour's spending commitments would cost, dividing this by the number of UK households with at least one person working. While Mr Sunak suggested the costings had been worked out by impartial civil servants, they are based on assumptions made by politically appointed special advisers.\n\nOne of the most substantive policy points of the evening came with Rishi Sunak appearing to suggest he would be willing to pull the UK out of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if the Rwanda policy did not work. Mr Sunak said he believed the UK's plans were\" compliant with our international obligations\" but he added: \"If I am forced to choose between securing our borders and our country’s security or a foreign court I’m going to choose our country’s security every single time.\" Pushing back on this, the Labour leader said the UK would \"not pull out of international agreements and international law which is respected the world over\". He said he wanted the UK to be a \"respected player on the world stage, not a pariah”.\n\nMr Starmer was keen to suggest his opponent was out of touch and living in a \"different world\". Drawing a contrast between his own background and that of the prime minister was something Mr Starmer tried to do throughout, talking about the \"anguish\" of having the phone cut off after an unpaid bill as a child. He suggested this was something the prime minister did not have experience with. A clear divide between the leaders came when they were asked a \"yes or no question\" - if they had a loved one \"on a long waiting list for surgery, would you, if you felt that that was the only way forward, use private healthcare?\" It was a \"yes\" from Mr Sunak and a \"no\" from Mr Starmer - with the Labour leader talking about the NHS being in his DNA.\n\nAt different points in the debate, both were keen to highlight the role of the UK's health service in their own backgrounds. Rishi Sunak's story of growing up as the son of a GP and a pharmacist will be familiar to many - but one he would have hoped to reach a fresh audience through the debate. Similarly, Mr Starmer spoke about his wife and mother working for the NHS. He also spoke about his father being a tool maker and being the first person in his family to go to university.\n\nBoth Mr Sunak and Mr Starmer were asked to raise their hands if they would raise income tax, National Insurance or, with the exception of Labour's policy on private schools, VAT. Neither raised their hand, prompting questions about how they would pay for their policies. The debate continued to be heated as the pair explained their parties' policies on immigration, which has been thrown into the spotlight after the return of Nigel Farage as the leader of Reform UK. Mr Sunak challenged Sir Keir directly on his plans on immigration, often speaking over both his opponent and the chair, Julie Etchingham. Sir Keir responded: \"We need to smash the gangs that are running this vile trade, making a huge amount of money putting some of the most vulnerable people in boats across the Channel\", to applause from the audience. Asked about how to cut NHS waiting lists, the audience groaned loudly when Mr Sunak blamed health workers' strikes for some of the issues - but he then won applause when he added taxes should not rise to fund the NHS.\n\nThere were more groans over Mr Sunak's continued backing for his national service plan when he was asked what the Conservatives were offering the UK's young people. Mr Sunak said the plan - that would see every 18-year-old taking part in 25 days of community service and some being selected for a year of military service - could be \"transformative\". Mr Starmer dismissed the idea as \"desperate\" and said the UK did not need a a \"teenage Dad's Army\" but Mr Sunak hit back with \"all he can do is sneer at it because you don't have any ideas\"."}
{"context": "Who is participating in BBC Wales' election debate?\n\nRepresentatives of Plaid Cymru, Welsh Labour, the Liberal Democrats, The Conservative party, and Reform UK are taking part\n\nRepresentatives from the five most prominent political parties in Wales are set to trade blows in a live televised debate on Friday evening. Hosted by Bethan Rhys Roberts, the debate will be broadcast live on BBC One Wales, Radio Wales and online, at 19:00 BST. It will feature Welsh Labour leader and first minister Vaughan Gething, Conservative David TC Davies, Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth, Jane Dodds for the Lib Dems and Oliver Lewis for Reform UK. So, who are they all and what can we expect from them?\n\nMr Gething is entering his first general election as first minister of Wales\n\nVaughan Gething has been first minister, and Welsh Labour leader, since replacing Mark Drakeford in March - becoming the first black man to lead a government in Europe. Born in Zambia to a Welsh father in 1971, Mr Gething moved to the UK when he was two and was raised in Dorset before attending Aberystwyth University. After entering politics as a Cardiff councillor in 2004, Mr Gething was elected to the Senedd - then known as the National Assembly - as the member for Cardiff South and Penarth in 2011. He gained national prominence during the Covid pandemic as Wales' health minister, and later became its economy minister. Since narrowly beating Jeremy Miles to the top job on 16 March, his leadership has been mired in controversy after it was revealed his campaign accepted £200,000 from a company whose boss was twice convicted for environmental offences. On 5 June, Mr Gething lost a no-confidence vote in the Senedd, tabled by the Tories, after two Labour members were off sick and unable to vote against it. He has rejected calls to resign and has been publicly backed by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.\n\nDavid TC Davies has conceded it has been a \"difficult\" election campaign for the Tories\n\nDavid TC Davies was appointed Welsh secretary in Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government in 2022. Born in Newport in 1970, Mr Davies worked for British Steel after leaving school before going on to work as a nightclub promoter, tobacco picker and rickshaw driver, all in Australia. Back in the UK he worked as a continental lorry driver and managed his family haulage business before he was elected to the Senedd, then Assembly, in 1999. He was elected MP for Monmouth in 2005 and, prior to his cabinet appointment, chaired the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, was an assistant government whip and junior Wales Office minister. He told the BBC earlier this month that high-profile errors by top Conservatives have contributed to a \"difficult\" election campaign for the party. Mr Davies also said the 685,000 people that legally migrated to the UK in 2023 year was \"far too high\" and that he would personally want this number to be at around 100,000 to 150,000.\n\nDespite it being one of his party's core principles, Rhun ap Iorwerth has said the upcoming election is \"not an independence election\"\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth has been leader of Plaid Cymru since 2023, replacing Adam Price following a scathing report on misogyny, harassment and bullying within the party. Born in Tonteg, near Pontypridd, in 1971, he grew up in Meirionnydd before moving to Anglesey when he was five. After graduating from Cardiff University, Mr ap Iorwerth was a political reporter for BBC Wales from 1994 to 2013. He quit the broadcaster to run for Plaid Cymru in a Senedd by-election for the Ynys Môn seat in 2013, which he has held ever since. In the run up to polling day, Mr ap Iorwerth claimed that this is \"not an independence election\" and has instead focused his party's offer on building \"a stronger, more prosperous economy for Wales\". He also said some areas in Wales ", "continuation": "need more immigration, not less - blaming strained public services on lack of UK government spending, not migrants.\n\nA modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.

After graduating she trained to become a child protection social worker - which would be her career for the next 27 years. Ms Dodds was first elected leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats in November 2017. After winning a by-election for the Brecon and Radnorshire Westminster constituency in 2019, she held the seat for just three months before the Tories wrestled it back off her in that year's general election. Ms Dodds was then elected as a regional Senedd member for Mid and West Wales in 2021 and remains her party's only elected politician in Wales. She has said a good election night for her party on 4 July would be \"kicking the Tories out of Wales\". The party has heavily campaigned on improving social care, pledging to pay carers an extra £2 an hour and calling for them to be \"valued higher in society\". Ms Dodds also said she believes the electorate have moved on from the party's tuition fees u-turn when it formed a coalition government with the Tories in 2010, which preceded the Lib Dems losing all but eight seats at the following election.\n\nReform UK candidate Oliver Lewis has said the Tory party \"needs to die\"\n\nStanding as a Reform UK candidate in the Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr constituency, Oliver Lewis has said he politically identifies as \"a radical\" who wants a \"wholesale re-set of Britain’s institutions\". Born and raised in Oxford, with a Welsh grandfather, Mr Lewis worked in financial services for five years after graduating university in 2009. He is currently researching \"British state failure\" as a PhD student at Oxford University, where he also teaches British politics. Mr Lewis has refuted suggestions that his party's aim for net zero immigration could cause gaps in the workforce, including in social and health care. He said it was \"morally reprehensible\" to pull foreign labour into the health service - saying it is \"not a long-term solution to our issues\". He also shot down a potential collaboration with the Tories in future, branding the party a \"failing institution\" which \"frankly... needs to die\". The Green Party’s Anthony Slaughter will respond to the debate on BBC Radio Wales at 20:00 BST.\n\nThe debate will be broadcast live on BBC One Wales and BBC Radio Wales at 19:00 BST on Friday."}
{"context": "Tories pledge to 'back drivers' with new law\n\nThe Conservatives are promising to bring in a new law if re-elected, which they say would curb \"unnecessary restrictions\" on drivers. The plans would include \"unilaterally reversing\" the expansion of the Ulez clean air scheme in London, and giving communities referendums on low-traffic neighbourhoods. Ministers have been trying to position themselves as being \"on the side of drivers\" for some time. But Labour criticised the announcement as \"desperate stuff from a government that has run out of road\". If it retains power, the Conservative party says it would to introduce a bill to Parliament which it says would prevent any potential \"pay per mile\" taxes being introduced. Under such schemes, drivers could be charged for how far they drive, what car they drive and at what time of day. They have been floated as one potential replacement for vehicle excise duty (VED), commonly known as car tax, to plug the revenue gap as drivers switch to electric cars. VED and fuel duty that motorists pay at the pump raise billions of pounds a year for the government, but neither tax is currently levied on pure electric vehicles. There are mixed opinions on \"pay per mile\" schemes among industry figures and drivers, although the Transport Select Committee has previously said road-pricing technologies could help address congestion too.\n\nUnder the Conservatives pledge set out on Friday, it also said that it would reverse the expansion of London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone, known as Ulez. The central London Ulez, first introduced in 2019, was extended to cover the whole of Greater London last August. A £12.50 daily charge applies for entering the zone in a vehicle that does not meet emissions standards. It is aimed at tackling air pollution in the capital city but its expansion sparked protests across London, with Ulez cameras and signage also being damaged. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak took aim at Labour leaders in Westminster and Cardiff Bay, who he accused of launching a \"war on drivers\". The Conservatives say the Bill would ensure a binding local referendum on any new proposed Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes or 20mph zones, as well as existing schemes where 15% of residents in affected wards sign a petition. In March, new government guidance was issued on LTNs after a review was ordered by Rishi Sunak. It said councils would have to consider residents' views before introducing any LTNs, which are designed to reduce traffic in residential areas by restricting their use as through routes. The Welsh government reduced the restricted roads \"default\" speed from 30mph to 20mph in December last year in built-up areas like villages, towns and cities. But the process of reverting some roads from the 20mph limit will begin in September, as the policy is being \"refined\" after it drew heavy criticism from some affected drivers.

It comes as teaching union, NASUWT, says some of their members are worried about going to work as a result of a \"serious increase\" in poor learning behaviour in recent years. Latest annual figures show school exclusions have hit record levels in Wales across all measures. The Welsh government said any form of violence or abuse against staff or pupils was \"completely unacceptable\" and they were looking at proposals to improve behaviour.\n\n\"Behaviour has disintegrated over the last 20 years, you get verbally abused on a daily basis,\" Steve Mitchell told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. \"I've had a knife pulled on me in one class, I've had youngsters ignore me entirely.\" There were more than thirty thousand fixed term exclusions - of less than five days - according to school census figures for the year 2022-23 academic year. The main reasons were verbal abuse, threats to staff and persistent disruptive behaviour, with the rate at its highest in Blaenau Gwent, Torfaen and Denbighshire. Figures were also far higher for pupils with additional learning needs, including those with attention deficit disorder.\n\nExclusions for verbal abuse, disruptive behaviour and threats to staff are at an all time high\n\nMr Mitchell said the issue came down to improper funding and a lack of specialist schools, adding pupils with additional learning needs were being placed in mainstream schools and causing disruption to other learners. He also put some of the poor attitudes down to the Covid-19 pandemic, suggesting children did not want to return to structure, so standards changed as a result. \"The children have lost a lot of their socialising skills. They don't want to be there, this is a hard battle,\" he said. Parents also have a role to play in the disorder, Mr Mitchell added. \"You're fighting on two fronts - kids and parents. \"Teachers are leaving the profession and not being replaced.\"\n\nThe figures were \"not surprising\" to NASUWT policy officer, Sion Amlyn\n\nThe NASUWT union said some of its members faced \"verbal abuse, violence and aggression\" from pupils.

Farage told the BBC the idea was \"complete news to me\" and \"I’ve heard nothing of the kind\". The rumours were sparked by the Sunday Times, external, which reported Conservative Party officials were concerned about Reform using the money to wipe their party out at the next election. Mr Musk's father Errol in an interview with GB News, external, suggested his son, whose grandmother was British, could take UK citizenship to get round foreign donation rules.\n\nMr Musk is a prominent critic of Labour Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and has backed Reform UK to form the next government in posts on his social media platform X.

{"context": "European retailers are rushing to place their Christmas orders early as soaring shipping costs and trade route disruption threaten holiday deliveries, experts say. For the last few months, vessels belonging to Western firms have been attacked in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels backing Hamas in its war with Israel, driving shipping prices up. Container prices, which peaked in January and briefly declined, have rebounded sharply in recent weeks. One business told the BBC that increased costs were likely to feed through to the price of big-ticket items such as white goods.\n\nNick Glynn, boss of the Buy It Direct group, owns several online retailers including Appliances Direct and Laptops Direct, which are having to plan and book well in advance to make sure their shipments arrive on time. Because they are planning ahead, he said he didn't think Black Friday and Christmas stock would be affected. But he said: \"It impacts cash and warehouse space as suddenly you have to store the goods for longer. You can't risk ordering later.\" Mr Glynn explained that the spot rate - the current price for immediate delivery of goods - has dramatically increased in recent weeks from $4,500 to $7,500 (£3,500 to £5,900). \"This makes a massive impact on big bulky items, especially those that have low margins such as furniture, barbecues, and kitchen appliances,\" he said. There was \"no way\" most online retailers could absorb those price increases on big-ticket items, he said. \"So unfortunately for consumers, the next few months will see significant rises on these big-ticket items,\" he added.\n\nDisruptions caused by Yemen's Houthi movement have limited the global supply of shipping space and containers. The Houthi rebels have already launched attacks on more than 50 ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.\n\nGlobal shipping routes have been disrupted by the attacks on vessels in the Red Sea\n\nShipping costs have soared as a result. The average cost of shipping a 40ft container now exceeds $4,000, a 140% increase from 2023, according to freight market tracker Xeneta. Peter Sand, Xeneta's chief analyst, said that importers have learned many lessons from the pandemic including that \"the most straightforward way to protect supply chains is to ship as many of your goods as you can as quickly as possible\". \"That is what we are seeing with some businesses telling us they are already shipping cargo for the Christmas period - in May,\" he said. Typically, retailers start importing goods for the Novem", "continuation": "ber Black Friday sales and Christmas shopping season between late summer and autumn. Sue Terpilowski, from the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, agreed, saying companies are realising that disruption to the Red Sea route caused by Houthi attacks could last until the autumn. \"To avoid headlines 'Christmas is cancelled, there's nothing in the shops', people are now actually bringing forward their shipments,\" she said. \"So they'll be here in good time allowing any eventualities that might happen while they are at sea.\"\n\nThe attacks on ships have forced owners of vessels travelling between Asia and Europe to take a longer route around Africa, and so ships are starting their journeys earlier to allow for the extra time needed for the diversion. \"The effects of the diversions from the Red Sea that started last December are only now becoming apparent, with vessels on the Asia-Europe trade needing more than 100 days on a rotation by circumventing Africa,\" said Dominique Nadelhofer, from Kuehne + Nagel, a major sea logistics firm. He added that the rotation of container equipment has also been disrupted, and said only around 50% of global container shipping is currently completed on time. As well as concerns about potential future Houthi attacks, there are also growing fears that as naval forces focus on countering the Houthi rebels, the resulting reduction in maritime patrols elsewhere may provide Somali pirates with opportunities to increase their activities."}

It's hard to exaggerate just how completely devastated the landscape is in this French Indian Ocean territory, after the storm tore through the islands on Saturday. Rolling hills previously covered in coconut trees now look barren and black. The leaves of trees have been blown off and their trunks are horizontal. The airport's signal tower has been mangled by the 220km winds. Even the nearest airport hotel - a solid structure and one of the few places with working wi-fi and electricity on the island - has a badly damaged roof and broken windows.\n• None Tens of thousands without water in Mayotte as curfew brought in\n\nAt least 31 people are reported by French officials to have died, but thousands are still missing and there are fears the number of dead could rise dramatically. A state of exceptional natural disaster has been declared for the territory, which is one of the poorest parts of France with many residents living in informal settlements. Similar scenes of devastation on Mayotte's other main island Grande-Terre greeted French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday morning as he arrived with four tonnes of food and health aid.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron visited the island on Thursday, arriving with food and health aid\n\nBut as he surveyed the damage, some say the level of destruction here is a direct result of his underinvestment in the island. With his government currently in disarray, and a fierce debate around migration in France, Mayotte finds itself at the centre of a political storm as well as a physical one. The thousands of illegal migrants on the island have long been a conundrum for the French government, and now some in France are arguing that providing too much help to the territory would encourage more migrants to come. In the meantime, the residents of France's poorest department are still waiting for food, water and shelter. As we landed a large downpour came in, filling the buildings whose roofs have been blown off with water. It's just one example of some of the difficulties that the residents of Mayotte have been living with for almost a week.\n\nPart of the roof at an airport hotel in Mayotte was damaged by Cyclone Chido\n\nThe state of emergency declared for Mayotte is designed for France's overseas territories to allow administrative barriers to be overcome in order to deal with the crisis more quickly and effectively.

A newly imposed curfew requires people to stay in their homes for six hours overnight to prevent the possibility of looting. Chido - the worst storm to hit the archipelago in 90 years - brought wind speeds of more than 225km/h (140mph) on Saturday, flattening areas where many live in informal structures with sheet metal roofs and leaving fields of dirt and debris. After Mayotte, the storm hit the African mainland, killing at least 45 people in Mozambique and 13 in Malawi."}

They put the puppet on Virginia's lap and I sat on Andrew's lap, and they put the puppet's hand on Virginia's breast, and Andrew put his hand on my breast, and they took a photo,\" says Ms Sjoberg's deposition.\n\nPressed by lawyers on the seating arrangements, she said: \"Whether we were on a couch or a chair, I just remember the boobs part, the hand on the boobs.\"\n\nMs Sjoberg, then aged 20, had been at college when she had been recruited by Maxwell, initially she believed as an assistant before finding that she was encouraged to deliver sexual massages for Epstein, which she resisted.\n\nShe believed that Virginia Giuffre (", "continuation": "then called Roberts) was younger, aged 17, as she hadn't been able to get into a casino as they'd intended.\n\n\"Jeffrey said, 'Great, we'll call up Trump and we'll go to - I don't recall the name of the casino, but - we'll go to the casino',\" she said of the trip to New York.\n\nBut Ms Giuffre had been too young to go inside.\n\nMs Sjoberg described Ms Giuffre, who the same year would appear in a photograph with Prince Andrew in London, as seeming as though she \"did not have a family\".\n\nMaxwell, in her deposition, said that she had once been on Epstein's Caribbean island when Prince Andrew visited.\n\nBut she said: \"There were no girls on the island. No girls, no women, other than the staff who work at the house. Girls meaning - I assume you are asking underage - but there was nobody female outside of the cooks and the cleaners.\"\n\nThe released documents also carry the claims of Ms Giuffre that she had been directed to have sex with Prince Andrew - claims denied in Maxwell's testimony.\n\nPrince Andrew has rejected any wrongdoing, including in his later settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022.\n\nIn that settlement Prince Andrew had said he \"regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others\".\n\nThe court documents, unsealed on the orders of Judge Loretta Preska, were gathered for a defamation case brought in 2015 by Ms Giuffre against Maxwell.\n\nThat lawsuit was settled out of court - but this latest batch of documents from the case has provided more details of those claimed to have contact with Epstein, including friends, business associates and also victims.\n\nMany of the individuals in the case had been described anonymously as \"John Does\" or \"Jane Does\", but now most of their real names have been released.\n\nThe judge said that many of the names were already in the public domain from media coverage or had appeared in other court cases.\n\nThere are still some names not released, such as victims or those who were minors at the time.\n\nEpstein, the disgraced financier who had cultivated links in politics, business and royalty, died in jail in 2019 while facing charges of running a \"vast network\" of underage girls for sex.\n\nPrince Andrew is no longer a working royal and as such Buckingham Palace does not comment on his behalf.\n\nIn the fall out from his connections with Epstein and his legal battle with Ms Giuffre, the prince lost his royal titles and ended his official royal duties.\n\nBut in a previous statement about links to Epstein, the palace had said that Prince Andrew \"deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent\"."}
{"context": "Both main parties' manifestos are less about detailed economic plans for office, but instead are broad marketing narratives aimed to serve the relevant central message.\n\nHow does Keir Starmer square not putting up the main rates of tax, investing in the future, not borrowing more and “never returning to austerity” in spending on public services?\n\nThe answer in the Labour manifesto is by getting the economy to grow faster with a plan to slash red tape on building homes and infrastructure.\n\nMany recent administrations have claimed this magic elixir will prevent the need for tough choices on tax and spend.\n\nLabour’s manifesto retains a Green Prosperity Plan for funding green steel, electric vehicles and clean energy, but this is significantly pared back from its original plan to pump tens of billions of pounds of borrowed money into green investment.\n\nElsewhere, such moves have indeed helped boost economic growth. But the scale of Labour’s moves are very modest compared to, for example, President Biden’s plans in the US.\n\nEven under their most optimistic timetable, the impact of such changes would take several months, probably years.\n\nIn recent days, Labour figures have started to talk publicly about lowering the trade barriers with Europe created by the Brexit deal. That they are talking about Brexit is a sign of confidence, but also a reality that some business voices are pressing Labour to embrace a way to increase productivity that doesn’t require taxpayer funds.\n\nWhat happens to Labour’s strategy if growth disappoints? It is a reasonable question given anaemic UK growth. The Labour frontbench have suggested variations of “I’m optimistic”, and “it just will”.\n\nBy autumn, there will be severe pressure on some types of spending and even on the rules Labour has decided to adhere to for borrowing. Although it was a modest manifesto in terms of the overall size of the policies, its commitments on tax and borrowing are, at the moment, a significant straitjacket on the actions of a possible Labour government.\n\nFor the Conservatives, the general narrative is that they do believe the state can now shrink from emergency pandemic and energy crisis levels. Fewer civil servants are required, they say, and the increase in working-age benefits can stop, now we are back to normal. Spending less on these things (while keeping the already planned £11bn a year increase from the income tax fiscal drag generated by those frozen tax thresholds) can free up space for slightly lowering other taxes, such as the rate of National Insurance.\n\nThis is a rather uncertain accounting basis for permanent tax cuts, but not impossible to deliver in very general terms. But there is no set of policies here that would be scored by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) as raising £12bn.

A community choir was singing the carol We Three Kings as he arrived - and they had at least one real-life King there in person to listen. \"You must be frozen. You'll need a stiff drink,\" the King said to the singers, outside in the December drizzle. The King also met Apple chief Tim Cook at the computer firm's UK headquarters in the huge former power station building, before singer Raye gave them a seasonal serenade of \"Holy Night\".\n\nThe King visited Apple's UK headquarters in the power station\n\nThe King met Apple boss Tim Cook and singer Raye on a visit to Apple HQ\n\nMuch of the power station is now a glitzy mall and Christmas shoppers got more than they bargained for as the King appeared, walking past the window of Starbucks. There can be something wistful about even the most cheerful carols - and it's been a difficult year for the King, with his health problems. But he looked cheerful here, talking to some rather gobsmacked stallholders under the Christmas lights. He always seems energised by the crowds, joking and chatting. When he was being steered on to the next part of the trip, he still dived across for ", "continuation": "an impromptu meeting with shoppers, shaking hands and facing the wall of mobile phones. The trip to the power station seemed to recharge him. He was introduced to 90-year-old Rita Kelly, who had worked here in the 1950s when the turbines were pumping out power for the capital, and who said she was \"honoured\" to talk about her memories with the King. \"Working here was a very happy time,\" she said. Although she said the King seemed to know about her \"mischievous\" side, when as a youngster she'd misguidedly tried to go upside one of the huge chimneys. Not even Father Christmas would have risked that one.\n\nThe King met Rita Kelly, a retired typist who worked in the power station in the 1950s\n\nThe King went over to speak to some surprised Christmas shoppers\n\nThe King visited the Curated Makers Market and saw the stalls for small traders and craftspeople. It was founded by Megan Jones, who has been supported by the King's Trust, formerly known as the Prince's Trust. \"People tend to go to big shops, but here they can talk to people behind the brand,\" said Soophia Foroughi, who chatted to the King about her handmade jewellery, under her label Ava and Azar. Natasha Kutrovatz, who sells her own jewellery, was delighted by the King's interest in people making a living from handmade crafts. \"As a parent, it's a much more flexible way of working,\" she said. The 1930s power station once produced a fifth of London's electricity, including supplying landmarks such as Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament. The link to Buckingham Palace had been discreetly labelled as \"Carnaby Street\" in the control room, in case anyone broke in and literally wanted to switch off the Palace lights, said a spokeswoman for the power station. With the crowds and cameras for the King's visit, it was probably louder inside the halls than when it was generating power. It's enough to shake Santa's workshop, although in a designer outlet like this, the resident Santa is living in a \"yurt\". This huge cathedral of the industrial age remains an impressive sight - and the King's mother, when she was still Princess Elizabeth, had come here in 1949 to see the power station operating. The power station, built with six million bricks, is now filled with shops and places to eat and drink and the King looked up inside this cavernous post-industrial landmark. He waved back to some rather taken-aback shoppers, looking down from the layers of walkways above. The boiler house is so big that St Paul's Cathedral could fit inside. The King is known to be interested in architecture and design - and this building, with its four chimneys looking like an upside down coffee table, was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, also responsible for the classic red phone box and Liverpool Anglican Cathedral.\n\nThe singer Raye performed at the end of the King's visit to Battersea Power Station\n\nThere's a strong sense of design for another business based in the power station - the technology firm, Apple, which the King visited after the Christmas market. Some might see parallels between Apple computers and the monarchy - a bit expensive but with many dedicated fans who think it's worth it. The King went into the Apple headquarters to meet chief executive Mr Cook and was shown an example of the firm's artificial technology, which can turn a few squiggles into a fully-fledged illustration. The computer company has worked with the King's Trust to help provide young people with digital skills and the King unveiled a plaque. Cook praised the King's \"lifelong commitment to philanthropy and the betterment of humanity\". There's a message about changed times in how it's Apple that now occupies these old buildings. This power station once used a million tonnes of coal a year, dug up in coalfields in Wales and northern England. It is tech-firms like Apple and designer shops that now fill the huge halls. And given how much the King has been photographed by mobile phones, there can few people in the country who have seen as many iPhones close up. At the end of the visit, drawings by children at a nearby primary school were projected on to the giant chimneys, climbing up into the evening sky. As the King left there was more music, with a performance by singer-songwriter Raye. After all the Christmas trees and conversations, maybe it was time for his own stiff drink."}

Dylan Kjorstad was scheduled to have a tumour on his ribs removed on 6 June at London's Royal Brompton Hospital, but the operation has been put back due to concerns about delays in blood supplies. A ransomware attack on the blood-testing firm Synnovis on 3 June led to disruption to clinical procedures at several London hospitals because the hack meant the company was unable to share information matching blood supplies to patients. Dylan's father, John Kjorstad, told the BBC his son's condition was \"very serious\" said it would be \"dreadful\" if his chances of recovery were put at risk by the delay.\n\nDylan, from Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, was diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma - a type of bone cancer - in January. Since his diagnosis, Dylan has been undergoing two cycles of chemotherapy every month with the aim of shrinking the tumour ahead of surgery. But two days before the operation, Mr Kjorstad received a call from the Royal Brompton notifying him that surgery would have to be postponed.\n\n\"It was one of those moments where you're trying to process what's being told to you. It was disbelief,\" he told the BBC. \"It's such an important, major, surgery, and the person on the other end of the phone - who was very kind and polite - said the reason that it's been cancelled is because of an IT pathology issue.\" The Royal Brompton Hospital has confirmed the surgery was postponed as a result of the cyber-attack. The operation has been rescheduled to early July, the trust said. \"Our concern would be then if his surgery is postponed further. What will the impact be on his treatment, and the tumour? Mr Kjorstad said Dylan and his family wanted to get back to normal life. \"We were really hoping that his treatment would be finished by September, so that he can get back to school and resume his education.\" \"It's a very difficult time, as you can imagine.\"\n\nThe Kjorstad family is concerned there may be further delays to Dylan's surgery\n\nCare at several hospital trusts has been disrupted by the ransomware attack on Synnovis by cyber-criminal gang Qilin, in an attempt to extort money from the firm. The attack - which is being investigated by the National Crime Agency and National Cyber Security Centre - meant blood tests and information-sharing could not be carried out using the normal computerised systems. It meant specific blood types could not be matched at the usual frequency. Those worst impacted are four London hospitals in the King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, where 134 planned procedures, including more than 180 cancer", "continuation": " surgeries, have been postponed since 3 June. A further 2,194 outpatient appointments have also been postponed, and 64 organs had to be re-diverted for use by other NHS trusts. One hospital doctor told BBC London that blood tests that once would have taken an hour were taking up to six hours. Last week, an appeal was launched for O-type blood donors, as this is suitable for any patient to receive in an emergency.\n\nDr Chris Streather, medical director for NHS London, said the hack was \"continuing to have a significant impact\" on some NHS services. “Having treatment postponed is distressing for patients and their families, and I would like to apologise to any patient who has been impacted by the incident.\" \"Staff are continuing to work hard to re-arrange appointments and treatments as quickly as possible,\" he added. Overnight on Thursday, Qilin shared almost 400GB of the private information on their darknet site. Mr Kjorstad said he thought it was \"sad\" that vulnerable NHS patients were suffering as a result of the attack. \"We're helpless against the perpetrators of these things because they sit in jurisdictions where normal law enforcement activity doesn't seem to be able to get to them. \"And it's just really sad to me that it happens to to the most vulnerable people - the people who are seeking, and needing, healthcare.\" NHS England said people should continue to attend appointments unless they are told otherwise."}

The order on Thursday comes after years of legal wrangling, with an appeals court last month upholding Bannon's 2022 criminal conviction for contempt of Congress. The right-wing podcaster was found to have illegally refused to testify before the committee investigating the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot. Bannon, 70, has denied any criminal wrongdoing and his lawyer called the ruling a \"horrible decision\".\n\nAfter Thursday's decision, Bannon said he and his lawyers would \"go all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to\". \"There's not a prison built or a jail built that will", "continuation": " ever shut me up,\" he defiantly told reporters outside the courthouse in Washington DC. He called the legal challenges against him a plan for \"shutting down the Maga movement\" - a reference to former President Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" campaign slogan. Bannon has said he was following legal advice in refusing to testify before the House committee investigating 6 January, when rioters ransacked the US Capitol with the goal of stopping the certification of Joe Biden's election win. Bannon's lawyer David Schoen, who has called the case against his client politically motivated, also vowed to appeal to a higher court. Mr Schoen said his client would have been violating Trump's invocation of executive privilege - a legal concept that allows presidents to keep some communications private - had he testified before Congress. But a three-member panel from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously rejected that argument when it upheld his conviction in May, saying his claim \"runs headlong into settled law\". \"This exact 'advice of counsel' defense is no defense at all,\" Justice Bradley Garcia wrote in that decision. A full appeals court could delay Thursday's sentencing order if it took up the case and issued its own ruling stopping its enforcement. Bannon was a key player in Trump's 2016 rise to the Oval Office and later became chief strategist at the White House. He left the administration after a violent far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, but remains a top ally of the former president. Another senior Trump aide, Peter Navarro, reported to prison in March after his own contempt of Congress conviction."}
{"context": "The mother, 36-year-old Chamchuri, was not expected to deliver twins\n\nAn Asian elephant in central Thailand has given birth to a rare set of twins, in what caretakers have described as a miracle. The mother, 36-year-old Chamchuri, was not expected to deliver twins and when she gave birth to a male calf last Friday, staff at the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace and Royal Kraal, had thought the delivery was done. But while cleaning up the first calf and helping it stand on its feet, they heard a loud thud and realised that Chamchuri had given birth to a second calf, a female. The second birth sent the mother into a panic and caretakers had to restrain her to prevent her from stepping on the female calf. One caretaker was hurt in the melee. Dramatic footage on social media showed a crowd of caretakers - known locally as mahouts - frantically separating the female calf from the mother, with blood from the birth still visible on her hind legs. Twins occur in only one percent of elephant births and male-female are even more rare, according to Save the Elephants, a research organisation. \"Once we pulled the second baby elephant out, away from the mother, the baby stood up. We were all cheering because it’s a miracle,\" veterinarian Lardthongtare Meepan told the BBC. \"We’ve always wanted to see elephant twins but not everyone can see this because it doesn’t happen a lot,\" said Dr Meepan, who grew up at the elephant park, and is herself a mother of twins. Charin Somwang, a 31-year-old mahout, broke his leg while restraining the mother. \"I was so happy, I couldn’t feel the pain,\" he told the BBC, adding he felt the extent of the injuries only when he was brought to the hospital. \"It’s normal that the new mother will always try to kick or push the baby... I was afraid that she might break the baby elephant, so I put myself forward and tried to block the mother from the smaller one,\" said Mr Somwang, who has been working at the park for 15 years. Elephants are considered sacred in Thailand, where a majority of the population is Buddhist. They are also a national symbol. Since the birth, the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace and Royal Kraal has featured the twins in live streams on social media. Park visitors, including children, are also allowed to see the twins, but only after disinfecting their footwear and their hands. A sign near the nursery reads: \"Please don't touch the elephant babies\". They will be named seven days after birth in accordance with Thai custom. At 55kg (121lb) the female calf is slightly smaller than usual and has to step on a stool during feeding with her mother. Her brother is heavier at 60kg.\n\nThe female calf is slightly smaller than usual and has to step on a stool during feeding\n\nThe park claims its elephants were rescued from begging on the streets. In 1989, Thailand banned logging in natural forests, leaving mahouts who worked in that industry jobless. This forced them to make elephants perform tricks for tourists in exchange for money. This practice was outlawed in 2010 - though there are still rare cases of this happening. In Ayutthaya, Thailand's former capital, some elephants carry tourists on their backs to temples and historic ruins. Conservationists oppose elephant riding as they say this stresses the animals out and amounts to abuse. An earlier report by the World Animal Protection (WAP) says that harsh methods are used to get a wild elephant to carry a human on its back. The process starts soon after it is captured. It is often referred to as \"breaking-in\" or \"crush\". Aside from Ayutthaya, elephants have also become tourist draws in highland villages in Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai in the north, where tourists can feed them with bananas, go walking with them and bathe them with mud.

Meanwhile, visitors continue to flock to the park in Ayutthaya to see the twin babies, as they await their names. They walk in a small pen covered with hay as they roll their trunks on their mother's leg. \"I am always happy when I see elephant gives birth,\" said Mr Somwang, their mahout who is recovering from injury. \"It doesn’t need to be twins. Elephant babies always bring joy,\" he said."}

{"context": "It is what it is - boys, 12, Snapchat after murder\n\nOne boy was pictured on the day of Mr Seesahai's death with a machete down his trousers\n\nIt's the morning after the death of 19-year-old Shawn Seesahai in Wolverhampton. Two 12-year-olds and some friends are talking on Snapchat after a video of the police cordon around the murder scene is shared in a group chat. The conversation makes for difficult reading. \"Someone got stabbed, everyone talking abt (sic) it, literally everyone, everyone knows.\" One of the pair responds with a voice note. \"It is what it is,\" he says, before they share a final exchange.\n\nShawn Seesahai had come to the UK from Anguilla to get cataracts treatment\n\nThe boys blamed each other, but a jury agreed both had been responsible for Shawn Seesahai's death, even if only one had struck the fatal blows with the machete in the park in November. They become the youngest murderers convicted since Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were detained for killing James Bulger, more than 30 years ago.\n\nThe machete used to kill Shawn was found under the bed of one of the boys\n\nDressed smartly in court, the pair looked like typical 12-year-olds. But one seems to have had a fascination with knives. The internet search history of the boy who owned the machete showed he spent a lot of time searching for similar weapons. He had posed for a photo with the murder weapon and boasted about it to two girls who had been with the pair in the park that day. One of the girls told police it was not unusual for him to carry the machete and the two boys would pass it between them. On the day of the encounter with Shawn, one of them pulled the machete out of his trousers before saying to him, \"keep stepping\". Moments later the vicious attack began.\n\nThe two boys were flanked by specialist intermediaries throughout the trial\n\nAlthough it is rare for anyone this age to be tried for such a serious offence, the West Midlands has the highest rate of knife crime in the country. There have been warnings from youth workers that more very young children are carrying bladed weapons, and that getting hold of them has become too easy. The officer in charge of the investigation, Det Insp Damian Forrest, described the case as \"exceptional\". \"It’s not the first case I’ve investigated involving a young man losing his life to knife crime, but it's the first time I've looked at two 12-year-olds being responsible, and that's something that took me by surprise and will stay with me,\" he said.\n\nOne of the boys had an image of a sword on his mobile phone\n\nSpecial arrangements had to be made at the trial because of the defendants' ages. The boys sat in the main well of the court instead of the dock. Alongside them were family members and specially trained staff to help them understand proceedings. The trial took place in one of the smaller courts in Nottingham to crea", "continuation": "te a less intimidatory atmosphere. None of the legal staff wore wigs or gowns and instead dressed in business suits. The court sessions were reduced to roughly 40 minutes and longer breaks were taken than there would normally be in an adult trial. The court day finished earlier at 15:30 so the boys would not become too tired, and they were offered fidget toys to aid with concentration.\n\nThe attack was captured on CCTV but it was unclear what exchange took place\n\nTrials involving very young children often lead to intense debate about whether there are societal lessons to be learned. It happened in 1968 when Mary Bell was convicted of the manslaughter of two children, aged four and three - the first on the day before she turned 11, and the second a few weeks later. It happened again after Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, both aged 10, murdered two-year-old James Bulger in 1993.\n\nThis case begs the question - how did a 12-year-old boy get hold of a machete? It's not clear, but police think it may have been bought online. It bears striking similarities to Ronan Kanda's murder, which happened about two-and-a-half miles away just 18 months earlier. He was attacked by two 17-year-olds outside his home with a machete in a case of mistaken identity. His killers had also bought that weapon online.\n\nWeapons like those used in both murders are legally available to buy online to over-18s, although it is illegal to carry them without \"good reason\". The government had announced plans to tighten the law, external, but it is not clear now what will happen after the general election. \"We have to block all avenues and not allow these weapons to be so easily accessible,\" Ronan Kanda’s sister, Nikita, said. \"The government definitely needs to do more. They need to act fast because too many lives are being lost now.\" Her brother’s murderers managed to bypass rules that prevent under-18s buying such weapons, and the boy who bought the machete used to kill Shawn Seesahai said he bought it for £40 from a \"friend of a friend\". Questions remain about whether weapons like machetes ought to be allowed for sale in this country, as do fears that very young children can get their hands on them, and are not afraid to use them."}

{"context": "The South Korean president's declaration of martial law came as a surprise to South Koreans and the rest of the world\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s future is hanging in the balance after a chaotic night during which he dramatically declared martial law and then withdrew it just as suddenly, plunging the country into turmoil. Yoon, who won the top job by a whisker in 2022, was already deeply unpopular and under growing pressure since losing parliamentary elections in April, regarded as a vote of confidence on his time in office. He’s been plagued by personal problems too. Last month he apologised in a televised address to the nation for a string of controversies surrounding his wife that included allegedly accepting a luxury Dior handbag and stock manipulation. Now he’s facing demands that he resign and lawmakers have said they will move to impeach him.\n\nTuesday night’s short-lived attempt to impose martial law took everyone by surprise. It sent lawmakers scrambling to the National Assembly in Seoul to vote against the order. Outside, police had assembled as thousands of protesters gathered in fury. The same crowd erupted in cheers when Yoon backtracked within hours and declared he would withdraw the martial law order. That he would play such a high-stakes game, and then back off so easily, came as a surprise to South Koreans and the rest of the world.\n\nYoon was a relative newcomer to politics when he won the presidency. He had risen to national prominence for prosecuting the corruption case against disgraced former President Park Geun-hye in 2016. In 2022, the political novice narrowly beat his liberal opponent Lee Jae-myung by less than 1% of the vote - the closest result the country has seen since direct elections started to be held in 1987. At a time when South Korean society was grappling with widening divisions over gender issues, Yoon appealed to young male voters by running on an anti-feminism platform. People had “high hopes” for Yoon when he was elected, said Don S Lee, associate professor of public administration at Sungkyunkwan University. “Those who voted for Yoon believed that a new government under Yoon will pursue such values as principle, transparency and efficiency.” Yoon has also championed a hawkish stance on North Korea. The communist state was cited by Yoon on Tuesday night when he tried to impose martial law. He said he needed to protect against North Korean forces and “eliminate anti-state elements”, even though it was apparent from the outset that his announcement was less about the threat from the North and more about his domestic woes. Yoon is known for gaffes, which haven’t helped his ratings. During his 2022 campaign he had to walk back a comment that authoritarian president Chun Doo-hwan, who declared martial law and was responsible for massacring protestors in 1980, had been \"good at politics\". Later that year he was forced to deny insulting the US Congress in remarks made after meeting US President Joe Biden in New York. He was caught on a hot mic and seen on camera seemingly calling US lawmakers a Korean word that can be translated as \"idiots\" or something much stronger. The footage quickly went viral in South Korea. Yoon has had some success in foreign policy, notably improving ties in his country's historically fraught relationship with Japan.\n\nYoon’s presidency has been mired in scandal. Much of it centred around his wife Kim Keon Hee, who was accused of corruption and influence peddling - most notably allegedly accepting a Dior bag from a pastor. In November, Yoon apologised on behalf of his wife while rejecting calls for an investigation into her activities. But his presidential popularity remained wobbly. In early November, his approval ratings tumbled to 17%, a record low since he took office. In April, the opposition Democratic Party won the parliamentary election by a landslide, dealing a crushing defeat for Yoon and his People Power Party. Yoon was relegated to a lame duck president and reduced to vetoing bills passed by the opposition, a tactic that he used with “unprecedented frequency”, said Celeste Arrington, director of The George Washington University Institute for Korean Studies. This week, the opposition slashed the budget the government and ruling party had put forward - and the budget bill cannot be vetoed. Around the same time, the opposition was moving to impeach cabinet members, mainly the head of the government audit agency, for failing to investigate the first lady. With political challenges pushing his back against the wall, Yoon went for the nuclear option - a move that few, if any, could have predicted. “Many observers worried in recent weeks about a political crisis because of the confrontation between the president and the opposition-controlled National Assembly,” said Dr Arrington, “though few predicted such an extreme move as declaring martial law.” President Yoon's declaration of martial law was a \"legal o", "continuation": "verreach and a political miscalculation\", according to Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. \"With extremely low public support and without strong backing within his own party and administration, the president should have known how difficult it would be to implement his late-night decree,\" Dr Easley told the BBC. \"He sounded like a politician under siege, making a desperate move against mounting scandals, institutional obstruction, and calls for impeachment, all of which are now likely to intensify.\"\n\nOn Wednesday morning South Koreans emerged from one of the most chaotic nights in recent memory\n\nYoon has drawn ire from politicians on both sides, as hastily-gathered lawmakers - including some from Yoon’s party - voted to lift martial law on Tuesday night. The opposition Democratic Party is trying to impeach Yoon, and even Yoon’s own party leadership has demanded the president’s withdrawal from the party. Yoon’s senior aides offered to resign en masse on Wednesday, Yonhap news agency reported. Opposition leader Lee is projecting optimism, telling reporters that Yoon’s “illegal declaration of martial law” is a “decisive opportunity to break the vicious cycle and return to normal society”. The repercussions of Tuesday night are set to ripple beyond South Korea’s borders. Yoon’s announcement has rattled South Korea's allies. Officials in the US, a key ally, said they were caught off guard by Yoon’s announcement, and are urging South Korea to resolve the crisis “in accordance with the rule of law”. Japan says that it is monitoring the situation in South Korea with “exceptional and serious concerns”. Meanwhile, North Korea, which has ratcheted up tensions with the South in recent months, may “attempt to exploit divisions in Seoul,” said Dr Easley. Anger is still sweeping South Korea. On Wednesday protesters streamed onto the streets condemning Yoon. One of the country’s largest labour unions with over one million members is calling on workers to go on strike until he resigns. It is unclear what Yoon plans to do. He has yet to make a public appearance since the fiasco. “He was increasingly unpopular for the way he has dealt with the problems that have been raised with his own conduct and the conduct of the first lady,” former South Korean foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha told the BBC Newsday programme. “The ball is in the president’s court to find a way out of this corner that he has put himself in.” But no matter how Yoon chooses to play it, his botched martial law declaration may already be shaping up to be the last straw that breaks his shaky presidency."}

{"context": "Scotland manager Steve Clarke has much to ponder before Wednesday's game against Switzerland\n\nThere is no room for error now. Scotland take on Switzerland in Cologne on Wednesday knowing something other than another defeat must be salvaged to realistically keep their Euro 2024 dream alive. There were so many talking points as to where it all went wrong in the 5-1 hiding by Germany on matchday one and BBC Sport Scotland's pundits have tried to answer them...\n\nAngus Gunn came in for criticism for some of the goals conceded at the Allianz Arena on Friday night, with some pundits and fans suggesting a switch with either Zander Clark or Liam Kelly may be on the cards Leanne Crichton: The goalkeeper situation doesn't change in my opinion. I don't think you change it after the first game, regardless of how you feel about the performance. I don't think Zander Clark or Liam Kelly would be a huge difference, simply because Gunn has been Scotland's number one in the qualifying campaign. There has to be a bit of belief instilled in Gunn and that can come from one moment, a big save or something early in the game. I don't see any reason to change, although I clearly have been critical of Angus for the first, his part in the third, and for not being better for the fifth goal on Friday. But I wouldn't change him. He's earned the right through qualification. I still think he's the best goalkeeper in the squad, although Zander Clark is pushing for that. Steven Thompson: It wasn't Angus Gunn's best game on Friday by a long stretch, but he's the number one and I don't think [manager Steve] Clarke will change it. We've got good alternatives. I just think he won't change it so early in a tournament. That's not a part of the pitch we need to be messing with at this moment.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nScotland's back line was exposed repeatedly by the Germans on Friday. Centre-half Ryan Porteous will be missing through suspension, so what about the right side of the defence? Crichton: Clarke is renowned for being loyal and consistent with his team selection, so again I don't see too much changing. Grant Hanley will come in and replace Ryan Porteous. Potentially you might see a change at right-wing-back because there's been a lot of noise made about that. Through no fault of his own, but I don't think Anthony Ralston has played enough games this season to merit playing back-to-back games. So you might get James Forrest going in there, which I'd not object to. Ross McCrorie may be a similar gamble to Ralston, but he's a good athlete. McCann: I'd bring Hanley into the middle, move Jack Hendry to the right, and Kieran Tierney to the left of the back three. On the right, I'd go quite aggressive. I've done it myself and used a winger as a wing back. You can do it if you've got guys in the right centre-back position who are good enough and quick enough to cope with playing a slightly more aggressive forward player. For me, that right wing-back is Forrest. He's better coming inside, but if we can have him having a go at Michel Aebischer, who scored and created a goal against Hungary... he's a left-footed right wing-back. If we can get Forrest going at him on his left foot on the outside, it might give us ammunition. Thompson: I would change the formation and go with a four if it was up to me, but clearly it isn't. And quite right, too! I'd go with McCrorie, Hendry, Tierney and Andy Robertson.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThere have been wild cries for Billy Gilmour to be starting in Cologne after his presence was missed in midfield in Munich. Crichton: Billy Gilmour will come in and I think Ryan Christie will drop out. That's how you solve that. McCann: I actually left Billy out of my selection for Germany because I thought we needed Christie to give us more going forward. I did feel Stevie would go pretty deep with the formation - and we all know what happened. But I thought we missed Billy's composure and bravery on the ball - and taking risks to get us forward. I'd play him and Callum McGregor in a deeper position and move Scott McTominay forward with McGinn like a box. Thompson: I'd play a 4-2-3-1 with Gilmour and McGregor as the two. I think Gilmour will play. There were a lot of people who said he should have played against Germany, but I understand the reasons why he didn't. But, without a doubt, I think he'll play here.\n\nScotland failed to register a shot on target against Germany - their goal was an own goal - with Che Adams up front. He had little service to be fair, but should Lawrence Shankland come in? Crichton: I think they'll back Che Adams, although I'd love Lawrence Shankland to start with McGinn and McTominay supporting. Whether that'll happen, I'm not entirely sure. That's no disrespect to Adams. He had no service, no supply and it was basically a running exercise. He was off at half-time, but not because of him. Sometimes in big games chances are at a premium, but Lawrence's goal return tells me he may just take one. His general link-up and all-round play is fantastic. He's played under an enormous amount of pressure with Hearts as a link man as well as being a goal threat. Thompson: It's maybe a bit unfair on Adams as he was sacrificed at half-time because of the sending off on Friday. But I feel we need goals and to create chances.

{"context": "US scraps $10m bounty for arrest of Syria's new leader Sharaa\n\nAhmed al-Sharaa met with US officials in Damascus\n\nThe US has scrapped a $10m (£7.9m) reward for the arrest of Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, following meetings between senior diplomats and representatives from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Assistant Secretary of State Barbara Leaf said the discussion with Sharaa was \"very productive\", and he came across as \"pragmatic\". The US delegation arrived in the capital, Damascus, after HTS overthrew the Bashar al-Assad regime less than a fortnight ago. Washington still designates it as a terrorist group. A State Department spokesperson confirmed that the diplomats discussed \"transition principles\" supported by the US, regional events and the need to fight against IS.\n\nThe spokesperson also said the officials were seeking further information on American citizens who disappeared under Assad's regime, including journalist Austin Tice, who was abducted in Damascus in 2012, and psychotherapist Majd Kamalmaz, who disappeared in 2017. A US embassy spokesperson earlier said a news conference involving Ms Leaf had been cancelled due to \"security concerns\". However during a later briefing, Leaf denied that, insisting \"street celebrations\" were the cause of the delay. The visit is the first formal American diplomatic appearance in Damascus in more than a decade. It is a further sign of the dramatic shifts under way in Syria since the ousting of Assad, and the speed of efforts by the US and Europe, also leaning on Arab countries, to try to influence its emerging governance. The visit follows those of delegations in recent days from the UN and other countries including the UK, France and Germany.

Washington is effectively laying down a set of conditions before it would consider delisting the group - a critical step which could help ease the path towards sanctions relief that Damascus desperately needs. Meanwhile, US Central Command (CENTCOM) confirmed that IS leader Abu Yusif and two of his operatives had been killed in an air strike in the Deir al-Zour province of north-eastern Syria. It said in a statement on Friday that the airstrike was launched on Thursday and carried out in an area that was formerly controlled by the Assad regime and Russian forces supporting his government.

Watch: Mangione's extradition to New York explained in 73 seconds\n\nThe legal case against Luigi Mangione expanded on Thursday, with the federal government filing four criminal charges against him, including one punishable by death. Mr Mangione, who is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson earlier this month, arrived by helicopter in Manhattan in the afternoon after being extradited from Pennsylvania. He disembarked in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs and, surrounded by officials and armed guards, walked before cameras and journalists to the van that would take him to court. The 26-year-old will remain behind bars as his lawyers said that they would not yet present an application for bail.\n\nDuring a 15-minute hearing, where he appeared wearing a blue sweater and khaki pants with his feet shackled, a judge read out loud the four federal charges against him. Mr Mangione's hearing was packed with reporters, members of the public and court staff. Several people outside protested in support of him, holding a sign saying: \"Luigi freed us\". The level of protection being provided to Mr Mangione is equivalent to what visiting diplomats and dignitaries typically receive when they visit New York, Felipe Rodriguez, a former detective sergeant who served on the NYPD for 21 years, told the BBC. Mr Rodriguez, who now teaches at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, said Mr Mangione was receiving \"extreme protective executive protection\" – or what officers there simply call \"protecting the package\". New York Mayor Eric Adams was part of a throng police officials who met Mr Mangione's chopper when it landed in Manhattan. Mr Mangione's day began with a hearing in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested on 9 December, to discuss extraditing him back to New York, where the shooting occurred. He appeared shackled in the orange jumpsuit, and afterwards was taken by plane to an airport on Long Island, New York, then to Manhattan. Mr Mangione was arrested at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, five days after Mr Thompson, the UnitedHealthcare CEO, was shot and killed. He was found with a fake ID and so-called \"ghost gun\", police have said. During the New York hearing on Thursday, Mr Mangione sat between his two lawyers - Karen Friedman Agnifilo, and her husband, Mark Agnifilo, who also is representing rapper Sean \"Diddy Combs\" in his sex trafficking case.

New York prosecutors began to share evidence in their case against Mr Mangione with a grand jury last week. The evidence against him includes a positive match of his fingerprints with those discovered at the crime scene, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. According to New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg, the suspect arrived in New York City on 24 November, staying in a Manhattan hostel while using a fake ID before carrying out the attack against Mr Thompson 10 days later. In addition to the ghost gun - a gun assembled from untraceable parts - and fake ID, a passport and a handwritten document indicating \"motivation and mindset\" also were found on Mr Mangione when he was arrested, police said."}

One farmer told the BBC he faced “constant warfare” against balaclava-clad thieves breaking into his farmyard and also against gangs of illegal hare-coursers. A new report by the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) warns that police forces in England and Wales that cover large rural areas are \"in crisis\" and need more funding to fight back against the organised gangs. The National Police Chiefs’ Council said forces were “strengthening their response” to rural crime.\n\nA recent study found there were 22 serious organised criminal gangs active across the countryside\n\nThe CLA’s findings come after a Durham University report earlier this year , externalfound there were 22 serious organised criminal gangs active in the countryside Simon Porter, 65, who farms 570 hectares (1,408 acres) near the village of Crondall in Hampshire, has had to install £10,000 worth of farm defences, including three-tonne concrete blocks at entrances to his field, to keep the gangs out. He has been targeted by thieves and violent gangs breaking onto his land for illegal racing and gambling on dogs chasing hares. Mr Porter told the BBC: “If we didn’t have all our defences, the countryside would simply become even more lawless and it would be an unsafe place in which to live because these people are hugely threatening. “It is a war. I’m not trying to be dramatic. It literally is like that.”\n\nMr Porter, who also runs a vineyard, said the gangs of thieves were targeting farms for quad bikes and expensive tools, often ramming the roller shutters on storage sheds to break in. Local farmers, like many across the country, are now using mobile phone chat groups to warn each other of any suspicious activity, day or night. “We have to leave our phones on 24 hours a day so it is just that constant anxiety,” said Mr Porter. “You’ll get a call in the night so you have to get up, go out into the dark and walk around. That can be quite intimidating if you see a vehicle coming along at night. “It is living on a bit of a cliff edge all the time for both us and our families.”\n\nVictoria Vyvyan, the CLA’s president, said farmers were in “a constant and expensive battle to keep criminal gangs at bay”\n\nMr Porter said his local beat officers were “trying to do their best but with resources that are very limited”. Inspector Cath MacDonald, of Hampshire Constabulary, told the BBC that officers “take rural crime very seriously, as the impacts on the livelihoods of those affected can be devastating”. The constabulary is one of the 36 forces covering the countryside in England and Wales that were sent FOI inquiries by the CLA looking to produce a snapshot of how the police’s fight against rural crime is being resourced. Hampshire has its own dedicated rural crime team with specialist equipment - specifically high-powered torches, surveillance drones, 4x4 vehicles, thermal spotters, microchip scanners and mobile ANPR cameras.\n\nMany police forces have schemes that rely on information given by local farmers to build up a picture of rural crime\n\nBut the CLA found that, of the 20 police forces that provided information, five do not have a rural crime unit and no force had more than 0.7% of officers dedicated to tackling criminals operating in the countryside. Durham Constabulary, which polices a predominantly rural area, is one of the forces that does not have a dedicated rural crime team. A spokesman for the force said it instead relied on information supplied by locals as part of a new scheme monitored by a dedicated intelligence officer. He said rural communities “are our eyes and ears and have proved time and time again that their assistance is making an impact and helping us drive down rural crime across our county\". The FOI responses also revealed that Leicestershire Police has allocated just eight officers out of a total force of 2,252 to its rural crime team.\n\nBut Sergeant Rob Cross, from Leicestershire Police’s rural crime team, told the BBC that it was “one of most active rural crime teams in the country”. Sgt Cross said that there had been a drop in rural and wildlife crime in the first six months of this year compared to the same period last year and that more than £1.5m worth of stolen farming equipment has been recovered. Victoria Vyvyan, the CLA’s president, said that \"the rural pol", "continuation": "icing system is in crisis” with some farmers left feeling like they are in “a constant and expensive battle to keep criminal gangs at bay”. “More people in the countryside are reaching the conclusion that they can't always count on the police to keep their communities and property safe,” she added.\n\nHigh-value farm vehicles and machinery are being targeted by organised gangs with links to organised crime\n\nA National Police Chiefs’ Council spokesman said all chief constables were working to ensure the police were “as visible and approachable as possible” in rural communities. He said: “Police forces are strengthening their response to rural crime, with objectives set against a national rural affairs strategy.” The latest annual national rural crime survey, external shows rural offences had risen by 22%, with a total estimated cost of £49.5m in insurance claims. The National Rural Crime Network (NRCN) - an organisation made up of police and crime commissioners and organisations representing rural communities - has called for the future government to fund new specialist rural crime co-ordinators, rural crime training for all officers and control centre staff and greater use of new technology.\n\nA spokesperson said: “If we are serious about smashing these gangs then we must do more to tackle rural crime.\" The Conservatives said they had established the first ever dedicated rural crime unit within the National Crime Agency in 2023 and would continue to take action to protect rural communities. Labour has said it will introduce a new cross-government rural crime strategy and would increase police patrols in rural areas. The Liberal Democrats say they would scrap police and crime commissioners and invest the savings in ensuring every police force has a properly resourced rural crime team. Plaid Cymru has pledged to set up a specialist rural crime team for the whole of Wales that would recruit officers from the farming community."}

Tulip Siddiq, 42, who as the Treasury's Economic Secretary is responsible for tackling corruption in UK financial markets, is alleged to have brokered a deal with Russia in 2013 that overinflated the price of a new nuclear power plant in Bangladesh. The allegation is part of a wider investigation by Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) into Siddiq's aunt, Sheikh Hasina, who was deposed as prime minister of the country in August. A source close to Siddiq said these were \"trumped up charges\".\n\nThe source also said the allegations were \"completely politically motivated\" and designed to damage her aunt. Conservative shadow home office minister Matt Vickers said: \"The fact Labour's anti-corruption minister is reportedly embroiled in a corruption case is the latest stain on Keir Starmer's judgement. \"It is high time she came clean. The British public deserve a government that is focused on their priorities, not distracted by yet another scandal.\"\n\nDowning Street said Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had confidence in Siddiq, and she will continue her responsibility as the minister overseeing anti-corruption efforts. Siddiq has \"denied any involvement in the claims\" accusing her of involvement in embezzlement, according to the prime minister's official spokesman. But she has recused herself - or stepped back - from any political decisions involving Bangladesh, the spokesman added. The investigation is based on a series of allegations made by Bobby Hajjaj, a senior political opponent of Hasina. The BBC understands that Siddiq has not had any contact with the ACC as part of the investigation.\n\nTulip Siddiq was pictured alongside Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina and Russian President Vladimir Putin during a 2013 visit to the Kremlin\n\nThe ACC is also investigating several of Hasina's family members, including Siddiq's mother Sheikh Rehana Siddiq, and senior officials from her government. Hasina, who was in charge of Bangladesh for more than 20 years, was seen as an autocrat whose government ruthlessly clamped down on dissent. Since fleeing the country Hasina has been accused of multiple crimes by the new Bangladeshi government. Hasina is wanted by Bangladesh's International Criminal Tribunal (ICT) for her alleged involvements in \"crimes against humanity\" that took place during the demonstrations, in which hundreds were killed. Arrest warrants have also been issued for 45 others, including former government ministers who also fled the country.

Siddiq was elected MP for Hampstead and Highgate in 2015, the north London constituency neighbouring Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's seat of Holborn and St Pancras.

Hasina's main predecessor as prime minister, Khaleda Zia faced similar charges, which she also dismissed as politically motivated. As did ex-president Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who seized power as head of the army during a bloodless coup in 1982. The Bangladeshi judiciary's independence has long been questioned. Government changes often bring judicial reshuffles, with ruling parties regularly accused of targeting political opponents.\n\nCourt documents seen by the BBC show Hajjaj has accused Siddiq of mediating and coordinating meetings for the Bangladeshi officials with the Russian government to build the £10bn Rooppur Power Plant Project. It is claimed that the deal inflated the price of the plant by £1bn, according to the documents - 30% of which was allegedly distributed to Siddiq and other family members via a complex network of banks and overseas companies. In total, Hajjaj alleges £3.9bn was siphoned out of the project by Hasina's family and minister. Footage from 2013 appears to show Siddiq attended the deal's signing by Hasina and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin, recorded by the Associated Press.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

{"context": "Stronger retail sales helped the UK's economy to rebound in November, but the risk of recession remains.\n\nThe economy grew by 0.3% in November, official figures show, after it shrank during the previous month.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said the services sector led the rebound, as Black Friday sales boosted retailers.\n\nBut it said the economy had shown \"little growth\" over the past year and economists said it was a close call as to whether the UK can avoid a downturn.\n\nFigures released last year showed the UK was at risk of a recession after the economy shrank between July and September.\n\nA recession is typically defined as when the economy shrinks for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row. The UK economy will meet this criteria if it contracts between October and December.\n\nGrant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, told the BBC that November's rebound was driven by \"strong retail sales but also car leasing, computer games and fewer strikes than we've seen in previous months\".\n\n\"We have had quite a number of companies telling us they saw strong Black Friday sales which had a positive impact not just on the retail sector but also warehousing, couriers and some manufacturing sectors.\"\n\nHowever, while monthly growth was stronger than expected, the UK economy is in a fragile state and the ONS figures showed that in the three months to November, the economy shrank by 0.2%.\n\nFor the government's pledge to grow the economy by the end of 2023 to be met, there will have to be a further expansion of activity between November and December.\n\nEconomic growth is a seen as a good thing for most people because companies become more profitable, more jobs tend to be created and firms can pay employees more money.\n\nBut when growth is stagnant, or a country is in recession, people tend to feel worse off and unemployment can rise as companies cut back on spending.\n\nEconomists predict it will be touch-and-go as to whether the UK can avoid a recession.\n\nAre you affected by the issues raised in this story? Get in touch.\n\nRuth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said November's rebound \"probably means the economy escaped a recession in 2023\", but expects zero growth for the final three months of the year.\n\nWage growth on average is outpacing inflation but more than a million households face being exposed to higher interest repayments in the coming months as they re-fix mortgages. Businesses that rely on healthy consumer spending are paying the price, with consumer-facing services still over 5% smaller than before the pandemic.\n\nSamuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said it is a \"coin toss\" as to whether the UK avoided a recession at the end of last year.\n\nBut he added: \"With employment still rising and business and consumer confidence recovering, it would be overblown to label this a recession if GDP did indeed drop slightly\".\n\nThe ONS's Mr Fitzner said: \"I think it is important to remember that a recession is not just a very small negative number followed by a very small negative number. It is a significant and sustained fall in output. We don't expect to see that.\"\n\nResponding to the latest growth figures, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: \"While growth in November is welcome news, it will be slower as we bring inflation back to its 2% target.\"\n\nThe Bank of England has, until relatively recently, been raising interest rates to cool inflation, which measures the pace at which prices are rising.\n\nWhile higher interest rates can control inflation, they can also dampen economic growth.\n\nInflation has slowed to 3.9% in the year to November. While that remains higher that the Bank's 2% target, calls for interest rate cuts from some are intensifying.\n\nHowever, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has repeatedly said it is too early speculate about possible cuts.\n\nAnother source of uncertainty for the economy is the potential impact of the continuing attacks on shipping in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels.\n\nThe attacks - which have now led to air strikes by the US and UK - mean many of the world's major shipping firms have been avoiding the key route for global trade.\n\nHowever, the alternative route, around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, adds about 3,500 nautical miles to the journey, making trips longer and more expensive.\n\nCompanies such as Next and Ikea have said they are expecting delays in receiving their goods. And if the cost of shipping products to the UK increases, companies may choose to pass it on to customers through higher prices, which could add to inflation.\n\nOil prices also rose on Thursday after Iran seized a tanker off the coast of Oman. The oil tanker was heading for Turkey when armed men ordered it to sail to an Iranian port.\n\nThe BBC understands t", "continuation": "he Treasury has modelled scenarios including crude oil prices rising by more than $10 a barrel and a 25% increase in natural gas.

{"context": "Pascual Andreu doesn't plan to reopen his chocolate business after the factory was damaged by flood water\n\nPascual Andreu poi", "continuation": "nts proudly to a black-and-white photograph stuck to the wall of the premises of his chocolate-making business. Staring out from it is his grandfather, who started the company in 1914. But, as he looks around him and remembers the destruction caused by the flash floods which struck the eastern Spanish region of Valencia on 29 October, tears well up in Andreu's eyes. \"The water came in and water and mud covered everything,\" he says. \"And when it had gone, it left a terrible sight. All the stock we had was ruined, the machinery was useless.\" He adds: \"All my life working. And for what?\"\n\nThe floodwater left a six-feet-high (1.8m) mark on the wall, and although the water has now gone, mud still clings to the machines. Miraculously, the photo of his grandfather was not washed away. But, now in his sixties, and still waiting to see how much insurance money he might receive, Andreu is too disheartened to start over. The flash flood killed more than 220 people in the Valencia region, many of them caught in their cars, or on the ground floors of buildings when the tsunami-like waters hit. But as well as claiming lives, the disaster also devastated livelihoods. Valencia's chamber of commerce estimated that 48,000 companies have been affected. The towns and industrial belt surrounding the Mediterranean city of Valencia, which itself avoided the impact of the floods, were the worst hit. In total, the province of Valencia represents 5% of Spain's GDP, according to CaixaBank Research, which estimates that the disaster could reduce national economic output by one to two percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe floods caused extensive damage across the Valencia region\n\nMuch of the damage has been caused on industrial estates. Diego Romá, executive president of the federation of industrial estates in the Valencia region (Feteval), says that \"thousands and thousands of jobs are in the air\" and that a total of 58 industrial estates were affected by the flood water. \"Most companies are working hard to resume production, but unfortunately there are maybe 10 to 20% of companies which are going to close,\" he said. The legacy of 29 October is still visible on the industrial estates. Abandoned cars sit on the side of the road covered in mud, debris has been pushed up against walls and the shutters of many businesses remain closed. Electro Fernández, an electricity installation company, is one of the few which has reopened, having lost €40,000 ($42,000; £33,000) worth of tools in the floods. \"We were immediately affected 100% because we lost our tools and vehicles,\" said Patricia Muñoz, who co-owns the company with her husband. She says that they are currently working at 10% of their capacity. \"We've cleaned the place, we've got all our employees here, and we've taken action to get going again,\" she says. \"But a lot of the companies on this industrial estate, and on others are nowhere near that, they are still cleaning up. \"This has been an absolute disaster. You only realise the scale of it when you see it for yourself.\"\n\nNot far away is a car storage area, where hundreds of the 120,000 or so vehicles damaged or destroyed by the flooding have been removed from roads and piled one on top of the other. As part of a €17bn relief plan announced by the government in the first month after the tragedy, it promised to provide up to 10,000 euros to car owners to replace their vehicles. Businesses and self-employed workers are also due to benefit, with compensation for damage caused to homes and corporate premises. A furlough scheme is also in place. The Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, told congress in late November that his government was \"making a titanic effort\" to ensure that the promised funds reach those in need as soon as possible. However, not everyone is convinced. \"I think that official financial aid is badly managed,\" says Toni Milla, president of a local business association in the town of Alfafar, which was heavily affected. He says that a lot of the relief for businesses promised during the Covid pandemic did not reach its destination. \"I think this time the same thing is going to happen,\" he says.\n\nVehicles damaged in the floods have been collected and piled up\n\nValencians' faith in their authorities has already been severely shaken by the immediate response to the disaster. Protesters have been demanding the resignation of regional president Carlos Mazón, who, it emerged, was absent from his office for several hours on the day the floods struck because he was having lunch with a journalist. Many believe his administration's delay in issuing an alert to the phones of people in the region cost lives. Mazón has rejected such claims. \"We did the best we could with the information available,\" he says. Others criticise the central government for failing to deploy the military and other resources more forcefully. Sánchez, however, has insisted that his administration \"fulfilled its duties and did so from the very beginning\" of the crisis. Meanwhile, help has been provided by the private sector. Alcem-se, a charity platform set up by local supermarket entrepreneur Juan Roig, says it has distributed €35m euros in non-refundable aid to 4,600 businesses.\n\nHowever, for many, including Mr Milla, the relief may not be enough. He owned a local TV channel, an estate agency and a bar and he has only managed to reopen the latter – partially – in the wake of the October floods. He lists several nearby businesses - including a petrol station, a gym, a beautician and an optician – which he says will not reopen. But it is not just urban areas which were hit on 29 October. The Valencia region is part of an agricultural heartland in south-eastern Spain, which exports large quantities of fruit and vegetables to the rest of Europe. Twenty-five miles (40km) south of Valencia city, José España visits his orange trees. Beneath them, oranges which were washed off their branches by the floodwater lie rotting on the ground. \"Farmers always say 'next year things will get better', but right now, the mood among farmers is very pessimistic,\" he said. The agricultural association he is a member of, AVA-ASAJA, estimates that well over €1bn euros worth of damage was caused on 29 October to crops alone. \"Farmers have had a few years now in which we've been abandoned, and the floods might end up causing a few more farmers than usual to leave the industry,\" he says. \"In order to get things back to how they were before the flooding, it's going to take two or three years.\""}

As the rain lashed down the boat pulled over and they took shelter under a tin shed on the riverbank, when they were hit.\n\nBangladesh, which is blighted by extreme weather and heavy storms, suffers an average of 300 deaths by lightning every year, according to the UN.\n\nThat's compared with fewer than 20 annually in the United States, which has almost double the population.\n\nIt's a heavy burden for the South Asian nation, and for many like Mamun, who is speaking for the first time about what happened on that day in August 2021.\n\nThe 21-year-old was getting ready at his in-laws' home in the Shibganj area in the country's north-west, when he heard the crackle of thunder, minutes before he got the gut-wrenching news.\n\nHe rushed to his family, where he was confronted with a scene of chaos and confusion.\n\n\"Some people were hugging the bodies,\" Mamun recalls, \"the injured were crying out in pain… children were screaming. I was at a loss. I could not even decide who I should go to first.\"\n\nThe funerals took place on the evening of Mamun's wedding\n\nMamun lost his father, grandparents, cousins, uncles and aunts. His mother wasn't on the boat and survived the lightning attack.\n\n\"When I found my father's dead body I simply burst into tears. I was so shocked I fell sick,\" Mamun says.\n\nLater that evening, the funerals of his relatives took place - the wedding feast they were meant to enjoy was instead distributed to the homeless.\n\nMamun later got married, but says he doesn't celebrate his wedding anniversary as it triggers painful memories. \"After the tragic incident, now I am really scared of rain and thunder.\"\n\nLightning is a big killer in Bangladesh, claiming more lives annually than floods.\n\nReported deaths and injuries due to lightning have increased greatly in Bangladesh\n\nThe number of reported deaths due to lightning has also risen steeply, from just dozens per year in the 1990s.\n\nNasa, the UN and the government of Bangladesh cite increased storminess due to climate change as a reason for the increase in deadly strikes.\n\n\"Global warming, environmental changes, living patterns are all factors for the increasing death toll due to lightning,\" Md Mijanur Rahman, the director general of Bangladesh's disaster management division, told the BBC.\n\nSuch is the seriousness, that the government has added lightning strikes to the official list of natural disasters the country faces which includes floods, cyclones, earthquakes and droughts.\n\nThe majority of victims of lightning are farmers, who are vulnerable to the elements as they work the fields through the rainy monsoon months in the spring and summer.\n\nAbdullah was wearing his Barcelona shirt when he was struck by lightning\n\nA football shirt, hanging on a rickety fence, overlooking a field in the Satkhira region of Bangladesh is a poignant reminder of one of the victims.\n\nJust days earlier, the shirt had been worn by Abdullah as he went into the vast rice fields to do his day's work.\n\nNow, draped over the wooden barrier, the Barcelona football shirt is singed and frayed, the burnt edges of thread show where the lightning left its mark in May this year.\n\nAbdullah's wife of three decades, Rehana, took me to the field to tell me what happened the day she lost her husband.\n\nIt was bright and sunny as Abdullah and a group of farmers went to harvest rice. By late afternoon a heavy storm began, and a lightning bolt struck her husband.\n\n\"Some of the other farmers brought him to this roadside shop,\" Rehana says, pointing to a small shack along the lane. \"By then he was already dead.\"\n\nBack at Rehana's house, the rice Abdullah harvested a day earlier lies in fresh piles outside the small one-room dwelling.\n\nThe couple had recently taken out a loan to build a second room to extend their modest home.\n\nInside, the couple's 14-year-old son Masood is reading a book. With no primary earner, Rehana fears she will be left with a lifetime of debt and wonders how she will pay for his studies.\n\n\"The fear gripped me so deeply that now if I see a cloud in the sky, I don't even dare to let my son go outside any more,\" she says consumed by tears.\n\nRehana says she doesn't let her son outside following the death of her husband\n\nLightning is a growing concern in other countries too - including neighbouring India which has also seen a rise in the number of strikes in recent years, but a significant reduction in the number of fatalities due to a number of initiatives.\n\nThere are efforts in Bangladesh to do more to reduce the number of deaths due to lightning.\n\nActivists say more tall trees need to be planted in remote rural areas to absorb the impact of the strikes, especi", "continuation": "ally in places which have borne the brunt of deforestation.\n\nThey also call for a large-scale programme to build lightning sheds, so farmers can take safe shelter, and for broader early warning systems to alert people about possible storms.\n\nOne challenge is the poor connectivity and lack of mobile usage in the areas where people are the most vulnerable.\n\nA lack of awareness is also a challenge. Many in the country don't realise how dangerous lightning can be - few people anywhere in the world expect to be hit by a thunderbolt.\n\nFarmer Ripon Hossen - who was with Abdullah the day he was killed - never imagined what lightning would look like up close, until it struck.\n\nFarmer Ripon Hossen says he is terrified to work in the open but needs the income from farming\n\n\"There was a big loud sound, and then I saw lots of flashing lights,\" he recalled. \"It was as if a disk of fire had fallen on us. I felt a great electric shock and fell to the ground.\n\n\"After a while, I opened my eyes and saw that Abdullah was dead.\"\n\nRipon can't believe he survived. He says he's terrified to work in the open, but in this impoverished agricultural area farming is the only source of income for him.\n\n\"I cry whenever I think of my friend Abdullah,\" he says.\n\n\"When I close my eyes at night, all the memories of that day return like a flashback. I can't console myself.\""}

{"context": "Junior doctors have walked on the first day of a six day walkout\n\nNHS bosses have made more than 20 requests for striking junior doctors in England to be allowed to cross the picket line to help out services.\n\nNone of the requests made on the first strike day have been granted so far by the British Medical Association (BMA).\n\nThe union accused NHS bosses of misusing the system known as derogation and bowing to political pressure to undermine the strike.\n\nBut NHS England said they were genuine requests for help.\n\nIt said the health service was under huge pressure after the six-day walkout began on Wednesday, and NHS bosses were trying everything they could to protect patients and keep struggling services safe.\n\n\"Given this period of industrial action coincides with the most difficult time of year for the NHS, it is to be expected that more senior medical leaders will ask for allowances to be made to ensure safe levels of cover,\" the spokesman added.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has also given his backing to the requests.\n\n\"It is right the NHS does absolutely everything it can to ensure patient care,\" he said.\n\n\"These strikes are disrupting people's lives and causing an enormous amount of concern.\"\n\nThe requests are made by individual departments so some NHS trusts are thought to have made more than one request. Most involve emergency care areas, such as A&E units.\n\nThis is the ninth walkout - and longest ever - by junior doctors, and before this stoppage only a handful of requests had been made. Two of them were granted.\n\nIn a letter to NHS England boss Amanda Pritchard on Wednesday, BMA leader Prof Philip Banfield said in many cases insufficient information was being provided by the NHS to judge the merits of the request.\n\nHe said this was \"undermining\" the derogation process and placing the BMA in an impossible position.\n\n\"We are increasingly drawing the conclusion that NHS England's change in attitude towards the process is not due to concerns around patient safety, but due to political pressure to maintain a higher level of service and undermine our strike action.\"\n\nBut Matthew Taylor, of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals, criticised the BMA.\n\n\"This is more about them needing to limit the precious time they and their teams have available to filling in forms when patient safety could be at risk.\"\n\nHe pointed out his organisation has called for national exemptions to allow junior doctors to work in critical areas such as urgent cancer care and maternity services.\n\nThe trusts that made the requests are not being named.\n\nHospitals have drafted in senior doctors to cover for junior doctors who go out on strike.\n\nThis has meant that routine services have been scaled back en masse.\n\nBut since the start of the walkout on Wednesday at 07:00 GST several NHS trusts have reported problems with some declaring a critical incident, meaning bosses were concerned they could not provide critical services for patients.\n\nHow are your local NHS services coping this winter?

{"context": "Fear, fury and triumph: Six hours that shook South Korea\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. South Korea: How two hours of martial law u", "continuation": "nfolded\n\nNineteen-year-old Hwang was watching the protests in Georgia on Tuesday night's news when the images on TV suddenly changed - the spotlight was on his country after South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol announced martial law. \"I couldn’t believe what I was seeing,\" said the student, who wished to be identified only by his surname. By Wednesday afternoon, he was among the protesters standing before the National Assembly, still stunned about what had happened the night before. \"It's important for me to be here to show that we are against what Yoon tried to do,\" Hwang said. In a little less than six hours, Yoon was forced to walk back his shock announcement after lawmakers scrambled to block it. But those were chaotic hours, sparking protests, fear and uncertainty in the country that had elected him.\n\nOn Tuesday night, at 23:00 local time (14:00 GMT) President Yoon, seated in front of blue creaseless curtains, made an unexpected address to the nation. He said he was imposing martial law to protect the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea. The embattled leader is in a deadlock over a budget bill, dogged by corruption scandals and investigations into his cabinet members. What followed was a sleepless night for Seoul. Shortly after Yoon’s announcement, police lined the white metal gates outside the National Assembly building in the heart of Seoul, the building that the country’s tourism authorities have framed as “the symbol of Korean democracy”. The military then announced that all parliamentary activity was suspended under martial law. But neither that nor the heavy security presence stopped thousands from gathering in front of the assembly in concern and fury. It is easy to forget that South Korea - now a vibrant democracy - had its last brush with authoritarianism in the not-too-distant past - it only emerged from military rule in 1987. Martial law was last imposed in 1979. This was “a move I never expected to see in the 21st century in South Korea,” university student Juye Hong told BBC World Service's OS programme from Seoul.\n\nSoon after Yoon's shock announcement, the opposition's Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, hosted a live stream urging people to assemble at the National Assembly and protest there. He also asked his fellow lawmakers to make their way to the assembly to vote down the order.\n\nTensions rose quickly as a sea of dark, puffy winter coats pushed up against lines of police in neon jackets, chanting “no to martial law”. And as vehicles arrived with military units, crowds blocked them. One woman lay defiantly between the wheels of a vehicle. In stark contrast, there was a façade of normalcy across the rest of Seoul. Still, confusion enveloped the city. “The streets look normal, people here are certainly bewildered,” John Nilsson-Wright, an associate professor at the University of Cambridge, told BBC World Service from Seoul. The policeman he spoke to was “as mystified as I am,” he added.\n\nA woman lies on a road to block a vehicle transporting an army unit\n\nIt was a sleepless night for some. \"At first I was excited at the thought of not going to school today,\" 15-year-old Kwon Hoo told the BBC in Seoul on Wednesday. \"But then overwhelmingly the sense of fear settled in, that kept me up all night.\" \"No words can express how afraid I am that things might turn out like North Korea for our people,\" a South Korean who did not want to be named told BBC OS. Meanwhile, word was spreading that special forces had been deployed to the assembly building. Helicopters were heard overhead as they circled the skies before landing on the parliament’s roof. Reporters jostled in the crowd outside the gates, clicking away with their cameras. As concerns grew that the government might restrict the media, journalists in Seoul stayed in touch with one another, exchanging advice on how to stay safe. Ahn Gwi-ryeong, the 35-year-old spokesperson for the opposition Democratic Party found herself facing down soldiers at gunpoint. A video of the moment, where she is tugging at the barrel of a soldier's rifle, has since gone viral. \"I wasn't thinking about anything intellectual or rational, I was just like, ‘We have to stop this, if we don't stop this, there's nothing else,’’ she told the BBC. \"To be honest, I was a bit scared at first when I first saw the martial law troops. I thought, ‘Is this something that can happen in 21st century Korea, especially in the National Assembly?\" \"After such a storm last night, it was hard to get back to reality,\" she added, recalling the previous night. \"I felt like I was witnessing the regression of history.\"\n\nAs Ahn was confronting the soldiers, the clock was ticking for opposition lawmakers, who rushed to get into the assembly to block the order. Once that happened, the president would have to withdraw it. But first, MPs and their aides had to get inside. Some crawled through the legs of security forces, others shoved and screamed at armed soldiers; many frantically clambered over fences and walls. Hong Kee-won from the Democratic Party told the BBC that he had to scale a 1.5m (4.9ft)-high fence to enter the building, with the police blocking him even after he had shown them identification that proved he was a lawmaker. Hong said that protesters helped to hoist him over the wall. He had been asleep when Yoon made the announcement - when his wife woke him, he raced to parliament. “Democracy is strong here,” Hong said. “The military needs to listen to us, to the constitution, and not to the president.”\n\nLawmakers had to force their way into the assembly...\n\nAnd vote by barricading themselves inside it\n\nLawmakers who made it into the building huddled together, only slightly calmer than the people outside. Hastily, they barricaded the entrances with whatever they could find: cushioned benches, long tables, sofas. Some tried to push back soldiers who had made their way into the assembly building. By 01:00 local time, National Assembly Speaker Woo Won-sik submitted a resolution requesting martial law to be lifted. With that, less than two hours after Yoon’s shock declaration, 190 lawmakers who gathered, including some from Yoon’s party, voted unanimously to block it.\n\nAfter the vote, opposition leader Lee told reporters that this was \"a decisive opportunity to break the vicious cycle and return to normal society\". By 04:30, Yoon was back on TV, in front of the same blue curtains, saying he would withdraw martial law. But this would only be made official, he said, when he could assemble enough of his cabinet to lift the order. The announcement was met with cheers outside the assembly. In the hours before dawn, more people emerged from the building, from behind the barricades they had haphazardly put together. With holes in the doors and broken windows, the stately building already bears scars of the night when South Koreans saved their democracy. Schools, local businesses and banks opened as usual on Wednesday morning - and flights continued to land uninterrupted in South Korea's buzzing capital. But public anger - and the political fallout - was not spent. As the sun rose on Wednesday, thousands gathered to call for Yoon's resignation. The president is also facing impeachment proceedings. “We are a strong democracy…But Korean people want to be safe - President Yoon must resign or be impeached,” Yang Bu-nam, a Democratic Party politician, told the BBC."}

Suspect in German market attack appears in court as anger grows over security lapses\n\nMagdeburg's Christmas market is a sad sight. This should have been the busiest weekend of the season, but the whole area has been cordoned off and all the stands are shut. Police are the only people walking around the boarded-up mulled wine and gingerbread stalls. On the pavement, red candles flicker, tributes laid for the victims. Lukas, a truck driver, told me he felt compelled to come to pay his respects. \"I wasn't there when it happened,\" he told me. \"But I work here in Magdeburg. I'm here every day. I've driven by here a thousand times.\" \"It's a tragedy for everyone here in Magdeburg. The perpetrator should be punished.\" \"We can only hope that th", "continuation": "e victims and their families find the strength to deal with it.\"\n\nThere is sorrow here – but there is anger too. Many people here see this attack as a terrible lapse in security. That is a claim the authorities reject, although they have admitted the attacker entered the market using a route planned for emergency responders. Michael, who also came to pay tributes to the victims, said \"there should've been better security\". \"We should have been prepared better but that was not done properly.\"\n• None Explained: What we know so far about Magdeburg Christmas market attack\n• None From the scene: Eyewitness heard rumbling and shattering glass Standing at the security cordon, I heard a group of locals complaining loudly about Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz and regional politicians. \"They are wasting our tax money, they are just looking out for themselves. They are not interested in us. We just hear empty promises,\" one man said. \"They are turning what happened here around and want to put the blame on the opposition and use it for their election campaign,\" he said. On Saturday evening, around the same time as the square in front of Magdeburg's Gothic cathedral was filled with mourners watching a memorial service, a demonstration took place nearby. Protesters held a banner that read \"Remigration now!\" – a concept popular among the far-right – and shouted \"those who do not love Germany should leave Germany\".\n\nIt is not clear yet what impact this attack may have on Germany's upcoming election. Germany has been hit by a number of deadly Islamist attacks in the past, but investigators said the evidence they have gathered so far suggests a different picture in this case. Germany's Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the suspect appears to have been \"Islamophobic\". The suspect, Taleb Al-Abdulmohsen, is from Saudi Arabia, and his social media posts suggest he had been critical of Islam. He also expressed sympathy on social media for Germany's far-right political party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), re-tweeting posts from the party's leader and a far-right activist."}
{"context": "Protesters gathered outside the presidential palace and police headquarters after the two MPs were detained\n\nPolish police have arrested the former interior minister and deputy interior minister inside the presidential palace in Warsaw in a day of unprecedented political theatre.\n\nMariusz Kaminski and Maciej Wasik were sentenced to two years' jail last month for abuse of power when they led an anti-corruption office in 2007.\n\nFollowing the arrests, the new interior minister Marcin Kierwinski wrote on X: \"Everyone is equal before the law.\"\n\nThe arrests highlight the political turmoil between the Law and Justice (PiS) party and the new pro-EU coalition.\n\nThe men, who were elected PiS MPs in October, refused to recognise last month's court decision because President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, pardoned them for the crime in 2015. Mr Duda has also said he does not recognise the court's ruling because he insists his pardon remains valid.\n\nThe Polish president said in a televised address on Wednesday that he was deeply shaken by the two men being jailed, and described them as honest.\n\nThe two MPs have been stripped of their parliamentary mandates, but both they and President Duda insist they remain legally elected MPs because of the pardon.\n\nOn Monday evening, the court issued a warrant to police to detain the men. Despite this, Mr Duda invited both to Warsaw's Presidential Palace on Tuesday morning to attend a ceremony to swear in two of their former colleagues as presidential advisers.\n\nSeveral hours later, they emerged from the palace to speak briefly to reporters, all the while remaining inside its grounds. Mr Kaminski said they will be \"political prisoners\" if they are arrested and thanked Mr Duda for his support.\n\n\"We are dealing with a very serious state crisis. A grim dictatorship is being created,\" Mr Kaminski said. They then returned inside the palace as the political theatre unfolded.\n\nMoments later, Prime Minister Donald Tusk told a news conference the situation was \"unbelievable\". He said the court's ruling must be respected and suggested President Duda was he", "continuation": "lping the men evade justice.\n\n\"There is no rulebook for the prime minister or interior minister on how to act when convicts are in the Presidential Palace. This is clearly taking advantage of a situation in which no one will use force against such an institution as the president,\" he added.\n\nFollowing the arrests, several hundred PiS supporters demonstrated outside the palace in support of the men.\n\nProtesters moved from the palace to police headquarters when the two MPs were taken into custody\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Mariusz Kaminski announced he was going on hunger strike, \"as a political prisoner, from the first day of my imprisonment\". Hunger strikes are not an uncommon form of protest in Poland, and they do not necessarily mean a refusal to accept all food and liquids.\n\nThe deputy justice minister stressed that neither of the men was a political prisoner but any prisoner had the right to refuse food or drink if they wished.\n\nLast year, the Polish Supreme Court ruled Mr Duda's 2015 pardon was invalid because it was issued while the men were appealing against their conviction, ie before the original conviction was final. Mr Duda disputes that and insists the pardon is still binding.\n\nTo complicate matters, the Constitutional Tribunal and a new Supreme Court chamber, both of which are staffed by judges nominated by PiS, have ruled in favour of Mr Duda.\n\nMr Tusk said Mr Duda could resolve the stand-off by pardoning the men again, now that the ruling is final. But that would call into question the legal status of the initial pardon.\n\nMr Tusk's coalition took office last month pledging to undo PiS's changes to the judiciary, public media, and civil service that the European Commission and many other international bodies say have undermined the rule of law in Poland.\n\nOne of its first acts was to reform the state TV, radio and news agency that PiS had transformed into a propaganda mouthpiece for its government.\n\nBut its methods were similar to PiS's, first using a government minister to sack media boards and install new people ahead of planned legislative reform.\n\nThe Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights acknowledged PiS had made it legally difficult to reform the public media, which it said required \"urgent reform\" because it had become \"a propaganda mouthpiece\" under PiS, but said the new government's changes \"raise serious doubts\".\n\nFormer PiS prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki told the BBC Mr Tusk's government talked loudly about democratic standards but fell well short in practice.\n\n\"We are witnessing an unprecedented attack on the rule of law. Tusk's government decided it could take over public television and media by force. This has nothing to do with democratic standards. We have not seen such brutal government action since communism. It is all the more outrageous that this is done by people who have such slogans of democracy on their lips,\" Mr Morawiecki said.\n\nGiven PiS's record of controlling state institutions while in office, many Tusk supporters argue such accusations are the height of hypocrisy."}
{"context": "Keely Hodgkinson is the fourth successive woman to win BBC Sports Personality of the Year\n\nKeely Hodgkinson says she feels \"pretty close\" to breaking the 800m world record after the Olympic champion capped a memorable 2024 by being named BBC Sports Personality of the Year. Hodgkinson ended her wait for a global title at Paris 2024 to become Team GB's first Olympic champion on the track since Sir Mo Farah's 5,000m and 10,000m double at Rio 2016. The 22-year-old also retained her European title in Rome and improved her British women's record to one minute 54.61 seconds - a time bettered by only five athletes in history. Her coaches Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows, who shared the Coach of the Year award, said they would target both world indoor and outdoor golds next year before chasing the sport's longest-standing record in 2026. It has been 41 years since Czech athlete Jarmila Kratochvilova ran 1:53.28 in 1983, while Hodgkinson will also target Jolanda Ceplak's world indoor mark of 1:55.82 at an event named the 'Keely Klassic' in Birmingham in February. \"I'm not afraid to put my goals out there,\" said Hodgkinson, who won the Sports Personality of the Year public vote ahead of darts star Luke Littler and cricketer Joe Root. \"I'm pretty close [to the world record], I would like to think. I have seen this year what my body is capable of and I'm excited to push on. \"That world record is something I will always have in the back of my head. But I have so many years to get stronger so I'm looking forward to seeing what happens. \"I trust in Trevor and Jenny a lot. I know what shape I'm in before I step on the start line. It all depends if it comes together and that can depend on many things in athletics.\"\n\nHodgkinson had finished second at successive World Championships after claiming a stunning silver on her Olympic debut as a teenager in Tokyo three years ago. But, having vowed to never settle for second on such a stage again after losing out to Kenya's Mary Moraa in Budapest in 2023, in Paris she became only the 10th British woman to win athletics gold at a Games. Meadows, a world 800m bronze medallist and herself coached by husband Painter, said: \"Keely is an incredible athlete and I know that it's still the beginning for her. \"She has huge ambitions in the sport and she wont stop until she's ", "continuation": "at least won another one in LA and even beyond that. \"It's really exciting we now feel like we know how to get those records indoor and outdoor. \"For 2025,the big aim is to win the world indoors and world outdoors. Get the two global titles, that is the big aim. \"Then we think 2026 is the right time to go for the outdoor record. Physically we know she can run 1.53 something in 2025 and then we will push on from there.\"\n\nKeely Hodgkinson went unbeaten in nine races over 800m in 2024\n\nIn another stellar season Hodgkinson went unbeaten over two laps and battled through illness to retain her European title, which in 2022 represented her first major outdoor title. Her improved British record at the London Diamond League in July was not only confirmation that she was ready to make the next step on the podium in Paris, but it has also brought Kratochvilova's as yet untouched record firmly within reach. Painter said: \"We are always going to push those boundaries and try to get the world records, whether indoor or out. \"Whether it happens in 2025 we will have to wait and see, but we will do our best to get it.\" After a minor hamstring injury ended her 2024 season before she could defend her Diamond League title, Hodgkinson returned to training in South Africa in recent weeks. But having admitted that she struggled mentally following the unfamiliar high of her breakout first Games at Tokyo, she is unwavering in her determination as she prepares to chase more history and - in her own words - become one of Britain's greatest ever athletes. The World Indoor Championships take place in Nanjing, China, in March, while outdoor gold is on the line in Tokyo in September. Before then, Hodgkinson will hope to break the world indoor record - set by Ceplak on the day the Briton was born - at her own event at Birmingham's Utilita Arena on 15 February. \"I think this year I have found a real joy in competing,\" said Hodgkinson. \"I just loved London [Diamond League] so much, I loved Prefontaine [Classic], I loved Paris. \"I have loved being in front of a crowd, putting on a performance, having people behind me and winning for them. \"So I am just looking forward to continuing in that way.\""}

{"context": "Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz has quit the emergency government in a sign of deepening divisions over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's post-conflict plans for Gaza. Speaking during a news conference in Tel Aviv on Sunday where he announced his resignation, Mr Gantz said the decision was made with a \"heavy heart\". \"Unfortunately, Mr Netanyahu is preventing us from approaching true victory, which is the justification for the painful ongoing crisis,\" he said. Considered by some to be a potential challenger for power in Israel, Mr Gantz called on Mr Netanyahu to set a date for elections. Mr Netanyahu responded with a post on X: “Benny, this is not the time to quit the campaign, this is the time to join forces.\" Mr Gantz is a political rival of Mr Netanyahu and a former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). His centrist National Unity party was in opposition until 11 October 2023 when, after the start of the war following Hamas's 7 October attacks, he agreed to form an emergency government with Mr Netanyahu. National Unity holds five posts in the emergency government. Current opposition leader Yair Lapid backed Mr Gantz's decision as “important and right” on social media. Immediately after the announcement, far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir demanded a place in the war cabinet. Mr Ben-Gvir is part of a right-wing coalition that has threatened to quit and collapse the government if Israel accepts a ceasefire proposal put forward by US President Joe Biden. Mr Gantz's influence in the government was widely seen as a counterbalance to that of far-right members of Mr Netanyahu’s coalition. Last month, Mr Gantz set a deadline of 8 June for Mr Netanyahu to lay out how Israel would achieve its six \"strategic goals\", including the end of Hamas rule in Gaza and the establishment of a multinational civilian administration for the territory. The prime minister dismissed the comments at the time as \"washed-up words\" that would mean \"defeat for Israel\". A retired army general and frequent critic of Mr Netayanhu, Mr Gantz had been a member of Israel's key decision-making \"war cabinet\", along with the prime minister and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\nDuring the news conference, Mr Gantz said he was not only personally resigning from the government, but also withdrawing from the National Unity party that he chairs. The move will not topple the Israeli government, since Mr Netanyahu will still hold a majority with 64 seats in the 120-seat Knesset. It does, however, further isolate the prime minister and lay bare the deep political divisions over how he is running the war. The resignation also comes one day before US Secretary of State Antony Blinken makes a three-day trip to the region, where he plans to visit Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Qatar to press for a ceasefire agreement.

{"context": "Gaetz paid 'tens of thousands' for sex and drugs, ethics report says\n\nFormer Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz spent tens of thousands of dollars on sex and drugs while serving as a US congressman, according to a long-awaited report from the House of Representatives ethics committee. It follows a years-long investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use by Gaetz, who President-elect Donald Trump wanted to serve as the nation's top lawman. The committee also found evidence that Gaetz, 42, received gifts in excess of permissible amounts in connection to a 2018 trip to the Bahamas. The former lawmaker has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, saying he is the victim of a smear campaign. Amid the controversy, he withdrew from consideration to serve as US attorney general.\n\nThe congressional ethics report found that \"there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favours or privileges, and obstruction of Congress.\" From 2017 to 2020, Gaetz made payments totalling more than $90,000 (£72,000) to 12 different women \"that the Committee determined were likely in connection with sexual activity and/or drug use\", the report found. Additionally, the report contains testimony that Gaetz paid for sex with a 17-year-old at a party in 2017, giving her $400 \"which she understood to be payment for sex\". Gaetz has denied having sex with a minor. The Department of Justice also investigated an allegation that he had sex with a minor but ultimately did not file any criminal charges against him. In a last-minute court filing on Monday, Gaetz sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the report's release. He accused the ethics committee of trying to exercise its jurisdiction over a private citizen. The committee's 42-page report accuses Gaetz of being \"uncooperative\" throughout its review, and that he would frequently \"deflect, deter, or mislead\" the panel \"in order to prevent his actions from being exposed\". Despite a subpoena, he never appeared before the committee to testify. Gaetz represented Florida's first congressional district in the US House of Representatives, having come to power in the same election in 2016 that propelled his ally Trump to the White House the first time. Gaetz got married in 2021 to his current wife, Ginger, who has supported the former Florida congressman as he's faced the allegations. She posted a photo on X of her husband with the caption \"unemployment has never looked so good\" after he withdrew his name to serve as attorney general after resigning from Congress. Gaetz was believed to be beyond the reach of the committee when he resigned from Congress last month, following his nomination by Trump to serve as US attorney general - America's top law enforcement official who heads the Department of Justice. Trump picked Gaetz in part because he is an ultra-loyalist who had also pledged to take on the \"weaponised\" legal system that supporters believe targeted Trump. He has been one of Trump's most strident defenders on Capitol Hill. But many Republicans in Congress, including those tasked with voting on such nominations, were aghast at the choice and successfully challenged it. Gaetz dropped out just eight days after being nominated by Trump amid a groundswell of controversy. Trump then tapped former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi as his nominee for attorney general. Trump has not yet commented on the report's findings.\n\nWhile it is unusual for the committee to release its findings after a lawmaker leaves public office, the report noted that a \"majority\" of members found it was in the public interest to do so in this instance. An intense debate had erupted over whether or not the report should be released, particularly after Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration for the top justice department role. He said that he hoped to avoid a \"needlessly protracted Washington scuffle\". Gaetz's slated role as attorney general was one of those that required the confirmation of US senators, and it did not seem that he had the required support. The secretive ethics committee had investigated Gaetz on and off since 2021 - not only on the claims about sex and drugs, but also on allegations he accepted bribes and misused campaign funds. In all cases, he strongly denied any wrongdoing. House Republicans previously blocke", "continuation": "d Democratic efforts to unveil the results of the report, but two of them later voted to do so, according to CBS. On Monday, Gaetz posted on X that the committee chose to release the report close to Christmas \"and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses\". Last week, he posted that the ethics committee planed to \"post a report online that I have no opportunity to debate or rebut as a former member of the body.\" He acknowledged in a previous post on X that his 30s was an era of \"working very hard - and playing hard too\". \"It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life,\" he wrote. \"I live a different life now.\" Several House Democrats criticised their former colleague and Trump for having chosen him as an ally. Rep Glenn Ivey, one of the five Democrats on the ethics committee, said the allegations against Gaetz show there's a pattern by Trump of not \"putting people in those positions who are really up to doing the job\". \"President-elect Trump should have thought twice before he nominated Matt Gaetz and some of the other nominations he's made, I think would bear reconsideration as well,\" he told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Since leaving Congress, Gaetz has signed a deal to become an anchor on One America News Network (OAN). He'll join the conservative news network in January. He has also started selling personalised video messages on the video platform Cameo.\n• None Four revelations from the House ethics report on Matt Gaetz"}

Hussam Kassas fled Syria in 2016 after he and his family were \"personally targeted\" by Bashar al-Assad's regime due to his work documenting human rights abuses and participating in protests. The father-of-two said he expected his family to be granted refugee status, but the UK's pause on claims had left him uncertain and at risk of losing his home and work. The Home Office has said the move was made \"whilst we assess the current situation\" after the rapid fall of the regime.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2021, more than 30,000 Syrians were granted asylum in the UK - but on Monday the Home Office said it was no longer possible to assess outstanding cases given the change in circumstances there. It means the government has not determined whether Syria, under the new rebel-led authorities, is a safe country which people could be sent to. It has stressed people will not be sent to Syria while the process is ongoing. Mr Kassas is among the 6,500 people the Home Office has said will be impacted by the pause - and who the Refugee Council warned could be \"stuck for months\" with their status in limbo.\n\nThe 36-year-old, who lives in Greater Manchester and is an investigator with the UK-based Syrian British Consortium advocacy group, said his student visa expires next month - leaving him unable to work and rent. \"All of those people who came from Syria need to be supported, need to be empowered, to overcome what happened to them during the last 14 years, not uncertain again, not feeling unsafe again.\" Mr Kassas fled from Syria to Jordan in 2016 before moving to Turkey with his wife and child. He was granted a student visa in the UK in August 2023 and applied for asylum a few weeks later. Speaking about his experiences during Syria's civil war, he said: \"I have been injured in my family house, my family house has been destroyed by barrel bombs and mortar shells. \"At one event they beat my father until he was out of [consciousness] to deliver me to them.\"\n\nMr Kassas said he was \"certain\" he and his family would be \"threatened\" if they returned to Syria, voicing concerns that deposed president Assad's supporters and forces are still present in the country. \"I don't like being a refugee, I have a homeland, I have a right to get back there. But under the circumstances I do not believe I will be able to go. I will not risk my children's safety, I will not risk my wife's,\" he told BBC News.

Earlier this week, cabinet minister Pat McFadden said the UK could remove HTS from the list of banned terrorist groups - but Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer later said it was \"far too early\" to consider a change of policy. BBC News also spoke to Hamid, not his real name, who fled the Assad regime in 2013, after he supported humanitarian work in the country. After moving to Lebanon and Turkey, he arrived in the UK as a student and applied for asylum in late 2023. The father-of-two, who lives in the West Midlands, said the pause to asylum claims had left him \"anxious\" and his wife in tears. \"Currently with their decision, they're affecting thousands of people who are already struggling. [Syrian asylum seekers] cannot go back yet because it's not yet safe, they cannot settle here at the same time, they will be nowhere for an unknown period of time.\"\n\nHamid urged the government to continue making asylum decisions until they can make a better assessment of the safety of Syria for asylum seekers. \"I want to ask them to use logic. After 13 years of a very complicated war, we cannot say in one day that we need to reassess. \"I was really happy for the fall of the Assad regime.

There are crucial legal appeals that are yet to be settled too, including one on whether he is immune from prosecution.\n\nHere, we'll focus on the four criminal cases Mr Trump is facing and explain what they're about, what could happen next and, crucially, what's at stake as he seeks to return to the White House.\n\nA payment made to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election.\n\nMs Daniels says she was paid $130,000 (£103,000) to stay quiet after having sex with Mr Trump, who denies they ever had an affair.\n\nIt's worth noting, though, that providing so-called hush money is not actually illegal.\n\nInstead, this case is more technical and centres on how Mr Trump's former lawyer, who paid Ms Daniels, had his reimbursement recorded in Mr Trump's accounts.\n\nThe former president is accused of falsifying his business records by saying the payment was for legal fees. He's facing 34 counts of fraud under campaign finance laws, and has pleaded not guilty to all of them.\n\nMr Trump has said the case is politically motivated. \"This is just a way of hurting me in the election,\" he told reporters. \"This is not a crime.\"\n\nIt's scheduled for 25 March, when jury selection will get under way.\n\nIt will be the first criminal trial of a US president.\n\nWhat could the punishment be?\n\nEach of the charges carries a maximum of four years in prison, although a judge could sentence Mr Trump to probation if he is convicted.\n\nLegal experts told the BBC they think it is unlikely Mr Trump will be jailed if convicted in this case and that a fine is the more likely outcome.\n\nWhether Mr Trump illegally conspired to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Joe Biden.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege he pressured officials to reverse the results, knowingly spread lies about election fraud and sought to exploit the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021 to delay the certification of Mr Biden's victory and stay in power.\n\nHe's been charged with four criminal counts, including conspiracy to defraud the US and conspiracy against the rights of citizens.\n\nSome had speculated he would be charged with insurrection, or aiding insurrection, but that is not one of the charges.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Mr Trump has pleaded not guilty on all counts.\n\nIt is scheduled for May, but now looks likely to take place after November's election.\n\nIt could be formally delayed by the judge at a scheduling conference on 1 March.\n\nWhat could the punishment be?\n\nThese charges could, in theory, lead to substantial prison time if Mr Trump is convicted.\n\nLooking at the letter of the law, the counts under the Espionage Act each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years.

It is a celebration of Dave's life. \"That's why we're here, because he was so irritatingly positive all of the time. And we love him and that's why we're here.\" Before the event, Mrs Myers said: \"We have people coming from all over the country. We have people coming from Texas, from Malaysia, from all over Europe. \"Oh, it's endearing.

{"context": "Starmer: Reassurance wi", "continuation": "th just a hint of paranoia\n\nI last stood in the airy atrium of One Angel Square, the headquarters of the Co-operative Group in Manchester, a year last February. It’s a snazzy modern tower, steeped in the Labour movement’s particular history here in the north west of England. The Rochdale Pioneers were the first successful co-op, founded in the 1840s to help the poor of that town just up the road from here. And the Co-operative Party is the political sister of the Labour Party. Sir Keir Starmer chose this backdrop last year to set out the first building blocks of Labour’s programme for government, what he calls his “missions”. Now the party has pointedly circled back here to complete, or so they hope, that political construction. Labour seek to be paragons of predictability: bells, whistles, rabbits and hats are well and truly out of fashion. When manifestos are published, it is always worth thinking about what the party in question hopes will be the controlling thought of the tome they are handing out. For the Conservatives at Silverstone in Northamptonshire the other day, the controlling thought was tax cuts. Here in Manchester with Labour, the controlling thought was reassurance.\n\nSo, Labour folk have been going out of their way to make a virtue out of the lack of surprises. The 133 page, 23,000 word manifesto, external does not contain any policy that had not been announced already. Solid stability is not necessarily rocket fuel for the soul of those seeking a party to enthuse about, rather than plump for on polling day. It has led Labour’s critics to say the party is being vague, even boring. But Sir Keir reckons people are fed up of fireworks and political circus. He wants to make the boring interesting again, or at least appealing compared to its alternative. This reflects his character, his seriousness of purpose, his disdain for politics’ penchant for theatricality. But it is also a caution borne of an almighty opinion poll lead and a judgement that promising the moon on a stick isn’t affordable nor believable. Whatever the analysis of this prospectus, and the steady arc of its assembly, beginning in this building and heading back to it, there is one remarkable fact worth reflecting on. Labour was a party in dire straits five years ago and yet is now possessed of a discipline, focus and determination it hasn’t had in nearly two decades. This can, on occasion, tilt towards an attention to detail that borders on absurd paranoia.\n\nWhen I was invited on to the Labour battlebus to interview Keir Starmer, the whole thing was held up by fretting aides worrying that the \"emergency exit\" sticker on the window next to us would amount to an embarrassing gaffe. You might remember there was a splash of fuss earlier in the campaign when Rishi Sunak was photographed near an \"exit\" sign on a plane. And so, on the Labour bus, began a comprehensive debate among press officers about whether we would all have to move to another seat or whether some gaffer tape could be stuck over the offending sign. In the end, said tape was applied, until it was concluded that it drew even more attention to what they were trying to hide, and so it was taken down. Maddening for the reporter on a deadline – me. But a rather daft illustration of a bigger point: this is a party with an attention to detail which means nothing is being left to chance. Even the gaffer tape. And three weeks out from the general election, Labour is the runaway favourite to break the habit of its lifetime, and actually win."}

{"context": "After showing little movement in the first two weeks of the campaign, the opinion polls are now showing some clear shifts. In seven polls conducted so far this week, support for the Conservatives stands on average at just 20% - that’s four points down on where they were at the beginning of the election campaign. However, support for Labour has also fallen. They are averaging 41% in this week’s polls, three points down over the course of the campaign. But, because both parties are down by similar amounts, Labour still enjoy a lead of 20 points or so. So who has been gaining support? One party that undoubtedly has done so is Reform UK. On average they are at 16% in this week’s polls – five points up on where they were when the election was called. True, so far there have been rather more polls this week from companies that have tended to record relatively high figures for Reform, but they are probably at least on 15%.\n\nOne poll in particular has caught people’s attention. A YouGov survey of more than 2,200 adults, external, conducted between 12 and 13 June, puts Reform at one point ahead of the Tories for the first time on 19%. However, this is just one poll. We have had four others published in the last 24 hours, none of which have had Reform ahead and not even all of which had the party gaining ground. On average, Reform is still four or five points behind the Conservatives. But this is still bad news for the Tories.\n\nThe only way that Rishi Sunak could hope to even get to base camp in narrowing Labour’s large poll lead was to squeeze the Reform vote, virtually all of which is coming from those who voted Conservative in 2019. In 2019, Reform’s predecessor, the Brexit Party, did not stand in Conservative-held constituencies, This time, Reform are standing virtually everywhere in England, Scotland and Wales. This means Reform is likely to take most votes away from the Conservatives in seats that Rishi Sunak’s party is trying to defend. Rather than the Tories making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least, of course, because of Nigel Farage’s decision to fight this campaign. The former UKIP and Brexit Party leader previously said he would not stand in the election but on 3 June announced he would be Reform’s candidate in Clacton, as well as take over as the party’s leader.

Leader of the Scottish National Party John Swinney said Labour would \"continue with spending cuts where the Tories left off\". The Green Party expressed similar concerns, with the party's co-leader Carla Denyer saying the party's \"refusal to increase taxes on the super-rich means they will be forced to resort to more public spending cuts\".

Referencing the former leader of his own party, Sir Keir said the Tories had drawn up a document that would \"load everything into the wheelbarrow\" without explaining how to pay for it. Sir Keir served in Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet but defended his criticism saying: \"If you lose that badly, you don't look at the electorate... you look at your party and say 'You need to change'.\" The Labour leader's comments came ahead of Rishi Sunak launching his manifesto at the Silverstone race track in Northamptonshire. Mr Sunak said his manifesto showed that \"our economy has truly turned a corner\" and that his party's policies would ensure \"more British success stories\". He said the measures were \"fully funded and would result in lower borrowing in 2029-30\". “Do not forget that Keir Starmer is asking you to hand him a blank cheque when he hasn’t said what he’ll buy with it and how much it is going to cost you,\" he added.\n\nMr Sunak's pledges include a new Help to Buy scheme to support first time buyers to purchase a home and a 2p cut in employee National Insurance. Asked if he would match the Conservatives' National Insurance tax cut, Sir Keir said the \"money's not there\".

At the time Sir Keir, who was then the shadow Brexit secretary, praised the manifesto saying it offered \"real change\" and \"an ambition to meet the needs\" of the country. When he ran for the Labour leadership in 2020, he also said he would not \"trash\" the record of Mr Corbyn. Asked on Tuesday why he was now attacking a manifesto he previously supported, Sir Keir said it was Labour's defeat in the 2019 election that persuaded him to \"change\" the party. Mr Corbyn has previously said Sir Keir should not \"diss the past or diss his involvement in it\". Responding to Sir Keir's criticism of Mr Corbyn, the left-wing campaign group Momentum said: \"Labour's 2019 manifesto was fully costed - Keir should know, he stood on it as a member of the shadow cabinet. \"How about stopping attacking your own side during an election?\" As well as comparing Mr Sunak to Jeremy Corbyn, Sir Keir also accused the prime minister of pursuing a similar approach to his predecessor Liz Truss. He warned that “unfunded” commitments could crash the economy and that “if you lose control of the economy it’s working people who pay the price.” Reacting to the manifesto, Paul Johnson, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies public spending think tank, said, external he had a \"degree of scepticism\" over the \"uncertain, unspecific and apparently victimless savings\" that would pay for tax cuts. He also said the party \"remained silent\" on where public spending cuts, implied by the Budget in March, would fall. Earlier this year, the think tank accused both Labour and the Conservatives of a \"conspiracy of silence\" over the spending cuts or tax rises that would need to be made following the next election.\n\nThe SNP's Drew Hendry said: “The Tories really should have spared themselves the bother of producing a manifesto plan because we all know the public plan is to boot them out of office in a matter of weeks. \"People deserve to know whether the Labour Party will simply carry on where the Tories left off when it comes to cuts to our public services.\" The Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the Conservative manifesto was not \"worth the paper it's printed on\". \"No one will believe anything they're promising today,\" she said.

A UK-based war monitor reports that the \"local factions\" were able to take control of many military sites there following \"violent battles\" with government forces. According to Reuters news agency, rebel sources say they had reached a deal for the army to withdraw and for military officials to be given safe passage to the capital, Damascus - roughly 100km (62 miles) away. Meanwhile in the north, Syria's military says it is carrying out air strikes around Homs, trying to push back rebels who've reached the edges of the strategic city.\n\nReports from a war monitor indicate Syrian forces have withdrawn to towns just 10km (6.2 miles) from Damascus, although this has been denied by the army and the BBC has been unable to verify it. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based war monitor, said on Friday that the rebels in the south controlled more than 90% of the Deraa region and that only the Sanamayn area was still in government hands. Deraa city has both strategic and symbolic importance. It is a provincial capital and is close to the main crossings on the Jordanian border, while also being where pro-democracy protests erupted in 2011 - sparking the country's ongoing civil war, in which more than half a million people have been killed. Jordan's interior minister said the country had closed its side of the border as \"a result of the surrounding security conditions in Syria's south\". Along with the US and UK, Jordan has also urged its citizens to leave Syria as soon as possible. Meanwhile, government officials in the city of Suweida - about 50km east of Deraa - are reported to have fled the city following clashes between security forces and militias from the minority Druze sect, which is predominant in the region. Ryan Marouf, an activist and editor of news website Suwayda 24, told Reuters that \"people are seeing what is happening in the rest of Syria as liberation of Syria and a chance to bring down the regime\". Elsewhere, Kurdish-led forces say they have taken the city of Deir Ezzor, the government's main foothold in the vast desert in east of the country. And in the north, the main rebel offensive has reached the outskirts of the strategic city of Homs. The Syrian military and its Russian allies are fighting back, with air strikes killing 20 civilians in the city's suburbs on Friday. And crucially, officials quoted in the New York Times say President Assad's other key ally, Iran, has begun to evacuate its military commanders and personnel.\n• None What is happening in north-western Syria and why now?\n• None Syria in maps: Where have anti-Assad rebels taken control?\n• None Who are the anti-Assad rebels? It has been just over a week since rebels in the north launched their lightning offensive - the biggest against the Syrian government in years, which has exposed the weakness of the country's military. At least 370,000 people are thought to have been displaced so far as a result of the rebel offensive, according to the UN, which has said the fighting is also \"worsening an already horrific situation for civilians in the north of the country\". Some civilians are trapped in front-line areas ", "continuation": "unable to reach safer locations. SOHR says more than 820 people, including 111 civilians, have been killed across the country since the Islamist-led rebels began their offensive last week. They seized Hama, to the north of Homs, on Thursday - a second major blow to President Assad, who lost control of Aleppo last week. The leader of the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, told residents of Homs \"your time has come\". The rebels have been advancing south, and Homs would be the next stop on the road to the Damascus.\n\nTerrified members of President Assad's Alawite minority community are rushing to leave Homs, with video footage showing roads jammed with cars. \"Our forces have liberated the last village on the outskirts of the city of Homs and are now on its walls,\" the Syrian faction leading the assault said on Telegram. The BBC has not been able to verify these movements, but SOHR earlier reported that rebels were within a few kilometres of the city. The SOHR said Russian warplanes had bombed a bridge in nearby Rastan to try and slow the rebel advance. After the Syrian military lost control of Hama following days of fighting, it is not clear whether it will be able to defend Homs. The defence ministry has denied claims it had withdrawn troops from the strategic city, which links the capital Damascus to the Alawite heartland on the Mediterranean coast. The Alawites are a minority sect of Shia Muslims from which the Assad family originates. They have long formed a major support base for Assad rule, and are key to the president's grip on power. Assad has vowed to \"crush\" the rebels and accused Western powers of trying to redraw the map of the region. But analysts say his forces are demoralised, dealing with low pay and corruption in the ranks. He announced a 50% pay rise in recent days, according to state news agency Sana. Russia and Iran, the regime's most important allies, have declared continued support for Assad. But they have not provided the kind of military assistance that so far has been propping up his rule, and Moscow is now urging Russian nationals to leave the country. The US on Friday also advised its citizens to leave Syria \"while commercial options remain available in Damascus\".\n\nIslamist-led Syrian rebels declared victory in Hama on Thursday as the country's military withdrew from a second major city\n\nThe Kremlin is preoccupied with its war in Ukraine, and Iran has been weakened by Israel's punishing campaign against its most powerful allied militia, Lebanon's Hezbollah. Hezbollah, whose fighters had been key to holding regime territory in Syria, are now largely absent from the battlefield, although reports in the Lebanese and Israeli press say small numbers have crossed the border to shore up Homs' defence. Russian and Iranian officials are expected to meet with their Turkish counterparts at the weekend to discuss a response to this upsurge in Syria's civil war. Turkey backs some of the rebel groups and its president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has for months pressed Mr Assad to reach a political solution with the opposition. He has voiced support for the rebels' recent advances, and said the offensive would not have happened if Assad had responded to his calls. Analysts say it almost certainly could not have happened without Ankara's knowledge and approval. For his part, the leader of HTS, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has been making public remarks to soften his image and reassure both Syrians and foreign leaders. He has emphasized his split years ago from Islamic State and Al Qaeda, presenting himself as a nationalist opposed to attacks outside Syria, and promising protection for minority communities. In an interview with CNN, al-Jolani said the goal of the rebel forces was to overthrow the Assad regime and install a government that represents all Syrians.\n• None Inside Aleppo: Family reunions, nervousness at rebel rule and fear of war\n\nEarlier, HTS fighters and their allies took over Hama and released inmates from its central prison amid fierce battles, while the military said it had redeployed troops outside the city. Hama is home to one million people and is 110km south of Aleppo, which the rebels captured last week. In Aleppo, a city of two million people, some public services and critical facilities - including hospitals, bakeries, power stations, water, internet and telecommunications - are disrupted or non-functional because of shortages of supplies and personnel.

When asked by an audience member if the West had \"received the message\" on Russia's change to its nuclear doctrine, which Putin pushed through in November, he said \"you'll have to ask them.\" The new nuclear doctrine allows Russia to conduct a nuclear strike on any country, if it is backed by a nuclear power. That means if Ukraine were to launch a large attack on Russia with conventional missiles, drones or aircraft, that could meet the criteria for a nuclear response, as could an attack on Belarus or any critical threat to Russia's sovereignty. Putin also emphasised the capabilities of Russia's new intermediate-range ballistic missile, Oreshnik, which was used in a strike on Ukraine in November. In order to test its power, he suggested Russia should fire the Oreshnik towards Ukraine, and Ukrainian air defence - using US-supplied systems - should try to bring it down. As for the name \"Oreshnik\"? \"Honestly,\" Putin said with a smirk, \"No idea. No clue.\" A dominant theme throughout the event was \"Russian sovereignty\", with Putin claiming that less reliance on international partners - partly a result of Western sanctions - was one of the key achievements of his invasion of Ukraine. He said the economy was \"stable\", pointing to higher growth than countries like Germany, but admitted inflation of 9.1% was \"alarming\". In fact, the economy is overheating and highly reliant on military production - sometimes termed the \"military industrial complex\". Throughout the address, Putin also answered questions on domestic issues - from telephone scammers to young people's struggles with getting a mortgage."}
{"context": "Greek coastguard threw migrants overboard to their deaths, witnesses say\n\nThe Greek coastguard has caused the deaths of dozens of migrants in the Mediterranean over a three-year period, witnesses say, including nine who were deliberately thrown into the water. The nine are among more than 40 people alleged to have died as a result of being forced out of Greek territorial waters, or taken back out to sea after reaching Greek islands, BBC analysis has found. The Greek coastguard told our investigation it strongly rejects all accusations of illegal activities. We showed footage of 12 people being loaded into a Greek coastguard boat, and then abandoned on a dinghy, to a former senior Greek coastguard officer. When he got up from his chair, and with his mic still on, he said it was \"obviously illegal\" and \"an international crime\". The Greek government has long been accused of forced returns - pushing people back towards", "continuation": " Turkey, where they have crossed from, which is illegal under international law. But this is the first time the BBC has calculated the number of incidents which allege that fatalities occurred as a result of the Greek coastguard's actions. The 15 incidents we analysed - dated May 2020-23 - resulted in 43 deaths. The initial sources were primarily local media, NGOs and the Turkish coastguard. Verifying such accounts is extremely difficult - witnesses often disappear, or are too fearful to speak out. But in four of these cases we were able to corroborate accounts by speaking with eye witnesses. Our research, which features in a new BBC documentary, Dead Calm: Killing in the Med?, suggested a clear pattern.\n\nThis man from Cameroon told the BBC he was thrown into the sea by the coastguard - his two companions drowned\n\nIn five of the incidents, migrants said they were thrown directly into the sea by the Greek authorities. In four of those cases they explained how they had landed on Greek islands but were hunted down. In several other incidents, migrants said they had been put onto inflatable rafts without motors which then deflated, or appeared to have been punctured. One of the most chilling accounts was given by a Cameroonian man, who says he was hunted by Greek authorities after landing on the island of Samos in September 2021. Like all the people we interviewed, he said he was planning to register on Greek soil as an asylum seeker. \"We had barely docked, and the police came from behind,\" he told us. \"There were two policemen dressed in black, and three others in civilian clothes. They were masked, you could only see their eyes.\" He and two others - another from Cameroon and a man from Ivory Coast - were transferred to a Greek coastguard boat, he said, where events took a terrifying turn. “They started with the [other] Cameroonian. They threw him in the water. The Ivorian man said: ‘Save me, I don’t want to die'… and then eventually only his hand was above water, and his body was below. \"Slowly his hand slipped under, and the water engulfed him.\" Our interviewee says his abductors beat him. \"Punches were raining down on my head. It was like they were punching an animal.\" And then he says they pushed him, too, into the water - without a life jacket. He was able to swim to shore, but the bodies of the other two - Sidy Keita and Didier Martial Kouamou Nana - were recovered on the Turkish coastline. The survivor’s lawyers are demanding the Greek authorities open a double murder case.\n\nIn June 2023, an overloaded trawler flips in front of a Greek coast guard patrol boat. More than 600 men, women and children die in the water. But who is responsible, and are the coast guard at fault? Watch on iPlayer or on BBC Two at 21:00 on Monday 17 June.\n\nAnother man, from Somalia, told the BBC how in March 2021 he had been caught by the Greek army on arrival on the island of Chios, who then handed him to the Greek coastguard. He said the coastguard had tied his hands behind his back, before dropping him into the water. \"They threw me zip-tied in the middle of the sea. They wanted me to die,\" he said. He said he managed to survive by floating on his back, before one of his hands broke free from the ligature. But the sea was choppy, and three in his group died. Our interviewee made it to land where he was eventually spotted by the Turkish coastguard. Of the incidents we analysed, the one with the highest loss of life was in September 2022. A boat carrying 85 migrants ran into trouble near the Greek island of Rhodes when its motor cut out. Mohamed, from Syria, told us they rang the Greek coastguard for help - who loaded them onto a boat, returned them to Turkish waters and put them in life rafts. Mohamed says the raft he and his family were given had not had its valve properly closed. \"We immediately began to sink, they saw that… They heard us all screaming, and yet they still left us,\" he told the BBC. \"The first child who died was my cousin's son… After that it was one by one. Another child, another child, then my cousin himself disappeared. By the morning seven or eight children had died. \"My kids didn't die until the morning… right before the Turkish coastguard arrived.\"\n\nGreek law allows all migrants seeking asylum to register their claim on several of the islands at special registration centres. But our interviewees - who we contacted with the help of migrant support body Consolidated Rescue Group - said they were apprehended before they could get to these centres. They said these men would be apparently operating undercover - non-uniformed, and often masked. Human rights groups allege thousands of people seeking asylum in Europe have been illegally forced back from Greece to Turkey and denied the right to seek asylum, which is enshrined in international and EU law. Austrian activist Fayad Mulla told us he discovered for himself how secretive such operations seem to be in February last year, on the Greek island of Lesbos. Driving towards the location of an alleged forced return after a tip-off, he was stopped by a man in a hoodie - who was later revealed to work for the police. He said the police then attempted to delete the footage of him being stopped from his dashcam and charge him with resisting a police officer. Ultimately, no further action was taken.\n\nFayad Mulla's dashcam recorded the moment he was stopped by undercover police after he was tipped off about a forced return on Lesbos\n\nTwo months later, in a similar place, Mr Mulla managed to film a forced return, published by The New York Times. A group which included women and babies was unloaded from the back of an unmarked van and marched down a jetty onto a small boat. They were then transferred onto a Greek coastguard vessel further away from the coastline, taken out to sea, and then put onto a raft where they were left to drift. They were later rescued by the Turkish coastguard. We showed this footage - which the BBC has verified - to Dimitris Baltakos, the former head of special operations with the Greek coastguard. During the interview, he refused to speculate about what the footage showed - having denied, earlier in our conversation, that the Greek coastguard would ever be required to do anything illegal. But during a break, he was recorded telling someone out of shot in Greek: \"I haven't told them much, right? It's very clear, isn't it. It's not nuclear physics. I don't know why they did it in broad daylight… It's… obviously illegal. It's an international crime.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'It's obviously illegal' - moment former senior coastguard speaks off camera\n\nGreece's Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy told the BBC the footage is currently being investigated by the country's independent National Transparency Authority. An investigative journalist we spoke to based on the island of Samos says she began chatting with a member of the Greek special forces via the dating app Tinder. When he rang her from what he described as a \"warship\", Romy van Baarsen asked him more about his work - and what happened when his forces spotted a refugee boat. He replied that they \"drive them back\", and said such orders were \"from the minister\", adding they would be punished if they failed to stop a boat. Greece has always denied so-called “pushbacks” are taking place. Greece is an entryway into Europe for many migrants. Last year, there were 263,048 sea arrivals in Europe,, external with Greece receiving 41,561 (16%) of those. Turkey signed a deal with the EU in 2016 to stop migrants and refugees crossing into Greece, but said in 2020 it could no longer enforce it.\n\nJournalist Romy van Baarsen was told by a Greek special forces member that they are under government instruction to drive the boats back\n\nWe put the findings in our investigation to the Greek coastguard. It replied that its staff worked \"tirelessly with the utmost professionalism, a strong sense of responsibility and respect for human life and fundamental rights\", adding that they were \"in full compliance with the country's international obligations\". It added: \"It should be highlighted that from 2015 to 2024, the Hellenic Coast Guard has rescued 250,834 refugees/migrants in 6,161 incidents at sea. The impeccable execution of this noble mission has been positively recognized by the international community.\" The Greek coastguard has previously been criticised for its role in the biggest migrant shipwreck in the Mediterranean for a decade. More than 600 people are feared to have died after the Adriana sank in Greece’s demarcated rescue area last June. Greek officials have insisted the boat was not in trouble and was safely on its way to Italy, and so the coastguard did not attempt a rescue."}

The economic support forms a significant part of a $50bn (£39bn) package agreed by G7 member nations announced in June. Funding the aid through frozen assets means Russia has to \"bear the costs of its illegal war, instead of taxpayers,\" US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. It comes a matter of weeks before US President Joe Biden is replaced by Donald Trump, who has said he wants to end the war in Ukraine quickly upon taking office.\n\nThe president-elect has characterised financial support to Kyiv as a drain on US resources, casting doubt on whether aid will continue under the new administration. The US Treasury said on Tuesday that it had transferred the $20bn to a World Bank fund, where it will be available for Ukraine to draw from. Money handled by the World Bank cannot be used for military purposes. The administration had hoped to dedicate half of the money to military aid, the Reuters news agency reported, but this would have required approval from Congress. There were months of delay, amid political wrangling in the House of Representatives, before $61bn of military aid for Ukraine was approved in April.\n\nThe $20bn will give the country \"a critical infusion of support\" as it defends itself \"against an unprovoked war of aggression,\" Yellen said in a statement on Tuesday. It follows months of discussion among the US and its allies, including the EU, on how to use the approximately $325bn (£276bn) worth of assets that were frozen since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022. In October, the G7 agreed to use the interest generated by the assets – around $3bn (£2.4bn) a year – to fund $50bn in credit over 30 years. Payments were expected to start by the end of the year. The EU has committed more than €18bn (£15bn) funded in the same way. The $50bn is intended to ensure Ukraine has \"the resources it needs to sustain emergency services, hospitals, and other foundations of its brave resistance,\" Yellen said. It comes at a critical juncture for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's forces, who have been ceding territory recently. Moscow has been retaking ground in eastern Ukraine and in Russia's Kursk - which Ukrainian forces launched an offensive in over the summer - while Ukrainian troops have painted a dismal picture of the war's frontlines."}

Streeting told MPs he was making the temporary ban introduced in May indefinite across the UK, following a consultation and advice from the Commission on Human Medicines - calling the way the drugs had been used a \"scandal\". The expert group said prescribing the drugs to children for gender dysphoria was an \"unacceptable safety risk\". Campaigners on both sides have reacted to the news, with those in support of the ban commending Streeting's \"integrity\" and those against calling it \"discrimination\".\n\nPuberty blockers are drugs used to delay or prevent puberty happening. A temporary ban was put in place by the last Conservative government, and had been renewed twice by Streeting.

{"context": "Villagers are fighting against the proposed battery storage facilities\n\nA rural community in the Borders is warning that Scotland's renewable energy revolution is coming at a cost. Residents of Leitholm - a village between Coldstream and Greenlaw - claim the heart is being ripped out of their community with the arrival of battery storage facilities. If all six proposed facilities are approved, more than 200 acres of farmland will be turned over to concreted compounds within a three-kilometre radius of their village. Retired nursery owner Seonaid Blackie said: \"This is not the place it used to be - people are worried sick.\"\n\nSix battery storage facilities - covering the equivalent of 128 football pitches - are planned for sites around Leitholm\n\nScottish Power Energy Networks (SPEN) are currently expanding and creating new electricity substations across central and southern Scotland to cater for the increase in renewable energy being generated, mainly by onshore and offshore windfarms. With the National Grid predicting that the amount of energy storage will need to increase by six times before the end of the decade, bids for new battery compounds are following behind each substation development. The facilities will be required to store excess energy, which will then be released when there is less wind or demand increases.\n\nAs work to double the size of the Eccles substation, close to Leitholm, continues permission has been granted for two battery storage facilities on nearby farmland - with a further four in the pipeline. Eccles Energy Centre Limited, which has submitted plans for a 500MW facility around two kilometres south of Leithholm, says there are significant restrictions to where battery developments can currently be connected to the network. A spokesperson explained: \"Connection capacity currently exists at expanded or newly developed strategic substations in the Scottish Borders and this is why we are working to develop, construct and operate a battery energy storage system in immediate proximity to the Eccles HV substation. \"Our site has also been selected with the view of minimising impact on environment, infrastructure, traffic and local communities, and the development will adhere to all local and national planning, and environmental requirements.\"\n\nRichard Honer moved to Leitholm to recover after suffering horrific injuries in a car crash\n\nRichard Honer relocated to the Berwickshir", "continuation": "e village almost two decades ago after suffering severe injuries in a car crash.

But he feels they should not be at the expense of other environmental concerns. He said: \"We need energy storage - about half of our electricity at the moment is coming from wind. \"To get all of our electricity from renewables we need storage - and batteries are an important part of solving some of the problems that come with this aim. \"But having food production and carbon capture are also very important - there needs to be a balance. \"Industrial brownfield sites should be the place to start when considering battery storage facilities. \"You need controls to make sure you have enough energy storage, but also to make sure that you don't have too much.\"\n\nSeonaid Blackie believes her retirement has been taken away\n\nSeonaid Blackie recently bought her retirement bungalow in the nearby town of Kelso.

They also state that cumulative impacts are also taken into account as part of the decision-making process. The spokesperson added: \"All applications are subject to site specific assessments.\" Scottish Borders Council says that all parties have their opportunity to comment directly on applications which either go before them, if below 50MW, or to the ECU. A spokesman said: \"The council's remit is to assess the planning implications of the proposal - in other words, to assess the proposal against development plan policies and make any technical assessments that it has responsibility for, such as landscape and visual impacts, access, noise and the effect of these on residential amenity.\"\n\nJames Finnie has been advised that the value of his home has reduced by 40 percent\n\nSPEN are currently consulting with two other communities in the Scottish Borders - near Hawick and Lauder - about the creation of two new substations as part of their Cross Border Connection Project. The company said: \"The substation at Eccles is a critical point of the electricity grid and is being extended to install equipment that will facilitate the transfer of power between Scotland and England to meet this increase in demand and renewable generation.\" But resident James Finnie believes one of the proposed battery storage facilities near Eccles substation has put his life in limbo. He explained: \"Both my wife and I have elderly parents in their 80s and 90s - and we decided a couple of years ago to sell up and move closer so that we could take care of them. \"We put our home outside Leitholm on the market, but during the sales process the news came through the grapevine about a battery storage site being planned directly behind our home. \"Since making this known on our sellers' declaration there has been absolutely no interest - our selling agent has advised that there will need to be a 40 percent reduction in the sale price. \"We feel that our lives are now on hold.\"\n\nBob Hope is chair of Leitholm, Eccles and Birgham community council\n\nLeitholm, Eccles and Birgham community council supported the substation extension, as well as the initial two battery storage facilities.

It is understood the standards commissioner’s investigation is on hold while the police inquiry is taking place, and police have spoken to at least one member of Conservative staff.\n\nA lawyer on behalf of Ms Jones said in a statement: \"Ms Jones did not receive any formal bullying complaint in relation to any of her staff members\". They added that she \"is satisfied that any allegations in relation to impropriety surrounding expenses are entirely misconceived\". \"Ms Jones’s belief is that these complaints being lodged with the standards commissioner are without foundation. \"As these matters are the subject of ongoing inquiries, it would be inappropriate for Ms Jones to make any further comment. \"Ms Jones has no issue with the BBC or its sources putting these allegations to the police and/or the standards commissioner, which will provide her the opportunity to respond in a formal manner as part of the inquiry should the authorities require it.\""}

Too much has to be done to clear the area of unexploded ordinance and booby traps, as well as to ensure supporting infrastructure is in place.\n\nMr Blinken also told the press conference that South African claims that Israel was committing genocide, filed at the International Court of Justice, were \"meritless\".\n\nBut he said: \"The daily toll on civilians in Gaza, particularly on children, is far too high.\"\n\nHe cited UN figures that 90% of the population continued to face severe food insecurity, adding: \"For children, the effects of long periods without sufficient food can have lifelong consequences.\"\n\n\"More food, more water, more medicine, other essential goods need to get into Gaza.

{"context": "'High risk' of famine in Gaza persists, new UN-backed report says\n\nThe World Food Programme said the report “paints a stark picture of ongoing hunger” in Gaza\n\nA UN-backed assessment says almost half a million Palestinians across Gaza are still facing “catastrophic levels” of hunger and that a “high risk” of famine persists as long as the Israel-Hamas war continues and humanitarian access is restricted. However, the report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) says the available evidence does not indicate a famine is currently occurring in the north of the Palestinian territory. The previous assessment in March had projected that one was imminent in the area. The amount of food and other aid allowed into the north has increased since then, and nutrition, water, sanitation and health services have been stepped up, the report says. But it warns that food availability in the south and central Gaza has been significantly reduced due to the closure of the Rafah border crossing and the displacement of more than one million people from the city of Rafah since early May, when Israel launched a ground operation there. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said the report “paints a stark picture of ongoing hunger” and showed the critical importance of sustained humanitarian access. UN officials have blamed the situation on Israeli military restrictions on aid deliveries, the ongoing hostilities and the breakdown of law and order. Israel insists there are no limits to the amount of aid that can be delivered into and across Gaza and blames UN agencies for failing to distribute supplies. It also accuses Hamas of stealing aid, which the group denies.

More than 37,650 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nThe IPC - a global initiative by UN agencies, aid groups and governments - is the primary mechanism the international community uses to conclude whether a famine is happening. Households are classified as IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) if they experience an extreme lack of food, starvation and exhaustion of coping strategies. For a famine to be officially declared in a specific area, there must be evidence that at least 20% of households are in Phase 5, 30% of children are suffering from acute malnutrition, and there are two deaths for every 10,000 inhabitants, or four child deaths out of 10,000 children per day, “due to outright starvation or to the interaction of malnutrition and disease”. In March, the IPC classified 677,000 Gazans - or 30% of the 2.2 million population - as being in Phase 5, external, including 165,000 people trapped in northern Gaza. It also projected that a famine was “imminent” in the north by the end of May because of conflict and the near-complete lack of humanitarian access. Israel rejected that analysis, external, questioning the IPC’s transparency, methodology and sources of information. The IPC assessment published on Tuesday, external says more than 495,000 Gazans, including 60,000 in the north, are still facing catastrophic hunger. “In contrast with the assumptions made for the projection period (March – July 2024), the amount of food and non-food commodities allowed into the northern governorates increased,” it says. “Additionally, the response in the nutrition, water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and health sectors was scaled up. In this context, the available evidence does not indicate that famine is currently occurring.” Although an estimated 20% of households in the north are in Phase 5, the thresholds of acute malnutrition and mortality have not been passed, it explains. The World Health Organization said earlier this month that 32 deaths attributed to malnutrition, including 28 among children under five years old, had been reported by local health officials. The IPC report warns that there continues to be “a high and sustained risk of famine across the whole Gaza Strip”, and that the improvement in April and May “should not allow room for complacency”. The WFP said the “slight improvement” seen in the IPC report showed the difference that greater access could make, but stressed that the situation was “still desperate”. “To truly turn the corner and prevent famine, adequate and sustained levels of humanitarian assistance must be provided,” it added. Meanwhile, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) told reporters in Geneva that at least 10 children a day on average were losing one or both of their legs because of the war. Philippe Lazzarini said that figure did not include children who had lost hands or arms, and that the amputations usually took place in what he described as “quite horrible conditions” and sometimes without anaesthetic.\n\nTwo schools in northern Gaza were struck by Israeli aircraft early on Tuesday\n\nIn Gaza, at least 24 people - including the sister of Hamas’s Qatar-based political chief Ismail Haniyeh - were reportedly killed in three Israeli air strikes in northern Gaza early on Tuesday. Health officials told Reuters news agency that 14 people were killed in strikes on two schools used as shelters by displaced people in the central Daraj area of Gaza City and the urban Shati refugee camp, to the north. The Israeli military said in a statement that aircraft had struck “two structures that were being used by Hamas terrorists” in Shati and Daraj. “The terrorists operated inside school compounds that were used by Hamas as a shield for its terrorist activities,” it added, accusing some of them of being involved in holding hostages and taking part in the 7 October attack. Hamas has previously denied using schools for military purposes. The other 10 people were said to have been killed in a pre-dawn strike on a house in Shati. A neighbour and Palestinian media identified those killed as Ismail Haniyeh's sister Zahr and nine members of her family. Mr Haniyeh - who also lost three of his sons and several grandchildren in a strike in April - said the killing of his relatives would not make Hamas change its stance and reaffirmed the group’s demands for a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Th Israeli military has so far not commented on the reports. Médecins Sans Frontières meanwhile expressed outrage at the “horrific and cynical” killing of one of its staff members, external in an attack in Gaza City on Tuesday morning. Physiotherapist Fadi al-Wadiya was killed along with five other people, including three children, as he cycled to the MSF clinic where he worked, the charity said, without blaming any party. The Israeli military later announced that it had killed Fadi al-Wadiya in an air strike, accusing him of being a “significant [Palestinian] Islamic Jihad terrorist” who had developed the group’s rockets array."}
{"context": "Syrian rebels celebrated on the streets of Hama after the Syrian military pulled out\n\nSyrian rebels say they have taken full control of a second major city, after the military withdrew its troops from Hama in another setback for President Bashar al-Assad. The leader of the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, declared \"victory\" in Hama and vowed there would be \"no revenge\". Earlier, HTS fighters and their allies took over Hama central prison and released inmates amid fierce battles, while the military said it had redeployed troops outside the city. Hama is home to one million people and is 110km (70 miles) south of Aleppo, which the rebels captured last week after launching a surprise offensive from their stronghold in the north-west.\n\nA rebel commander told residents of Homs, which is the next city south on the highway from Aleppo to Damascus, that \"your time has come\". In the past, President Assad relied on Russia and Iran to crush his opponents. But with both allies preoccupied with their own affairs, it is unclear how - or if - he will be able to stop an advance that could threaten his government's survival. More than half a million people have been killed since a civil war erupted in 2011 after Assad's government cracked down violently on peaceful pro-democracy protests.\n\nThe rebels broke through the government's defensive lines north of Hama following several days of heavy fighting. The military had sent reinforcements to the city after the fall of Aleppo. But despite support from Russian air strikes and Iran-backed militia fighters, troops were unable to prevent Hama being overrun on Thursday. Rebel commander Hassan Abdul Ghani said in the morning that its fighters were engaged in fierce battles in various districts. In the early afternoon, he announced that hundreds of inmates from Hama's central prison had been released. Minutes later, the military announced the redeployment of troops outside Hama \"to preserve civilian lives and prevent urban combat\". Photos and videos posted online and verified by the BBC showed fighters in several north-eastern neighbourh", "continuation": "oods. The freed inmates were also filmed celebrating outside the central prison with a rebel and a reporter for a pro-opposition news outlet. Abdul Ghani subsequently declared: \"We're pleased to tell you that Hama has been completely liberated after our forces have finished combing operations.\" He also said the rebels had cleared Hama military airport, in the city's western outskirts, as well as Jabal Zain al-Abadin, a strategically important hill just to the north-east that overlooks the Damascus-Aleppo highway. In a video, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani said his fighters had entered Hama to \"cleanse the wound that has endured in Syria for 40 years\". \"I ask God almighty that it be a conquest with no revenge,\" he added. The HTS leader was referring to the killing of between 10,000 and 25,000 people in the city in 1982, when the late President Hafez al-Assad sent in tanks and artillery to crush an Islamist uprising. Similar tactics have been employed across the country by his son, Bashar, over the past 13 years.\n\nThe UN says the escalation has displaced more than 280,000 people in north-western Syria\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, says more than 820 people - most of them combatants, but also including 111 civilians - have been killed across the country since the start of the rebel offensive eight days ago. The UN has said the fighting is also \"worsening an already horrific situation for civilians in the north of the county\". An estimated 280,000 people have been displaced, most of them women and children, and some civilians are trapped in front-line areas unable to reach safer locations. In Aleppo, home to two million people, some public services and critical facilities - including hospitals, bakeries, power stations, water, internet and telecommunications - are meanwhile disrupted or non-functional because of shortages of supplies and personnel. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged \"all those with influence to do their part\" to end the civil war. \"We are seeing the bitter fruits of a chronic collective failure of previous de-escalation arrangements to produce a genuine nationwide ceasefire or a serious political process,\" he added. \"These must change.\"\n\nPresident Assad has vowed to \"crush\" the rebels and accused Western powers of trying to redraw the map of the region, while his key allies Russia and Iran have offered their \"unconditional support\". Russian warplanes have intensified their strikes on rebel-held areas in recent days, Iran-backed militias have sent fighters to reinforce the government's defensive lines, and Iran has said it is ready to send additional forces to Syria if asked. Turkey, which supports the Syrian opposition but has denied reports that it is involved in the HTS-led offensive, has urged Assad to engage in a political process with the opposition to bring an end to Syria's 13-year civil war. Turkish-backed rebel factions have meanwhile capitalised on the government's retreat in the north by launching a separate offensive on a pocket of territory near Aleppo that was controlled by a Kurdish-led militia alliance, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Turkey, which has a large restive Kurdish minority, considers the Kurds in Syria as a threat.\n\nThe rebels pushed into Hama from the north after capturing the second city of Aleppo\n\nBefore the start of the rebel offensive, the government had regained control of Syria's main cities with the help of Russia, Iran and Iran-backed militias. However, large parts of the country remained out of its control. The rebels' last stronghold was in Aleppo and Idlib provinces, which border Turkey and where more than four million people were living, many of them displaced from government-held areas. The enclave was dominated by HTS, which is designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US, Turkey and other countries because it was al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria until it formally broke ties in 2016. A number of allied rebel factions and jihadist groups were also based there, along with Turkish-backed SNA factions and Turkish forces. HTS and its allies said on 27 November that they had launched an offensive to \"deter aggression\", accusing the government and allied Iran-backed militias of escalating attacks on civilians in the north-west. But it came at a time when the government's allies were preoccupied with other conflicts. The Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, which was crucial in helping push back rebels in the early years of the war, has suffered recently from Israel's offensive in Lebanon. Its new leader Naim Qassem said on Thursday that it would \"be by Syria's side in thwarting the goals of this aggression as much as we can\". Israeli strikes have also eliminated Iranian military commanders in Syria and degraded supply lines to pro-government militias there. Russia has also been also distracted by the war in Ukraine."}

He also appeared alongside then-Prime Minister Theresa May at a media conference.\n\nKurdish-born SNP councillor Roza Salih said she was \"disgusted\" by Mr Yousaf's meeting with Mr Erdogan in December as Turkey had stepped up attacks on Kurdish groups in Syria.\n\nThe UK government also threatened to withdraw support for Scottish ministers during overseas visits since no UK official was present.\n\nThe Turkish government has been accused of human rights abuses against Kurds\n\nBefore being questioned about the invite to the Turkish president, Mr Yousaf told BBC Radio 4's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast that he had concerns about his own party's title.\n\n\"I've never really been comfortable with the fact that we have national in our party's name,\" he said.\n\nThe first minister explained that was not because he thought founding members of the SNP had any \"far-right nationalist inclination\" but because the term can be \"misinterpreted\".\n\nHe told the podcast that the SNP had developed a \"very strong brand\" based on being a \"civic national party\".\n\n\"We're a party that believes it doesn't matter really where you come from - what's important is where are we going together,\" the SNP leader said.\n\n\"And there's no doubt about our politics being very routed in the left and the centre left of political discourse.\"\n\nFormer SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said in 2017 that she would have changed the SNP's name if she could \"turn the clock back\" as she believed the word \"national\" could be \"hugely problematic\".\n\nMr Yousaf succeeded Ms Sturgeon as first minister in March last year.\n\nMs Sturgeon, her husband and former SNP chief executive Peter Murrell and treasurer Colin Beattie have since been arrested as part of the police investigation into SNP finances.\n\nAll were released without charge pending further investigation.\n\nThe arrests were part of Police Scotland's Operation Branchform investigation, which centred on about £600,000 raised by the party for independence campaigning.\n\nMr Yousaf told the podcast the police investigation had been \"one of the most difficult times for the party\" and that it had to work hard to rebuild trust.\n\nFormer first minister Nicola Sturgeon was arrested and released without charge\n\nMr Yousaf also spoke of the weeks that his parents-in-law were under siege in Gaza after the conflict broke out in October. They became trapped during a trip to visit relatives before eventually leaving through the Rafah crossing.\n\nHe said for him and his wife Nadia El-Nakla it had been \"probably the lowest points\" of their lives.\n\nPressed on whether he would accuse Israel of \"genocide\", Mr Yousaf said any potential breach of international law should be investigated by the International Court of Justice.\n\nMr Yousaf told the podcast the benefits of being first minister included being able to \"make somebody's day\" but that \"press intrusion\" was one of the major drawbacks.\n\n\"There's no getting away from it and your family, your children, being in the public,\" he said.\n\nHumza Yousaf's apparent attempt to distance himself from the concept of nationalism seems at odds with his own words as recently as last year when he was running for the leadership of the Scottish National Party.\n\nAddressing SNP members at the first hustings of the contest in Cumbernauld, in March 2023, Mr Yousaf appeared to describe himself as a \"nationalist\" in response to a question about a dispute with the UK government over proposed changes to gender law.\n\n\"The starting principle I would say, for any nationalist, the starting principle must be to defend Scotland's parliament and defend Scotland's democracy,\" he said, adding: \"From me, I'm unapologetic, unequivocal. We must stand up to Westminster's power grab.\"\n\nIn 2017, Mr Yousaf's predecessor as SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon also expressed concern about the party's name and its association with nationalism.\n\nYet she too had previously embraced the term \"nationalists,\" to describe herself and her supporters, for example using it five times during her speech to the party's 2014 spring conference in Aberdeen, including in this phrase:\n\n\"Well, my fellow nationalists, after 80 years of campaigning, the last mile of our journey to independence is upon us.\"\n\nThat was a reference to the history of the Scottish National Party which was founded in 1934 by the merger of the National Party of Scotland under the socialist RB Cunninghame Graham and the Scottish Party of the more right-wing Duke of Montrose.\n\nIn more recent times, defenders of the concept of Scottish nationalism have often argued that it could not be further from the \"blood and soil\" version associated with the Nazis and is actually a \"civic nationalism\" built on values rather than identity.\n\nMr Yousaf used a slightly different phrase in this interview, describing the SNP as a \"civic national party\".\n\nThere is an irony that within hours of making those comments, the First Minister was suggesting that an authoritarian leader, known for his slogan \"One Nation, One Flag, One Motherland, One State\", should visit Scotland.\n\nThe SNP's opponents sometimes scoff at 'civic nationalism', accusing the party of window-dressing a discredited, if not dangerous, concept.\n\nOf course Scottish nationalism does not stand alone. These islands contain a patchwork of nationalisms - British, English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh and more besides.\n\nIt hardly needs to be pointed out that the promotion and defence of some of these identities and their associated ideologies has led to a great deal of blood being spilled.\n\nIt is Scotland's great good fortune - or perhaps it is good judgment - that the debate here about this most controversial of concepts remains peaceful and democratic."}

Ian Gribbin, the party's candidate in Bexhill and Battle, also wrote online that women were the \"sponging gender\" and should be \"deprived of health care\". In posts from 2022 on the Unherd magazine website, seen by the BBC, he said Winston Churchill was \"abysmal\" and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin. Initially Mr Gribbin declined to comment, but later said: “I apologise for these old comments and withdraw them unreservedly and the upset that they have caused.” He said that he himself had been “upset at the way these comments were taken out of context especially when my mother was the daughter of Russian Jews fleeing persecution.”\n\nWhen the comments first came to light, a Reform UK party spokesman suggested they were not endorsements but \"arguing points in long distance debates\". But asked about the comments at a press conference later the party’s Chairman, Richard Tice, said that if people did “inappropriate things” or said “daft things” then the party would “look at it” and “investigate\". Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage said \"every party\" would face issues with vetting candidates due to the unexpected election timing, which had cut short the checks parties carry out. In July 2022, Mr Gribbin posted on the Unherd website: \"Britain would be in a far better state today had we taken Hitler up on his offer of neutrality…. but oh no Britain’s warped mindset values weird notions of international morality rather than looking after its own people.\" The same month he wrote: \"In Britain specifically we need to exorcise the cult of Churchill and recognize that in both policy and military strategy, he was abysmal.\" The previous month he criticised women, writing on the site’s message board: \"Do you think you could actually work and pay for it all too like good citizens? \"Men pay 80% of tax – women spend 80% of tax revenue. On aggregate as a group you only take from society. \"Less complaining please from the 'sponging gender'.\" He added that women are \"subsidised by men to merely breath (sic)\". In January 2022 he posted: \"Men pay 80% of tax. Women take out 80% of expenditures. \"Square that inequality first by depriving women of healthcare until their life expectancies are the same as men, Fair’s fair.\" In December 2021 he wrote female soldiers \"almost made me wretch (sic)\" and were a \"total liability\".\n\nIn the run up to the invasion of Ukraine, he praised President Putin, writing in January 2022 that he had \"shown a maturity of which we can only dream of\". He \"understands the bonds that create more stable societies; the hypocrisy of the West is preposterous as we stare in the face daily the enormous economic equalities created by our deluded neo liberal ideas\", he wrote. In February, Mr Gribbin wrote \"if only the West had politicians of his class\". A Reform UK spokesman initially said: \"Through offence archaeology the BBC has found that Mr Gribbin has made a series of comments about a number of subjects. \"They were written with an eye to inconvenient perspectives and truths. That doesn't make them endorsements, just arguing points in long distance debates. \"His historical perspective of what the UK could have done in the 30s was shared by the vast majority of the British establishment including the BBC of its day, and is probably true. \"Again no endorsement, just pointing out conveniently forgotten truths. \"As for the feminism point, his tongue is so firmly in his cheek one should be able to spot it from 100 yards.\"\n\nThe BBC is aware of at least 16 former potential parliamentary candidates for Reform who are no longer standing because of inappropriate or offensive comments.

{"context": "Two former directors of BHS have been ordered to pay at least £18m to creditors over their role in the collapse of the retailer eight years ago. A court found Lennart Henningson and Dominic Chandler liable for wrongful trading, misfeasance trading and misfeasance over their management of the High Street chain. BHS made headlines when it fell into administration with a billion pounds worth of trading liabilities and pension debts in 2016. It came after retail tycoon Sir Philip Green sold the ailing business to Dominic Chappell, a former racing driver with no retail experience, for £1 in March 201", "continuation": "5.\n\nJust over a year into his ownership the chain went under, resulting in 11,000 job losses and a £571m pensions shortfall. Sir Philip Green was heavily criticised at the time for agreeing to the deal, and later agreed a £363m cash settlement with the Pensions Regulator to plug the gap in the pension scheme. On Wednesday, Mr Justice Leech ruled that Mr Henningson and Mr Chandler, who worked for Mr Chappell’s company Retail Acquisitions, had breached their corporate duties by continuing to trade despite knowing there was no reasonable chance that BHS could avoid insolvency. Each must pay £6.5m for wrongful trading and £5.6m between them for the charges of misfeasance. The men could face additional fines of up to £133.5m for misfeasance trading alongside Mr Chappell who himself faces claims from creditors. Justice Leech will make a further ruling on what more Mr Henningson and Mr Chandler owe later in June.\n\nDominic Chappell was jailed for tax evasion in 2020\n\nFRP Advisory, the company acting as liquidator to BHS, brought the case against the directors on behalf of creditors owed money following the retailer’s collapse. These include the government’s Pension Protection Fund. Claims faced by Dominic Chappell will be considered at a separate hearing this month. The disgraced former entrepreneur was jailed for six years in 2020 for tax evasion. A court heard he failed to pay £584,000 in tax on the £2.2m of income he received after buying BHS. It was also claimed he spent the money on two yachts, a Bentley and a holiday in the Bahamas. According to a 2016, Parliamentary Select Committee hearing, the collapse of BHS “created many losers” but also \"winners\". Along with those who lost their jobs, around 20,000 current and future pensioners faced “substantial cuts to their entitlements”. But it said \"many of those closest to the decisions that led to the collapse of BHS walked away greatly enriched despite the company’s failure”. FRP said it had been working to claw back money owed to creditors and made “very substantial recoveries” since 2016."}
{"context": "US President-elect Donald Trump has picked a former aide, Kash Patel, to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation, an agency Patel has often criticised. A former US defence department chief of staff in the first Trump administration, Patel has been a steadfast supporter of the incoming Republican president. For Patel to take the job, the current FBI director Christopher Wray would need to resign or be fired - although Trump did not call on him to do so in his post. Separately, Trump said he plans to nominate Chad Chronister, sheriff of Florida's Hillsborough County, as head of the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nPatel and Chronister join Attorney General nominee Pam Bondi in filling out Trump's law enforcement picks. All three choices will have to be confirmed by a majority vote in the US Senate. Patel is Trump loyalist who shares the president-elect's suspicion of government institutions. \"Kash is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending justice, and protecting the American people,\" Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media platform, adding that Patel was \"an advocate for truth, accountability, and the constitution\".\n\nBut among Democrats and even some Trump allies, Kash could be seen as a divisive figure. His past proposals have included “dramatically” limiting the FBI’s authority. In his memoir, Government Gangsters, Patel called for an eradication of what he called \"government tyranny\" within the FBI by firing \"the top ranks”. Trump's plan would have Patel replace current FBI director Christopher Wray, who Trump appointed in 2017 for the routine 10-year term. But Wray fell out of favour with the president elect when the FBI assisted with a federal probe into Trump's handling of classified records, a case that has since been dropped. In a statement following Trump's announcement, the FBI said: \"Every day, the men and women of the FBI continue to work to protect Americans from a growing array of threats. \"Director Wray's focus remains on the men and women of the FBI, the people we do the work with, and the people we do the work for.\"\n\nIn the hours after Trump picked Patel, legislators in both parties expressed their support of Wray, the current FBI director. “I think the president picked a very good man to be the director of the FBI when he did that in his first term,” Republican Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota said on ABC News on Sunday. “When we meet with him behind closed doors, I've had no objections to the way that he's handled himself, and so I don't have any complaints about the way that he's done his job,\" he said. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that Wray was originally appointed by Trump, and that US President Joe Biden \"didn't fire him\". “That’s how we approach things, and we would like to ensure that the FBI remains an independent institution insulated from politics,” he said. Also on Meet the Press on Sunday, Democratic Congressman Chris Murphy went further, saying he was concerned that \"Kash Patel is going to only care about protecting Republicans and not care about protecting every single member of the American population\". Meanwhile, some Republicans voiced their immediate enthusiasm for Patel. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson was staunch in his support. \"Kash Patel has extensive experience in national security and intelligence. He is an America First patriot who will bring much-needed change and transparency to the FBI,\" Johnson said. Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, said on Sunday he had encouraged Trump to select Patel. “There are serious problems at the FBI,\" Hager", "continuation": "ty said, also on Meet the Press. “The American public knows it. They expect to see sweeping change, and Kash Patel is just the type of person to do it.” The son of Indian immigrants, Patel is a former defence lawyer and federal prosecutor who caught Trump’s eye after he became a senior counsel to the House of Representatives intelligence committee in 2017. He was hired by Trump as a national security aide in 2019 and a year later was appointed chief of staff to the head of the Pentagon. As well as his 2023 memoir, he has published two pro-Trump children’s books. One of the titles, The Plot Against the King, features a villain, Hillary Queenton, trying to depose King Donald, who is aided by a wizard called Kash the Distinguished Discoverer. Another villain is called Keeper Komey - a thinly-veiled reference to former FBI Director James Comey - and his “spying slugs”, according to the book’s blurb. Patel has often railed against the so-called “deep state”, which some Americans believe is an unelected bureaucratic machine that secretly runs the country for sinister purposes. Patel has also excoriated the media, which he has called “the most powerful enemy the United States has ever seen”. He is also on the board of Trump Media and Technology Group, which owns the incoming president’s social media platform Truth Social. Patel reportedly has had a consulting contract with the company that paid him at least $120,000 a year.\n\nChad Chronister and his wife Nikki DeBartolo pictured during a trip to New York City in 2020\n\nChronister also comes with a long background in law enforcement. He has worked in law enforcement in Florida for 32 years, according to his official bio, and he has served as the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County, Florida, since 2017. On social media, Trump praised Chronister's experience and reiterated his focus on drugs and the US border. \"As DEA Administrator, Chad will work with our great Attorney General, Pam Bondi, to secure the border, stop the flow of fentanyl, and other illegal drugs, across the southern border, and SAVE LIVES\", Trump wrote. Writing on social media, Chronister said it was \"the honor of a lifetime to be nominated\" by Trump."}

{"context": "Isabella Jonas-Wheildon was found dead in a locked bathroom at the East Villas housing complex in Ipswich\n\nA man has been jailed for at least 26 years after killing his partner's two-year-old daughter and abandoning her body in a locked bathroom. Scott Jeff, 24, will serve a minimum term as part of a life sentence for the murder of Isabella Jonas-Wheildon, who was found with \"traumatic injuries\" in Ipswich on 30 June 2023. Her mother, Chelsea Gleason-Mitchell, 24, received 10 years in prison after admitting causing or allowing the death of a child. Ipswich Crown Court heard how the couple, from Bedfordshire, had wheeled Isabella's dead body around in a pushchair for days after her death on 26 June before fleeing from Ipswich.\n\nScott Jeff and Chelsea Gleason-Mitchell were sentenced at Ipswich Crown Court following a seven-week trial\n\nThe pair were also sentenced to three months each for cruelty to a child in relation to cannabis and six months each for cruelty to a child in relation to cocaine, to run concurrently. Gleason-Mitchell was found not guilty of murder at a trial in November. High Court judge Mr Justice Neil Garnham said: \"There she was, a two-year-old child, totally dependent on the two of you. \"Jeff, you subjected that defenceless little girl to a brutal campaign of violence and those attacks were monstrous. She feared what was going to happen next. \"Gleason-Mitchell, you are a weak and spineless person and pathetically desperate.

The couple wheeled Isabella's dead body around in a pushchair for days after her death\n\nWhen speaking in court, Thomas Wheildon, Isabella's father, said: \"Isabella was the most wonderful addition to my life - she was an extension of me and I miss her every day. \"When she died a part of me died and my entire world came crashing down – it has completely changed me and I am a shell of the man I once was. \"Isabella was perfect in every way and had a life so full of promise, but now all my dreams for her will never be realised – I'll never take her for her first day of school. \"Her life was tragically cut short by you wicked, sadistic and vile people. I am so sorry Isabella. I am sorry for not being able to protect you.\"\n\nDuring a seven-week trial the court heard how the toddler suffered \"psychological torment\" and \"physical trauma\" at the hands of Jeff and his \"evil temper\". Frustrated over Isabella's struggles with potty training, he would repeatedly kick and stamp on her and punish her with cold showers, all while her mother \"stood by and did nothing\". The brutal beatings resulted in Isabella suffering injuries usually seen in \"high-velocity traffic accidents\" or when someone has been \"kicked by a horse\". Bone pathologist Prof Anthony Freemont told the court, during the couple's trial, that he had never before seen such a severe pelvic injury in a child in his 40-year career.\n\nIsabella's dead body was found in a locked bathroom in a temporary housing unit in Ipswich\n\nSmiley, blonde-haired Isabella, who was described as \"engaging and happy\", died from a bone marrow embolism as a consequence of skeletal trauma. \"The level of injuries were just truly, truly horrific,\" said Det Ch Insp Craig Powell, from Suffolk and Norfolk police forces' joint investigation team. \"The overall level of abuse and the way in which poor Isabella suffered is truly shocking and the actions of the pair were abhorrent. \"It's not lost on any of us as police officers and parents how shocking it is and the escalation and the speed with which this developed and led to such a tragic end.\"\n\nThe abuse started shortly after the pair, while under the influence of drugs, left their hometown of Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, and fled to the Norfolk coast. After staying at the St George Hotel in Great Yarmouth, they slept inside a tent on a beach in Caister-on-Sea before spending three nights at a caravan park. By 19 June, Jeff and Gleason-Mitchell had moved into the East Villas housing complex in Sidegate Lane, Ipswich, having lied about fleeing domestic violence. Seven days later, Isabella was dead. But, instead of reporting it to the police, the couple decided to act as if she was alive and continued \"living a normal life\". Today the court heard how her body was \"treated with disdain\" after the death and had a \"bag of shopping casually placed\" on top of it in the pushchair. In \"macabre\" CCTV footage seen by the BBC, they could be seen wheeling her lifeless body around Ipswich in a pushchair, all while shopping, drinking and taking cocaine.\n\nThe alarm was only raised when, on 29 June, Gleason-Mitchell told her friend Joanne Gardner that Isabella had been dead in her pushchair for about three days. The following day they abandoned Isabella and left their flat, catching a bus into the town centre before going shopping, to McDonald's and then a pub. The pair then headed to the Corn Exchange pub, in Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, before spending several hours drinking and laughing before being arrested on 1 July.

These works are among the most widely available representations of Christian art, shaping how the world views this biblical event and subliminally divesting those outside the West from influencing it. But over the centuries, artists in India have sought to express their vision of this event by painting Jesus's birth and other Christian themes in their own style. Some have done so consciously, others unconsciously, but the end result is a body of work that breathes new life and meaning into the event of Christ's birth, and Christianity itself. Here are some paintings from Indian art history that present Jesus's birth from a uniquely local perspective.\n\nMughal emperor Muhammad Jalaluddin Akbar is credited with introducing northern India to Christianity by inviting Jesuit missionaries to visit his court. The missionaries brought with them holy scriptures and European artworks on Christian themes which influenced court painters. Akbar and his successors also commissioned many murals with Christian themes and some court painters began infusing these paintings with elements of Islamic art. Neha Vermani, a historian of South Asia, talks about a painting made by Mughal court artists which featured emperor Jahangir in the nativity scene, which traditionally feature Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus. \"Mughal rulers saw themselves as being 'just' rulers, capable of maintaining harmony and balance in their kingdoms; they were 'universal rulers'. Allowing different religions to co-exist was integral to how they saw themselves and wanted themselves to be remembered,\" Ms Vermani says. The 18th Century painting below features typical stylistic elements of Mughal art, including highly stylised figures, vibrant colours, naturalism and ornamentation.\n\nThe Trustees of the British Museum An 18th Century Mughal style painting of the Virgin Mary and child\n\nA 1630 painting of the Virgin and child with influences of Islamic art\n\nBorn in 1887 in what is now India's West Bengal state, Jamini Roy is celebrated for creating a unique visual language by bringing together elements of Bengali folk art and Kalighat paintings - a distinctive art form that originated in the vicinity of a renowned temple in Kolkata city. Ashish Anand, CEO and managing director of art firm DAG says that art critic WG Archer once observed that Christ represented a Santhal figure (the Santhals are an Indian tribal group) for Jamini Roy. \"The simplicity of Christ's life and his sacrifice appealed to Roy, making his paintings on Christian themes at least as important as those on Hindu mythology, all of them rendered in the folk style of modernism that he made distinctively his own,\" he says.\n\nA 1950s tempera on fabric painting of Madonna and child by Jamini Roy\n\nMadonna with Jesus and the Magi by Jamini Roy\n\nBorn in 1902 in the western state of Goa, Angelo de Fonseca is credited with creating unique Christian iconography that married Eastern and Western influences with his Goan sensibilities. In his paintings, Mary isn't depicted as a fair maiden in a blue gown, but looks very much like an Indian woman with brown skin, dressed in a sari and wearing a mangalsutra (a piece of traditional Indian jewellery worn by married Hindu women). Biblical scenes unfold in local settings and feature motifs and elements that speak to an Indian audience. Through his art, he tried to counter the narrative of the West being the cradle of beauty and artistic creativity. \"Fonseca wanted to situate Christianity - which has largely been viewed as a western religious tradition - within the Indian subcontinent. It was from this angst that his watercolours painted Christianity anew,\" Rinald D'Souza, director of the Xavier Centre of Historical Research, Goa, told the BBC."}
{"context": "Women cops forging ties for life with the sex trafficking victims they rescue\n\nLidia (l) and Cristina offer long-term holistic care for the sex trafficking victims they rescue\n\nSeveral years have passed since Cristina and her team, an elite unit of Spanish police detectives, rescued \"Victoria\" from a sex trafficking ring. When they found her, Victoria's life was hanging by a thread - for three years, she had suffered such an extreme level of physical and emotional abuse that she barely felt human. It was the hope of seeing her children again that helped her survive. The police investigation has now ended, but the relationship with Cristina and the rest of the team hasn't. They have continued to play a substantive role in her life - from something as powerful as reuniting her with her children after years apart, to something smaller but no less meaningful: surprising her with a cake on her birthday. It is an autumn afternoon and Victoria [not her real name] gets emotional as soon as she sees Cristina and her colleagues arrive with their present in her local park. She is smiling and glad to celebrate another year with them, but Victoria, in her 40s, says the past was \"tough\".\n\nLidia and Cristina, with their boss Felix Duran, surprise Victoria in her local park with a cake on her birthday\n\nHer childhood in her native Colombia was brutal. Her father disappeared on his way to work one morning in 1986, leaving no trace. Her mother remarried another man who Victoria says raped her younger sister. As the eldest child, she was keen to get a job in order to rescue her siblings from hardship. When a friend introduced her to a woman who offered her a cleaning job in Spain, Victoria thought she had finally struck lucky. But what awaited her in Europe was another kind of misery. She was immediately forced into prostitution. \"I worked 24 hours a day,\" she says. \"I had to sleep with my make-up on and you always had to be [only] in your underwear, ready for any customer who would arrive.\" We can't give details of her rescue, because as a protected witness we need to conceal her identity, but Victoria says she will never forget that sunny morning when she first saw the detectives and ran towards them. \"I looked at them, hugged them and cried,\" she recalls. \"They offered to take me to a safe place, where I could be free without fear.\" Victoria says she was so traumatised by the gang's continual surveillance that she was even asking for permission to sleep. Since then, in partnership with other organisations, Cristina and her team have helped Victoria access psychological support, as well as advice on how to find a job and progress her studies. More significantly, they also worked for months to help ensure the safety of her children. The gang that lured Victoria to Spain had threatened to hurt them back home in Colombia if she ever dared to escape or alert the authorities. They were highly organised and unlikely to be bluffing - the traffickers had texted her children directly in the past and knew where they lived and which school they went to. Cristina and others in the Central Operative Unit - a specialised division of Spain's Guardia Civil that prosecutes the most serious forms of organised crime - worked alongside women's organisations and human rights lawyers for months to legalise Victoria's situation in Spain so that they could bring her family over to join her. The team follows a victim-focused approach, through which women are offered long-term support to help them settle into a stable and safe environment after they have been rescued. The team says it sometimes get teased by other units for sounding more like a \"charity\" than an elite team of criminal investigators, but Cristina is a passionate advocate for what they do. \"We believe in a social and humanitarian process that can restore hope in victims' lives, so they can truly recover and live passionately again.\"\n\nVictoria (back to the camera) has managed to build a new life for herself with the support of the unit\n\nWhile women make up fewer than 10% of Guardia Civil's officers across the board, they make up 60% of Cristina's squad. The head of the unit, Felix Duran, explains their recruitment is a \"priority\". He believes that sex trafficking victims, particularly teenage girls, feel more comfortable giving details to a female officer. Approximately 50,000 trafficking victims are detected across the world every year, the United Nations' Office on Crime and Drugs (UNODC) estimates. Its latest global report on human trafficking, published on Wednesday, external, says there has been a 25% rise in the detection of victims compared with the pre-pandemic period, as \"more children are exploited and forced labour cases spike\". The report finds that women and girls continue to account for the majority of victims detected worldwide, who are mostly trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Spain is both a country of exploitation and a transit hub for thousands of victims trafficked into Europe. Victoria and the other victims were concealed inside an apartment, surrounded by other flats. Victoria felt she was", "continuation": " being abused in plain sight - she believes that the cries for help, the beatings, and the constant flow of men coming in and out of the property, would have made it obvious. \"The neighbours; the postman; everyone knew. They could have killed me and nobody would have asked any questions,\" she recalls. After the lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, human trafficking for sexual exploitation went further underground, the Guardia Civil told the BBC. It says that, while many women are still exploited in public venues, such as bars or on the streets, most documented victims are now concealed in private apartments supplied by traffickers, making it harder for police forces to detect them. Ilias Chatzis, chief of the UNODC Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling Section, says the high involvement of organised crime groups means human trafficking is now increasingly intertwined with other illegal activities, such as drug trafficking or cybercrime. \"A large number of victims remain undetected because sometimes authorities will prosecute the trafficker for some lesser offence, but not for the trafficking crime, so the victim itself would not be recognised as a trafficking victim,\" he told the BBC. For Victoria, she is grateful that her own experience was recognised by the police, and wants to use it to raise the visibility of those victims still waiting to be rescued. \"They gave me another chance not only to live, but to heal and hug my children again.\" She asked the BBC to be referred to as \"Victoria\" because it means \"victory\" in Spanish. \"I go out on the street and I breathe, and I say, 'my God, thank you, I'm alive'. I feel free and that's the best feeling.\" Cristina says she marvels at Victoria's resilience. \"She is an example of how you can survive and overcome such an ordeal\", explains Cristina. \"I often think: 'My goodness, there's so much inner power, such bravery in you.'\"\n\nBBC 100 Women names 100 inspiring and influential women around the world every year.

However, speculation mounted that he had fled the country as even his prime minister was not able to contact him during the rebel sweep into Damascus. On 9 December, Russian media announced that he had been given asylum there - even though there has not been any official confirmation. The Syrian rebel groups are continuing to form a transitional government. HTS, Syria's most powerful rebel group, was set up under a different name, Jabhat al-Nusra, in 2011 and pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda the following year. Al-Nusra broke ties with al-Qaeda in 2016 and later took the name HTS when it merged with other factions. However, the UN, US, UK and a number of other countries continue to designate it as a terrorist group. Its leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, who previously used the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has pledged tolerance for different religious groups and communities. But his group's jihadist past has left some doubting whether it will live up to such promises. UN envoy Geir Pedersen, who met al-Sharaa on Sunday, said Syria must have a \"credible and inclusive\" transition. Qatar has also sent a delegation to Syria to meet transitional government officials ahead of the re-opening of its embassy on Tuesday, 13 years after it was closed. Western countries have not gone as far as re-opening their embassies, but in the past two days the US and the UK said they had been in touch with HTS. The British government made clear the Islamist-led rebel group remains a proscribed terrorist organisation, despite it beginning \"diplomatic contact\" with the group.

{"context": "Michelle Gildernew contested the European election in the Midlands-North-West constituency\n\nThe former MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, Michelle Gildernew, has said she has “no regrets” about running in the European election in the Republic. The Sinn Féin representative contested the Midlands-North-West constituency but lost out on the final seat to Ciarán Mullooly, a former high-profile news reporter with Irish broadcaster RTÉ. Speaking to BBC News NI, Ms Gildernew also justified her decision not to defend her Westminster seat in the upcoming general election. “Everything happens for a reason and I think it was the right time for me to step aside in Fermanagh South Tyrone,\" she said.\n\nShe did not attend the declaration of the final result, which took place in Castlebar, County Mayo, just after 03:00 local time on Friday. Ms Gildernew missed out by almost 5,500 votes, as her party lost the seat it had held since 2014.\n\nShe said Sinn Fein “knew it was a ris", "continuation": "k running two candidates” in the Midlands-North-West constituency. Asked about her future in politics, Ms Gildernew said: “I have no idea.\" Speaking to BBC News NI in Castlebar on Friday, she said her immediate priority is to return home following a family tragedy two weeks ago. Her nephew, Fiachra Ó’Faoláin, died after getting into difficulties in a lake near Aughnacloy earlier this month. Ms Gildernew said her sister needs her now and she needs “to go home to grieve”. She said Fiachra was an “impulsive, creative, generous, funny guy\" and \"a beautiful young man”.\n\nMr Mullooly, who won the final seat in the Midlands-North-West constituency, told RTÉ's Morning Ireland programme that he was \"delighted\" for his team, who he said took on \"the power and might\" of Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin \"without a lot of money\". \"We’re thrilled,\" he said. \"It's an incredible end to what has been an extraordinary three weeks in my life.\"\n\nCiarán Mullooly celebrates after being elected as an MEP\n\nIreland has three EU constituencies which send 14 MEPs to Brussels: Dublin, Ireland South and Midlands-North-West. With the final results now in, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have each won four seats, while Sinn Féin and independents have taken two each. Labour and Independent Ireland have won one seat each.\n\nLast month, after the UK general election was called while she was a candidate in the European elections, Ms Gildernew announced that she would not defend her seat in Fermanagh and South Tyrone. She said her “sole focus” was on the European campaign in the Republic. Her failure to be elected as an MEP means she now holds no major elected position, after serving as an MLA or MP for about a quarter of a century. The five seats in the Midlands-North West constituency were won by Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan, Independent, and Maria Walsh, Fine Gael; newcomers Nina Carberry, a well-known Irish jockey and Fianna Fáil's Barry Cowen, a brother of the former taoiseach Brian Cowen, and Independent Ireland's Ciarán Mullooly.\n\nThe Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Simon Harris and the Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin both travelled to County Mayo for the final stages of the count. Mr Harris said he was ecstatic at his party’s success, while Mr Martin played down suggestions that Fianna Fáil’s three-candidate strategy had hampered its chances of taking a second seat in the constituency.\n\nMs Gildernew has been the MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone since 2017. She also held the seat between 2001 to 2015. She was the first female candidate elected from her party to the House of Commons in more than 80 years since Countess Markievicz in 1918. She was also the agriculture and rural development minister in the Northern Ireland Executive from 2007 to 2011. Ms Gildernew has held senior roles within Sinn Féin, both as health spokesperson and as a member of the party's national executive. The party's vice-president Michelle O'Neill said \"there will absolutely have to be a role for Michelle going forward\". Speaking at a launch of candidates for the Westminster general election the Stormont First Minister told journalists Ms Gildernew \"has been a stalwart in the constituency for so long and she will be back in whatever role in whatever form that will take.\" The party President Mary Lou McDonald described her as \"a formidable woman with an incredible record.\" She added: \"be in no doubt Michelle will feature very strongly within the Sinn Fein team in the future.\"\n\nIndependent Michael McNamara, Sinn Féin's Kathleen Funchion and Fianna Fáil's Cynthia Ní Mhurchú took the final three seats in the Ireland South constituency. Independents4Change MEP Mick Wallace lost his seat as he was the sixth and lowest-placed candidate after the 20th count in the five-seat constituency. They will join Fine Gael's Seán Kelly and Fianna Fáil's Billy Kelleher as MEPs for Ireland South. Counting for the election lasted five days in the Republic. Across the other EU member states, most MEPs were elected on Sunday and Monday. The delays in the Republic were largely blamed on the complex system of proportional representation by single transferable vote. Malta is the only other country that uses this system to elect MEPs. It takes more time compared to having a list system, which is how most other member states run their European elections."}

On Tuesday, 18 people were killed and 130 were injured in missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.\n\nUkrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov has warned that while Ukrainian forces are suffering from a shortage of ammunition, Russia has used more than 600 missiles and more than 1,000 drones in the past two months.\n\nFor its part, Ukraine is fighting mostly by using drones. At the weekend, a drone attack caused an explosion at a major gas export terminal near the city of St Petersburg."}

He is expected to hold talks with Palestinian officials in the occupied West Bank and Israeli leaders.\n\nHis visit comes amid heightened tensions in the region following the assassination of top Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri on Tuesday in Lebanon's capital Beirut. His killing has widely been blamed on Israel. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement.\n\nUnder Mr Gallant's now \"four corner\" plan, Israel would retain overall security control of Gaza.\n\nA multi-national force would take charge of rebuilding the territory after the widespread destruction caused by Israeli bombing.\n\nNeighbouring Egypt would also have an unspecified role to play under the plan.\n\nBut the document adds that Palestinians would be responsible for running the territory.\n\n\"Gaza residents are Palestinian, therefore Palestinian bodies will be in charge, with the condition that there will be no hostile actions or threats against the State of Israel,\" Mr Gallant said.\n\nThe plan was not discussed in any detail in the cabinet meeting and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly commented on it. The meeting is reported to have broken up amid acrimony with some ministers angrily objecting to names put forward for an investigation into the events surrounding the 7 October attack by Hamas.\n\nTalk of the \"day after\" in Gaza has led to deep disagreement in Israel.\n\nSome far right-wing members of Mr Netanyahu's government have said that Palestinian citizens should be encouraged to leave Gaza for exile, with the reestablishment of Jewish settlements in the territory - controversial proposals that have been rejected as \"extremist\" and \"unworkable\" by other countries in the region and by some of Israel's allies.\n\nWhile Mr Gallant's proposals may be regarded as more practical than those suggested by some of his cabinet colleagues, they are likely to be rejected by Palestinian leaders who say that Gazans themselves must be allowed to take full control of running the territory once this devastating war is over.\n\nMr Netanyahu has not publicly talked in any detail about how he thinks Gaza should be governed.\n\nHe has suggested that the war in Gaza may yet last several months, with the avowed goal being to completely crush Hamas.\n\nMr Gallant's plan also outlined how the Israeli military aims to proceed in the next phase of the war in Gaza.\n\nHe said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would take a more targeted approach in the north of the Gaza Strip, where operations will include raids, demolishing tunnels and air and ground strikes.\n\nIn the south, the Israeli military would continue to try to track down Hamas leaders and rescue Israeli hostages, he said.\n\nOn Thursday, the IDF said it had hit areas in Gaza's north and south, including Gaza City and Khan Younis.\n\nKhan Younis, the largest city in the south of the Gaza Strip, was hit by Israeli air strikes on Thursday\n\nIt said it had conducted strikes on \"terrorist infrastructure\" and had killed people who it described as militants, who it said had tried to detonate an explosive next to soldiers.\n\nIt also announced that it had killed a senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad operative, Mamdouh Lolo, in an air strike.\n\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said 125 people had been killed in the past 24 hours across the Strip.\n\nA health ministry official said 14 people - including nine children - were killed by Israeli air strikes in al-Mawasi, to the west of Khan Younis.\n\nThe small town has been designated a \"safe space\" by Israeli forces for displaced Palestinians.

{"context": "The price of a Range Rover starts at £104,000\n\nJaguar Land Rover says it plans to invest more than £1m to help the police fight vehicle crime in the UK. The money will be used to support police operations in theft hotspots, as well as to fund intelligence gathering. Earlier this year, the company’s boss angrily denied reports that Range Rovers were particularly vulnerable to theft. However, owners have complained that insurers have been hiking their premiums dramatically, or even refusing cover. Among them is Meryl Cabellos, a 41-year-old Frenchman who has lived in the UK for seven years, and works in the technology industry. Last year, the cost of insuring his 2017 Range Rover Sport doubled, from £2,000 to £4,000. He then discovered that his insurer would not be able to renew his cover at all this year – and struggled to find a replacement.\n\nMeryl Cabellos says he loved his Range Rover Sport but sold it because the insurance became too expensive\n\nFaced with a best quote of £10,000, and with the car itself losing value rapidly, he decided to cut his losses and sell it. “We’ve been Range Rover customers for many years, and it really feels as though we’re being priced out now,” he said. “We’re just really disappointed. We loved the car but because of the insurance the experience of owning it went downhill so quick.” Insurance costs can vary considerably, with factors such as the driver’s record and experience, as well as where the car is kept and the security features it contains all taken into account. Expensive, luxury cars are often targeted by thieves, because they can be sold abroad at a big profit. That, in turn, can push up premiums. For Jaguar Land Rover, this has become a problem. The company builds a range of premium models, with the Range Rover brand a particular favourite for celebrities, politicians and even royalty.\n\nThat kind of prestige comes at a cost. The Range Rover starts at £104,000 while its smaller sibling, the Range Rover Sport, is on sale from £75,000. But embarrassingly for the company, it also has a reputation for being vulnerable to theft. Earlier this year, JLR’s chief executive Adrian Mardell condemned reports that suggested the Range Rover was Britain’s “most stolen vehicle”. He admitted that vehicle theft by organised criminals was a serious issue in the UK, but insisted his own business had been unfairly singled out", "continuation": ", and that strenuous efforts had been made to improve vehicle security. He accused the insurance industry of failing to take account of all the available information when setting premiums. The police funding is the latest in a series of moves designed to reassure consumers and attempt to bring down insurance costs. Last year, for example, the company set up its own insurance products in an effort to help customers who were unable to obtain cover, though some Range Rover owners claim they have still been unable to obtain quotes.\n\nThe new money, JLR says, will be used to support several police forces “with additional dedicated resources to respond to vehicle thefts across the country”. It will also help pay for a new national policing unit to gather intelligence on vehicle thefts, and increased police activity at the ports used by criminal gangs to ship cars abroad. The company says it is already sharing information with the police to help them find and recover vehicles, and has provided training to some 650 officers. At the same time, it says it has been working hard to make its vehicles less vulnerable to theft. It cites data from the Police National Computer showing that since January 2022 only 0.2% of new Range Rovers and Range Rover Sports have been stolen."}

{"context": "Mike Jeffries was arrested earlier this year, along with his partner and their middleman, on sex trafficking charges\n\nThe former CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F) has dementia and late onset Alzheimer's disease, his legal team has said in a court document filed in New York. Lawyers for Mike Jeffries have requested a hearing to determine whether he is mentally fit to stand trial on federal sex trafficking charges. The 80-year-old was arrested alongside his partner in October and charged with running an international sex trafficking and prostitution business. Both men have pleaded not guilty. A so-called competency hearing has been scheduled for June next year.\n\nMr Jeffries, who ran US clothing brand A&F for two decades, is accused of running a sex trafficking and prostitution business from at least 2008-15. US prosecutors allege that he used his wealth, power and status \"to traffic men for his own sexual pleasure\", and for the pleasure of his British partner Matthew Smith, 61. They said the couple, alongside a middleman James Jacobson, 71, used force, fraud and coercion to make vulnerable, aspiring models engage in violent and exploitative sex acts. All three men have pleaded not guilty to the charges and been released on bond. The FBI began investigating last year after the BBC revealed claims Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith had sexually exploited men at events they hosted around the world.\n\nThe BBC investigation, published in October 2023, found the pair were at the centre of a sophisticated operation involving a middleman scouting young men for sex. In the same month, Brian Bieber, Mr Jeffries' lawyer, said his client was examined several times by a neuropsychologist who later concluded diagnostic impressions that he was suffering from two types of dementia and probable late onset Alzheimer's disease. In the court filing, Mr Bieber added that during an initial meeting last year the former fashion boss \"did not even come close to ", "continuation": "resembling a master's degree-educated individual, who was just nine years earlier the chief executive officer of a publicly traded company\". As a result, Mr Bieber questioned the ability of Mr Jeffries to \"rationally assist\" with the possible factual and legal defences to the allegations he was facing, according to the document. The filing comes after Mr Jeffries' legal team sought a competency hearing, which will now be held over two days on 16 and 17 June 2025. Federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York declined to comment. Mr Jeffries stepped down as CEO and chairman of A&F in 2014, and left with a $25m (£19.9m) retirement package. Alongside the criminal case, A&F, Mr Jeffries and his partner have been defending a civil lawsuit accusing the retailer of having funded a sex trafficking operation. Earlier this month, Mr Jeffries sued A&F after it refused to pay his criminal defence costs, arguing the brand had agreed to indemnify him for all claims arising out of his position. Heather Cucolo, a New York Law School professor specialising in mental disability and criminal law, said there are limited statistics on how the justice system treats dementia but that medical experts would have to weigh in before the judge makes a final decision. \"If Mike Jeffries is found competent, the case will move forward,\" she said. \"But if he's deemed incompetent, and it's found there's no reasonable likelihood that his competency will be restored, then the charges would have to be dropped.\" His partner Matthew Smith and James Jacobson could still face trial but prosecutors would have to rely on independent evidence if Mr Jeffries is also found to be incompetent to testify as a witness, she added.\n\nPanorama investigates allegations of exploitation and abuse at the top of one of the biggest fashion brands in the US.\n\nWorld of Secrets, Season One: The Abercrombie Guys The Abercrombie Guys vehemently deny wrongdoing and an old acquaintance comes to their defence, with a different side of the story."}

{"context": "Why Canadians are angry with their biggest supermarket\n\nA rack of lamb on sale for C$41.81 at Loblaws in 2023\n\nCanada is searching for an international grocer to enter its domestic market, after years of anger from shoppers over high food prices, much of it directed at one of the big players. But would an Aldi or a Lidl solve the problem? Late last year, Emily Johnson took to Reddit to share her frustration with how expensive food in Canada has become. She fixated on one grocer in particular: Loblaw, the dominant food retailer in Canada, boasting nearly 2,500 stores. Her Reddit group - named LoblawsIsOutofControl - was filled with photos of grocery items for sale at seemingly egregious prices, like C$40 ($29.36; £23.06) for 1.4 kilograms of chicken. Soon after, Ms Johnson and others banded together to launch a nation-wide boycott against Loblaw, say", "continuation": "ing they were fed up with the disparity between rising food prices and record profits. The company, which also operates pharmacy and discount grocery stores, made a profit of C$2.5bn in 2023, external - a nearly 10% increase from a year earlier. As anger grew, the grocer’s former president Galen Weston, who has defended the profits, became the de facto face of food inflation in Canada, thanks to his regular appearances in Loblaw commercials and his annual reported salary of C$8.4m. Some even began selling T-shirts featuring a spoof “Roblaw$” logo, which were met with copyright infringement complaints from the grocer. The boycott, which began in May and is set to continue indefinitely, has since sparked a national conversation on how groceries in Canada are priced, and why a company like Loblaw continues to be profitable as more Canadians struggle to afford food. It has also ignited political pressure and scrutiny on the grocery practices of not just Loblaw, but other major grocers in the country. “Groceries did not used to be such an issue but the prices have skyrocketed this past year so we’re going without anything frivolous,” Terra Suffel, a 49-year-old single mother of two living in Toronto, told the BBC.\n\nLoblaw's former president Galen Weston appearing in an advertisement for the grocer\n\nA C$200 shopping spree used to feed Ms Stuffel and her children for the entire week, she said. Now it barely covers lunch ingredients and much-needed pantry items. “We can’t really afford much meat and our main protein is now eggs,” she said, adding that she, too, is boycotting Loblaw. In response to frustrated Canadians like her, Canada’s federal innovation minister has since taken several overseas trips to woo an international grocer to set up shop in Canada, in an attempt to increase competition and therefore drive down food prices. But experts say that any foreign grocer looking to enter Canada’s market faces an uphill battle to distinguish itself from existing players, and that the country’s unaffordability crisis may require a more complex fix. Loblaw has responded to the boycott by saying they remain committed to be the “retailer of choice” for Canadians. In a statement to the BBC, the company added that it was doing what it could to fight inflation and plans on opening more discount stores to make affordable food more accessible.\n\nLike many other countries, Canadians saw the cost of living go up after the Covid-19 pandemic thanks to supply-chain issues and labour shortages. Although food inflation in Canada peaked at a lower mark, 11.4%, than in the UK and US, according to data by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the overall figure does not tell the whole story. A price comparison between the three countries of some everyday items suggests Canada is indeed more expensive for some of those regular shopping basket contents. Canadians are also grappling with a currency that is plummeting in value compared to the US dollar, which has impacted both the price of food imported from the US, as well as Canadians’ overall purchasing power. Rising interest rates, coupled with higher rent and home prices, have also pinched the wallets of many in Canada. “People are feeling (the rising cost of food) because they are also feeling the rise of mortgage payments and other things,” said Jordan LeBel, a marketing professor with expertise in the food industry at Concordia University in Montreal.\n\nAnother issue is the heavily consolidated nature of Canada’s grocery market, said Prof LeBel. The country’s industry is dominated by three large companies: Loblaw (which operates Loblaw's stores), Empire (which operates Sobeys stores) and Metro. They make up nearly 60% of the grocery market share while Walmart and Costco make up much of the rest. In comparison, the US grocery market features more regional players. And while Walmart is by far the most popular chain across the country, there are more than a dozen other grocers meaningfully competing with it. Similarly, the UK’s market is also diverse, with a total of 14 businesses turning over more than £1bn in groceries sales per year. Prof LeBel said the Loblaw boycott is a signal from Canadians who are fed-up with the lack of choice and the country’s grocery behemoths, who lack an incentive to meaningfully tackle rising food costs.\n\nFrancois-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s minister of innovation, science and industry, has been tight-lipped on which international grocers he has been trying to court. But government documents obtained by the Wall Street Journal in April have named 12 potential stores, including Germany’s Aldi and Lidl, France’s Les Mousquetaires, and other companies from Turkey, Spain and Portugal. Discount supermarket chain Aldi already has nearly 2,400 stores in the US. It is also the UK’s fourth largest supermarket. Its chief competitor Lidl has a footprint in the UK and the US as well, though a smaller one than Aldi. Despite their popularity in other countries, retail experts say entering the Canadian market comes with its own unique set of challenges. “The classic mistake all foreign retailers make when coming to Canada is that they think it is the 51st US state,” said Amarinder Singh, a senior director at consulting firm Kantar. In reality, Canadian shoppers are very different, he said. Their needs vary regionally, he said, whether they live in Atlantic Canada or in British Columbia, or whether they call a major metropolitan city like Toronto home.\n\nAn Aldi store pictured here in Texas. The German company already has several US stores\n\nCanada is also a highly multicultural country with 20% born elsewhere and a national grocer must target them to find success, Mr Singh said. Another factor to consider is that Loblaw’s strong loyalty points programme covers 40% of Canada’s entire population. “The issue is how you engage the shoppers, and how you steal the share from the Loblaws and Sobeys and Metros of the world, who have such a strong grasp on this market,” said Mr Singh. Some have said the minister’s international tour is a bit of political theatre ahead of a consequential election for Canadians where the ruling Liberal Party is significantly lagging in the polls. “Going after a big player, you have meetings, photo ops - it looks like you’re doing something,” Prof LeBel said. A spokesperson Canada's department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, Riyadh Nazerally, confirmed to the BBC that Minister Champagne has spoken to foreign retailers about “possible investments in Canada”, but no further details. Canada is working on other measures, like reforming its Competition Act to make it more friendly to new entrants, he added. Prof LeBel said he believes the government should also focus on building up already-existing regional players and small, local grocers. Experts have said that the impact of the boycott on Loblaw is likely limited. Local, independent grocers around the country, however, appear to be benefiting, with some seeing a significant boost in traffic and sales since the beginning of May. Supporting local players, Prof LeBel said, goes a long way in building the local economy and the fabric of a community, while improving competition in the market."}
{"context": "Thousands of people in Brazil have protested against a proposed nationwide law change which would equate abortion to homicide, even in cases where a pregnancy is the result of rape. It would mean women who terminate pregnancies after 22 weeks could be jailed for up to 20 years. Brazil's ruling party opposes the move but conservatives in Congress are attempting to push the bill through. Protesters have gathered in many Brazilian cities in recent days, including Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Brasília.\n\nSome have carried placards reading \"a girl is not a mother\", with much of the anger focused on the impact the law change could have on under-18s. Analysis of crime data , externalshows children aged 13 and younger make up more than 60% of rape victims in the country. Currently under Brazilian law, abortion is legal in very limited circumstances - when someone has been raped, if there is risk to life or if there is a diagnosis of foetal brain abnormality - and can carry prison sentences of up to three years outside of those cases. If this change goes ahead, self-administering or consenting to an abortion could result in a jail sentence equivalent to those handed out in “simple homicide” cases, which range from six to 20 years.\n\nThe law would also apply to health professionals carrying out the procedure. Simple homicide, under Brazil’s penal code, is when a person kills another with intent. The bill has made quicker progress than expected after lawmakers bypassed some procedural stages, leading to outcry from opponents. \"We will not accept a setback,\" councilwoman Monica Benicio told Reuters news agency. \"We will not accept a conservative government negotiating spurious policies over our lives. We will continue to advance until legal abortion is a guaranteed right in Brazil,\" she added.\n\nAfter the vote was pushed through, deputy Sóstenes Cavalcante, who authored the law change, was buoyant and responded by writing \"victory to life\" on social media. The Brazilian government vehemently opposes the law change, with the country's human rights minister Silvio Almeida calling it \"immoral\". In a statement, Mr Almeida said: \"It is difficult to believe that Brazilian society, with the countless problems that it has, is currently discussing whether a raped woman and a rapist have the same value in terms of law.\" His comments came as many activists highlighted the jail sentence for someone charged with rape is around 10 years. While Brazil is led by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's left-wing party, many of the country's lawmakers belong to former President Jair Bolsonaro's right-wing Libera", "continuation": "l Party (PL) and other conservative groups.

{"context": "The Christmas number one race - and how to win it\n\nThis year's Christmas number one single will be unwrapped on Friday, with a mixture of old favourites, new efforts and wild cards all in the running. Last year, Wham! classic Last Christmas topped the yuletide singles chart, remarkably for the first time since its release in 1984, when the original Band Aid kept it off the number one spot. As is tradition, the festive number one will be announced on BBC Radio 1's chart show from 16:00 GMT on the Friday before Christmas. At the time of writing, a stocking full of artists - naughty and nice - are hoping to top the list.\n\nThis YouTube post cannot be displayed in your browser.

It has also been reissued on CD and 12-inch vinyl for its 40th anniversary for the final week of the chart race, giving it a further boost. Another seasonal staple, Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas, is not far behind. Also in this year's mix are Brenda Lee's golden oldie Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree and the latest incarnation of Band Aid. They're joined by a new festive tune by Tom Grennan, while songs by Ariana Grande and Kelly Clarkson have established themselves as returning Christmas classics. Or the chart crown could go to something non-Christmassy - like recent hits by Gracie Abrams, Rose and Bruno Mars, or the fast-rising Lola Young. There was a long period when the Christmas number one was reserved for the latest X Factor winner - seven times between 2005-14 - or novelty charity-fundraising sausage-roll enthusiast LadBaby, a five-time victor between 2018-22. And just like with buying gifts, the key for any artists involved now, according to Official Chart Company boss Martin Talbot, is to step into Christmas with confidence and a strategy, and to go early.\n\nGeorge Michael, Bob Geldof, Mariah Carey and Sir Paul McCartney performed at Live 8 in 2005\n\n\"The singles market is very much dominated by streaming these days, in general terms, throughout the year,\" he says. \"But the Christmas market is the one market where you can sell a lot of physical [copies and] a lot of downloads and actually make a big difference. Because people want to buy gifts. \"That's where Wham! will do really well this year.\" Physical or download sales count for much more than streams in the chart in the digital era.\n\nThis YouTube post cannot be displayed in your browser.

That's an adage not lost on Bob Geldof and the Band Aid team, who are going again with their own 40th anniversary Ultimate Mix, which has made headlines this time after Ed Sheeran said he would have preferred for his vocals not to have been used again because of the song's portrayal of Africa. \"When people engage with charity records, they're not doing it because they specifically want to listen to the charity record over and over again, Talbot notes. \"Streaming doesn't really work.\" Instead, he says: \"It's all about voting. And you cast your vote by buying a download or by buying physical products.\" East 17, Reverend and the Makers and The Celebs are all also having a go in aid of various charities this year, as are South Yorkshire Fire & Rescue.\n\n\"Put your hand up if you can do the high note...\"\n\nMariah's slow-burning 1994 anthem finally topped the UK chart for the first time in 2020, returning to the summit in 2022. Yet despite it being screeched by revellers across the country every December, the unofficial queen of Christmas (her bid to trademark that moniker was denied by US authorities) has never been at the top of the UK chart in Christmas week itself. \"It was the first Christmas song I ever wrote and I was just thinking about all the things that I really did want at Christmas,\" she recently told Rylan in a BBC interview. \"I guess I turned it into, if there's something that you love, it means more than all that stuff.\" Aww. Her tune, like Wham!'s and Band Aid's, has benefitted from being heavily promoted by streaming services like Spotify, Apple and Amazon on their top Christmas playlists.\n\n\"Look, is that Santa already?\": Tom Grennan wrote his Christmas song last summer when he was still wearing a vest\n\nIn recent years, Amazon has thrown its might behind new Christmas songs that are exclusive to its service. They have included Sam Ryder's You're Christmas To Me, which narrowly lost out to Wham! last year, and Ellie Goulding's River, which topped the chart just after Christmas in 2019. This year, Grennan's soulful, lovelorn It Can't Be Christmas is only available via Amazon Music. Grennan, who actually penned the track in Los Angeles in the summer, said it was a \"no-brainer\" for him to team up with the streamer to create his own festive song. She said being asked to come up with an original to go up against the usual suspects was \"such a fun challenge\". The classically-trained star's jazzy number features in Red One, a holiday-themed action movie starring Dwayne Johnson, Chris Evans and Lucy Liu - and made by Amazon.\n\nThis YouTube post cannot be displayed in your browser.

While it used to produce many bona fide pop hits, he believes the concept has been \"ruined\" in recent years, not least by the admittedly well-intentioned LadBaby. \"It became pointless speculating as to what was going to be Christmas number one,\" he says of the LadBaby era. \"Which is why, when he didn't release a song last year, it left this void and it was a void that nobody came along to fill.\" Last Christmas \"won by default\", he says, because it appears at the top of all the Christmas playlists playing \"the same old songs, every single year, in much the same order\".\n\nDue to a crowded Christmas market, Masterson says many record labels began to feel it's not worth worrying about the end of year chart any more. Chart rules dictate that songs released in the last three years are weighted more favourably than those already in the Christmas canon. But even with that factor in their favour, he feels it is increasingly difficult for artists with genuinely good new seasonal songs to \"achieve enough momentum\" to \"get lucky\". \"My view is that if Last Christmas by Wham! gets the Christmas number one again by default, it would be a disaster for the whole concept,\" he concludes. So anyone launching a late bid - be it fans of the late Liam Payne, Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey or Yorkshire Pudding Boy - will probably require a cracking campaign. There have been upsets in the past - fans of Rage Against the Machine's Killing in the Name put a small-but-welcome dint in the X Factor monopoly in 2009.\n\nThis YouTube post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Alternatively, the \"Wicked phenomenon could be really powerful\", meaning Cynthia Erivo and Grande's Defying Gravity could pull off a \"surprise\" as families and friends head for outings to the cinema. US pop sensation Sabrina Carpenter has released a Christmas-centric EP, Fruitcake, which could top the festive album chart, but its tracks don't seem to be in the running for the singles crown. So it's beginning to look a lot like Wham! will be Christmas number one again - just like last Christmas. This year's Christmas Number 1 will be revealed on 20 December on the Official Chart on Radio with Jack Saunders."}
{"context": "Bank accounts locked and cash withdrawn after elderly gave power to law firm partner\n\nElderly and vulnerable people in south-east England have told the BBC how they lost control of their money and property after dealing with a law firm based in Essex. They described how they were persuaded - and sometimes felt under pressure - to grant lasting power of attorney (LPA) to a man called Ron Hiller, a partner in the firm. LPA is a legal agreement in which someone appoints an \"attorney\" to make decisions on their behalf, either for finance or health and welfare. Attorneys are supposed to act in their clients' best interests. But we investigated 30 cases involving Mr Hiller and his firm, Craybeck Law, and found a disturbing pattern of events:\n• None People found they had no access to their bank accounts and no idea how much Mr Hiller was charging for being their attorney\n• None Large amounts of cash were withdrawn without a reasonable explanation\n• None Properties were sold for what owners and others considered was lower than market value, and possessions were cleared and disposed of without owners' knowledge or informed consent\n\nThere has been a massive rise in LPAs in England and Wales in recent years. In 2023, more than one million people registered - a rise of 37% on the year before. I spoke to dozens of vulnerable people, as well as their friends, family and neighbours, who expressed concern about Ron Hiller's business practices. My findings also raise concerns about the potential lack of oversight within the system, and whether the body that regulates attorneys - the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) - is able to deal with such problems. A spokesperson for Craybeck Law has denied any wrongdoing but said the firm could not respond to claims about specific individuals, because of client confidentiality. We made repeated attempts to speak to Mr Hiller in person, including at his home, but he did not respond.\n\nCarole was in her 60s, living alone in a house in Uxbridge, west London. In April 2022 she was admitted to hospital with an infection. She never came back. Her friends and neighbours, Bert and Hazel, wanted to visit her in hospital but Covid restrictions were in place. Then the hospital told them she had been transferred to a care home. They rang the home repeatedly but were never put through. They left messages but their calls were not returned. Within months, Carole's house had been completely cleared out and sold for £355,000 - a low price, the neighbours thought, considering other houses in the street were fetching up to half a million. Hazel and Bert were worried about what was happening, but they had no legal right to know any more details. They wrote asking for my help, as they knew I had investigated a similar case. Together we paid a visit to Carole's care home in the Hertfordshire town of Rickmansworth. Carole told us she was desperate to leave, but was stuck there. She said she had been introduced to Ron Hiller at the care home, and he had convinced her to grant him lasting power of attorney over her finances.\n\nCarole found herself stranded in a care home without ready access to her finances\n\nMost people appoint family members to be their attorney but for Carole, this had not been an option. Her closest relative was Sandie - however, she lived about a 100-mile drive away and suffered from serious health problems. A property and finance LPA can be activated as soon as it is registered. Carole told us she had been in a lot of pain when she arrived at the care home, and her LPA shows she agreed to grant these powers to Mr Hiller straight away. Since that point, she had been without her bank cards and had received no statements. She was also in the dark about how much she was paying Mr Hiller to manage her finances. She had wanted to call Hazel and Bert, but Mr Hiller had given her a new phone that didn't contain any of her old contacts. Carole told us he had advised her to sell her house in order to pay the care home fees, then later told her it had fetched a low price because nobody had wanted to buy in her area. As we sat talking, Sandie looked at her phone and discovered the house was on the market again. This time, the asking price was almost £100,000 more than when Mr Hiller had sold it for Carole.\n\nThe hidden scandal of Power of Attorney - how one man controls the finances of scores of vulnerable people. Read less\n\nAfter meeting Carole in the care home, Sandie asked for detailed accounts from Craybeck Law. What came was a slow drip-feed of bank statements, with no real explanation of Mr Hiller's charges and hardly any receipts. However, they did show that large sums of money had been taken from Carole's account. Her bank card had been used to make a series of £300 cash withdrawals from ATMs in the Essex town of South Benfleet, near Mr Hiller's office. He told Sandie that Carole had authorised the withdrawals - but later, when Carole asked to see invoices, they were not produced.\n\nThe statements also showed a charge for arranging for Carole's house to be cleared. I later discovered the work was given to Silverback Commerical Removals, and that the director of this firm was David James Hiller - the son of Ron Hiller. Craybeck Law denied there was any conflict of interest and said the decision to use Silverback was reached after quotes were sought from alternative providers. Carole has no record of these. I heard a similar story about house sales a few miles away in Watford. Ron Hiller was appointed to oversee the finances of an elderly woman called Elizabeth - her house had been sold for £350,000 after she went to live in a care home. It was then left empty and sold on a few months later for £525,000 - without any signs that improvements had taken place. Craybeck Law said it would not comment on individual cases but told us that the properties it handled were often in poor condition and that sometimes they needed to be sold quickly to cover care home fees, and \"to avoid the risk of a sale falling through\".\n\nMany of the people I spoke to, felt Ron Hiller had put them under pressure to appoint him as attorney. Some also told me they had been introduced to him by care professionals, who had led them to believe he was a qualified solicitor. On the website for Craybeck Law, Ron Hiller is described as a partner in the firm's elder client division. However, the letters after his name - MCICM - denote a diploma in credit management and debt collection. There is no mention of Ron Hiller on the official register of qualified solicitors either. A spokesperson for Craybeck Law denied Mr Hiller had ever given the impression he was a qualified solicitor. They added that changes to the law in 2008 meant that individuals who were not qualified solicitors were permitted to become partners in law firms.\n\nIn the Hertfordshire town of Letchworth, a woman called Petra told me how an NHS social worker called Margaret Falegan had brought Mr Hiller to her house during a professional visit. Petra suffers from anxiety and had previously told Ms Falegan - whom she described as her mental health nurse - that she was having trouble with her bills. She felt she was being put \"very much\" under pressure to grant Mr Hiller power of attorney, even though she felt uneasy about him. The next day, she went to her local Citizens Advice Bureau and - with the help of the staff there - suspended the process. A few weeks later, she received a letter from Mr Hiller. It read: \"I've informed the mental health team, Stevenage, of your decision, as this may impact on the level of support they may have planned to provide you in the future.\" Whatever Mr Hiller had meant by this, Petra read it as a threat. She told me she was still upset about the letter months later, and it had destroyed her trust in the mental health team.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Petra: \"I just wanted to get him out.\"\n\nI have heard of other cases where Margaret Falegan introduced Mr Hiller to potential clients in the course of her professional duties. In one, the appointment was made in spite of objections from the man's relatives that he had dementia and did not understand what he was signing. When I approached Ms Falegan for a response, she denied putting pressure on her clients to sign with Mr Hiller. However, she did not say whether her employer, Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (HPUFT), knew that he had accompanied her on client visits. In response to my findings, HPUFT said it had now launched an investigation into Ms Falegan, as well as other social workers who had introduced Ron Hiller to clients. The trust said it had also raised the matter with the appropriate professional bodies and the police. \"If an NHS or care worker is making introductions between their clients and potential attorneys that is very concerning,\" says consultant psychiatrist James Warner. \"If [elderly or vulnerable people] don't have the ability to decide who they want to appoint as their attorneys, they shouldn't be appointing attorneys.\" Craybeck Law said that when a potential client was introduced to the firm, a qualified individual - usually a social worker - would have a discussion with that person, to ensure they had the mental capacity to make the decision to appoint the firm as their attorney. They said this would take place without a Craybeck Law representative present. It also said the firm had processes to ensure that no individual felt coerced into signing powers of attorney.\n\nIn several of the cases I looked at, Craybeck Law - and chiefly Ron Hiller - not only acted as attorney but also executor of clients' wills. An executor is legally responsible for carrying out the instructions in a person's will and handling their estate. However, in at least two cases, Mr Hiller seems to have ignored the instructions he was given. One client was surprised when I told her that the will he had drawn up for her split her estate between four charities - including one she had never heard of. Another client told me he had not seen a copy of a will Mr Hiller had drawn up for him, and did not understand its contents. Valerie in Borehamwood also appointed Mr Hiller as attorney and executor of her will. After she died in 2022, it emerged that her family had been left out of her will and her entire estate - estimated at about £220,000 - was left to a police charity. Her brother and sister-in-law, John and Kaye, live in Australia and were not well-placed to challenge the will. The fact that family members were no longer beneficiaries also meant they were not entitled to any financial information. \"We couldn't see how much [Ron Hiller] was charging for probate or how much he charged every year for being her power of attorney,\" Kaye told me. Ann Stanyer, a leading lawyer in this field, told me that if an attorney is also the executor of a will, there is much less scope for proper scrutiny: \"They can both operate the powers of attorney during their lifetime and take fees through that, but they can then take big fees from the estate as well.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Sue Mitchell tries to speak to Ron Hiller at his home\n\nCraybeck Law said that the firm was governed by the Solicitors Regulation Authority's (SRA) rules and principles, including strict conduct and ethical guidelines that it upheld. It said that much of what had been put to it was inaccurate and based on second- or third-hand hearsay and that it fully refuted the insinuations made about the way it supported its clients. The SRA has now confirmed it is looking into allegations made in this article.\n\nCarole has now moved out of the care home in Rickmansworth, and into a small flat in Folkestone near her cousin Sandy. She has the added work and expense of buying all the basics for her new home, because Ron Hiller disposed of all her furniture and most of her possessions. However, she is happy to be making a fresh start.\n\nCarole has now cut ties with Ron Hiller and moved to a new flat in Folkestone\n\nHer story, and the others in this article, were only a few of those I heard about Ron Hiller. He has acted as attorney for scores of people - a fact that Ann Stanyer finds odd. \"You've got to run [LPA] properly and you can't possibly do that if you've got volumes of these things,\" she says. \"I have four or five which are active and that's more than enough.\" The Office of the Public Guardian doesn't appear to track when an attorney has an unusually large number of clients. A former senior judge at the Court of Protection, external, Denzil Lush, is concerned that the OPG is not designed to spot potential problems with the system. For instance, if an attorney's powers are revoked by more than one of their clients, the OPG does not automatically look at why this is happening. The issue has caught the attention of Parliament - a private members bill, which has gone to its second reading, proposes greater safeguards. Many MPs feel it is an urgent problem because of the sheer numbers involved. More than eight million people in England and Wales have now registered an attorney to act for them. The system was designed to protect elderly and vulnerable people, but the danger is that without better safeguards, it could be leaving them open to harm.\n\nHave y", "continuation": "ou been affected by the issues raised in this story?"}

{"context": "Saliva tests carried out at home are better at identifying men who are at higher risk of prostate cancer than the standard blood test, new research suggests. The at-home test could identify genetic factors which make men more likely to develop the disease which claims around 12,000 lives a year in the UK. The study was carried out by the Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. They hoped the findings could \"turn the tide on prostate cancer\". The research has not yet been published in a specialist journal.\n\nThe UK does not have a national screening programme for prostate cancer because blood tests are not considered accurate enough and can pick up non-life threatening forms of the disease over aggressive types. Researchers believe the cheap and simple testing method could help catch the disease earlier and save lives. \"It is simple from the patient's point of view... get sent a tube, put your saliva sample into it and post it off,\" consultant urologist Prof Caroline Moore said. Specialising in the detection and minimally invasive treatment of prostate cancer, she told Today on BBC Radio 4 what happens to the samples. \"DNA is extracted from that [saliva] and analysed to look for a combination of genetic variations that are linked to prostate cancer.\" The latest study involved more than 6,000 European men aged 55-69, an age bracket where the risk of developing prostate cancer is increased. The researchers then used blood and saliva tests on a smaller group of those men who were found to have genetic variations in their DNA indicating", "continuation": " a higher likelihood of developing the disease. Preliminary results from the research show the saliva test produced fewer false positives and picked up a higher proportion of aggressive cancers. Currently, men who wish to be tested for prostate cancer need to speak to their GP and have a blood test, which measures the level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in their blood. \"[But] we know the PSA test doesn't find all of the cancers,\" Prof Moore said, adding the men in the study had done the test, but showed normal PSA levels. Following an MRI scan and biopsy, 40% of men with high scores from the saliva test were diagnosed with prostate cancer. For standard blood tests, only 25% of men with a high PSA level will actually have prostate cancer, the researchers said. Institute of Cancer Research chief executive Prof Kristian Helin said the standard blood test “can cause men to go through unnecessary treatments and, more worryingly, it's missing men who do have cancer”. Naser Turabi, director of evidence and implementation at Cancer Research UK, called the study “encouraging” and said “more research is now needed to confirm if this tool can save lives”. Prof Moore said the next step would be a big screening study to find the best test or the best combination of tests, looking at saliva tests, PSA tests and MRI scans, which are a modern alternative to the rectal examination. The preliminary findings were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Chicago."}

DAC Evans of the Metropolitan Police, speaking at Scotland Yard after taking on the national role this year, warned that the search histories it was reviewing showed \"horrific material\" which was being accessed \"readily and easily online\". She said this includes violent, misogynistic, and racist content, as well as extreme pornography, material relating to school massacres and \"incel\" culture.

{"context": "How damaging is the Gregg Wallace scandal for the BBC?\n\nPresenter Gregg Wallace is a national figure, who has been in people’s living rooms several times a week for 20 years. His programmes, most prominently MasterChef, are made by independent production companies. But his name and face are associated with the BBC, and, as allegations continue to emerge, the corporation is under fire. It’s the last thing it needs, so soon after other high profile scandals including the disgraced BBC News presenter Huw Edwards.\n\nThe BBC has questions to answer about the allegations over what it knew about Wallace’s behaviour on and off set, and - if it was alerted to these types of allegations - what it did about them. BBC News has been made aware of two occasions when complaints were made. One, by the radio host Aasmah Mir, related to Celebrity MasterChef in 2017. She says she complained to the production company behind the show and later spoke to the BBC’s Kate Phillips who was then controller for entertainment commissioning. I understand Phillips was later assured that the issue had been addressed. Another complaint, just a year afterwards, concerned Impossible Celebrities, made by a different production company. In a letter from 2018 seen by BBC News, Phillips wrote that she had spoken to Wallace for 90 minutes to make clear what the BBC expected of him. She also confirmed in the letter that many aspects of his behaviour were unacceptable and unprofessional. Six years on, the emerging allegations about Wallace’s conduct raise questions about whether executives - at the production company Banijay and the BBC - reacted appropriately.\n\nBBC chair Samir Shah has said there \"continues to be a sense that powerful people 'get away with it'\"\n\nBut BBC News has not been told whether the BBC executives involved in Wallace’s shows were made aware of any complaints about him after 2018 and the conversation between him and Phillips. If they weren’t, there is some plausible deniability that they thought the issues raised had been sorted. Then again, that defence may only go so far. There are wider questions about how much a TV executive should probe, if they are aware that rumours have begun to swirl. Popbitch, the weekly celebrity newsletter that makes its way into the inboxes of most media executives, had run stories involving allegations about Wallace’s language and behaviour in the past, for example. When does the odd gossipy claim about talent misbehaviour become an issue bosses should take a look at? Should more questions have been asked by the BBC after 2018? Some have made the point that these types of scandals involving high profile TV presenters only seem to emerge when the media shines a light on them. It’s only then, it is argued, that executives take action and launch an investigation. The claim is that before journalists get involved, the executives are more concerned with protecting the star, the show and their bottom line. In light of Huw Edwards, the BBC launched a workplace review into preventing abuses of power. At the time, the BBC chair Samir Shah said there \"continues to be a sense that powerful people 'get away with it'.\" But for me, how the Wallace claims may have been handled isn’t entirely comparable to the Edwards scandal. Huw Edwards was employed directly by the BBC, Wallace is contracted by production companies that make his shows and sell them to the BBC. To put this in context, 326 independent companies made programmes for the BBC in the year 2023/4, accounting for 55% of the BBC’s TV hours. I have picked up some frustration on the corporate side of the BBC that the corporation is taking criticism for a programme that it doesn't make. A BBC insider told me it essentially bought a product from a third party and is now being held to account for the actions of staff in a different organisation. My assessment is that if there were complaints - or claims of bad behaviour on set - the first port of call would have been the production company. But that defence - that the BBC is at arm's length on this one - only goes so far. Audiences don’t make that distinction. In the end, they associate Wallace with the BBC, not a production company. The damage rests at the BBC’s door.\n\nBBC director general Tim Davie has said he would like to ban the word \"talent\" to refer to presenters\n\nThe workplace review will aim to look at how to e", "continuation": "nsure that junior people with less power feel able to speak up, when a presenter is behaving badly. The director general Tim Davie has already said he’d like to ban the word \"talent\" for the BBC’s stars, to help end the hierarchies that can be a part of programme making when powerful, highly paid people with audience recognition are involved. But, understandably, the review won’t have oversight of the independent sector. These are independent companies responsible for their own codes. It would however be useful for the review to lay out what BBC processes are triggered when rumours begin to emerge about a particular star and what the BBC expects from its executives and indeed the production companies it buys programmes from. Philippa Childs, the head of union Bectu, told Radio 4 on Wednesday \"the time has come for the whole industry to come together and accept that there does need to be some independent scrutiny of how broadcasters [and] production companies work, to try and address this endemic problem\". The Wallace story may be a wake-up call for the production sector. For years, we’ve heard about junior staff feeling unable to speak truth to power in these sorts of scenarios. Now, some women are refusing to stay silent. If the sector doesn’t get its house in order, it could be career limiting not just for high profile names but for executives as well. At the heart of this latest story is a star accused of misbehaviour and splashed across the media daily. The presumption of innocence doesn’t always sit well with journalistic endeavours, but it should. Gregg Wallace denies the allegations being made against him. The media doesn’t always play fair when it scents a scalp. But he is entitled to a fair and due process.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox."}

{"context": "Archbishop says Church must 'be changed' over abuse\n\nStephen Cottrell has been the Archbishop of York since 2020\n\nThe Archbishop of York, who will effectively take over as leader of the Church of England next month, has called for change in his Christmas sermon. Stephen Cottrell delivered his remarks as the Church faces criticism over failures in its handling of various abuse scandals. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby resigned last month after he was criticised for not doing enough to stop a prolific abuser. He will not preside over the Christmas service at Canterbury Cathedral. Some victims directly affected by the abuse scandals have spoken about experiencing a difficult Christmas, saying they feel that they are still not being listened to.\n\nOne woman, who says she was sexually abused by a priest, told the BBC: \"I just feel that Stephen Cottrell hasn't really thought about how victims would feel [that he is] the voice of the Church moving into Christmas\". Mr Cottrell, set to take over many of the Church's leadership duties on 6 January when Mr Welby leaves his position, has faced calls to step down. At York Minster on Christmas morning, he talked of the need not just to talk about justice and love but to \"walk the talk\". He spoke of \"the inadequacies of those who talk a good game, but whose words are never embodied in action\". Mr Cottrell also talked of helping the most vulnerable, saying: \"Put the needs of others first - those who are cold and hungry and homeless this Christmas. Those who are victims of abuse and exploitation.\" \"Right now, this Christmas, God's Church itself needs to come to the manger and strip off her finery and kneel in penitence and adoration,\" he said. \"And be changed. At the centre of the Christmas story is a vulnerable child; a vulnerable child that Herod's furious wrath will try and destroy, for like every tyrant he cannot abide a rival. \"The Church of England… needs to look at this vulnerable child, at this emptying out of power to demonstrate the power of love, for in this vulnerable child we see God.\" However, Bishop of Newcastl", "continuation": "e Helen-Ann Hartley criticised the sermon, describing it as \"empty words.

In November, the Archbishop of Canterbury resigned following a report that criticised his handling of John Smyth who abused more than 120 boys and young men. The Church said Mr Welby would be spending \"private time with his family\" this Christmas.\n\nOther bishops have confronted the Church crisis head on in their Christmas messages.

Mr Croft said Christmas was a time to pause and take stock. Churches around the country have focused on a gospel story of hope defying darkness, but this year with an unusually troubled backdrop, local clergy are hearing frustration from parishioners.\n\n\"It's just a magical time for the community, but this month has been really hard to be in the Church of England because of all that's going on. It's an institution that's probably in crisis really,\" said Rev Matt Woodcock, vicar at St Stephen's Church in York. \"There is a sense that people feel really confused and disappointed with what's going on, and just longing for some leadership to get things sorted out,\" he said, adding that he has often felt the need to apologise for the institution to which he belongs. Rev Woodcock said that this Christmas he is focussing on reassuring people that the Church is still there to support them at the local level.\n\nBut one woman has told of her profound disappointment at the response of the national Church leadership to the abuse she says she faced. The woman, who does not want to be identified, says she was sexually abused as a girl in the 1980s by the priest David Tudor. She only discovered last year that Tudor had been allowed back into the Church after suspension and had served as a priest for nine years under Mr Cottrell. \"I will find it difficult to listen to [a Christmas sermon from] Stephen Cottrell and not separate the message that he's putting across from what I know,\" she says. A BBC Investigation revealed that when he became Bishop of Chelmsford in 2010, Mr Cottrell was told about abuse allegations against Tudor, a priest who was banned from being alone with children. Mr Cottrell was later told he had paid an alleged victim, and the Church also settled a six-figure sum with another woman who said she had been abused by Tudor, but Tudor was only suspended in 2019 when a police investigation was launched. The archbishop said that that had been his first opportunity to act.\n\nFile on 4 Investigates: The abuse survivors calling on Archbishop of Canterbury stand-in to resign Listen now on BBC Sounds - or on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 on Tuesday 17 December and 11:00 on Wednesday 18 December\n\n\"All I see is a man that has let me and many victims down,\" says the woman who adds that the Church failed to explain to her how Tudor had returned to the priesthood. The woman talked of this being a particularly difficult Christmas for her because it was her first without her grandmother who died earlier this year. \"When she found out what David Tudor had done to me she never set foot in a church again. She knew what was right and wrong, she felt compassion for me and immediately knew what to do,\" she says. \"It is in complete contrast to the actions of the Church.\" Tudor was arrested in April 2019 on suspicion of indecent assault but the case was dropped in August 2022. He was sacked as a priest this October after admitting sexual misconduct to a Church of England tribunal. Surrey Police said last month they would review allegations of \"non-recent indecent assault offences\" against a man in the light of the tribunal's findings. Tudor has not responded to any of the BBC's requests for comment."}

{"context": "Labour and the Conservatives have been challenged over how they would fund their election pledges, ahead of their manifestos being launched next week. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned the next government would have to cut the scope of what the state provides or increase taxes to maintain levels of departmental spending. Both parties have said they will not raise the rate of income tax, National Insurance or VAT. On the campaign trail on Sunday, Labour announced plans to build more prisons, while the Tories focused on welfare reform and the Liberal Democrats on support for carers.\n\nSpeaking on a visit to Essex, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer refused to rule out spending cuts to public services but said his party would \"not be raising taxes on working people\". \"All of our plans are fully funded and fully costed and none of them require tax rises over and above the ones that we've already announced,\" he said. Labour has already said it would end tax breaks for private schools which exempt them from VAT and close the loopholes allowing some people with non-dom status to avoid paying tax in the UK if it wins power. It has also promised a time-limited windfall tax on the excess profits of oil and gas companies. Asked if he could rule out spending cuts, Sir Keir said: \"We are not returning to austerity. We will grow our economy.\" However, the Scottish National Party challenged Sir Keir to \"finally start being straight with the public and explain where the Labour axe will fall on public services\". The party said £18bn of public service cuts were coming down the line \"because of the decisions made by both the Conservatives and Sir Keir Starmer's Labour Party\".\n\nAppearing on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Conservative Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride was also pressed on how his party would fund their spending commitments. These include £1.3bn to allow higher earners to keep child benefit payments, £2.4bn to raise the tax-free pensions allowance and £2.5bn to introduce mandatory national service for 18 year olds. Mr Stride said his party would pay for these policies by raising £6bn from cracking down on tax avoidance. Asked why this had not already been done already by past Conservative governments, Mr Stride said: \"We have been doing it and there’s more we can do.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Reform UK has said it would save £50bn a year by cutting \"wasteful spending\" and bureaucracy. Asked which public services his party would get rid of, leader Nigel Farage told the BBC: \"It’s not about getting rid of public services, it’s about making them more efficient. \"It’s about the National Health Service not swallowing up huge amounts of money in diversity training, and things like this.\" He called for an \"open debate\" about the future of the health service, arguing \"the NHS is not working the way it was 20 years ago\", despite taking up a higher percentage of government spending. He added that a \"mass simplification of the tax system\" would \"bring us enormous savings\". Reform has said it would increase the threshold when people start paying tax to £20,000 a year, as well as abolishing inheritance tax for all estates worth less than £2m.\n\nOn Sunday, Labour set out plans to build more prisons in England by allowing ministers to bypass the traditional planning process. However, shadow justice secretary Shabana Mahmood declined to rule out continuing a scheme that allows some prisoners to be freed early to deal with overcrowding, despite Sir Keir criticising it. Ms Mahmood said it would be \"irresponsible\" to make a decision on the future of the scheme without seeing figures on how many offenders had been released. Elsewhere, the Tories pledged almost £730m to expand NHS mental health treatment in England as part of moves to cut rising welfare costs.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Lack of prison spaces 'not a money problem', says Labour\n\nIt comes as the parties prepare to launch their manifestos next week, setting out what they plan to do if they form the next government. The Tory manifesto is expected to include a promise to permanently get rid of stamp duty tax for first-time buyers of properties costing up to £425,000. It is also expected to reiterate a previous commitment to scrap National Insurance when it is affordable to do so but it is not thought to include any pledge on inheritance tax. Sir Keir has said Labour will have \"no tax surprises\" in its manifesto, suggesting it will stick to previous pledges not to increase income tax, National Insurance or VAT, as well as the tax changes it has already announced. He has also confirmed the manifesto will include a commitment to recognise a Palestinian state as \"part of the process\" to a two-state solution, alongside \"a safe and secure Israel\". It will also include plans to recruit more teachers and police officers, and to cut net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and those leaving. The Liberal Democrats have said their manifesto \"will prioritise fixing the health and social care crisis\". On Sunday, the party announced it would include a pledge to increase the Carer's Allowance, available to people who look after someone with an illness or disability for at least 35 hours a week, by £20 a week. The Lib Dems said they would also raise the eligibility threshold for the allowance to those earning less than £183 a week, with the changes costing a total of £1.4bn a year.

{"context": "Reform UK has unveiled billionaire property developer - and former Conservative donor - Nick Candy as its treasurer, with the job of raising big money to fight the next general election. It is the latest in a series of announcements by Nigel Farage's party aimed at showing it is serious about winning power. Candy, who is married to Australian singer and actress Holly Valance, who also supports Reform, made his money by buying and renovating properties with his brother Christian. The pair were privately educated, and bought their first property in London in 1995, using a £6,000 loan from their grandmother. They have never disclosed their wealth, but describe themselves as \"self-made billionaires\". The property tycoon was close to former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, donating more than £270,000 to the Conservative Party under his leadership and attending the then-PM's wedding. Now he says Farage could win the next general election - and is promising to raise \"tens of millions\" for Reform UK, telling journalists he will donate a \"seven figure sum\" of his own cash as well. \"This country needs change and I believe the person to make that change is Nigel Farage and I believe he'll be the next prime minister of this country,\" he said as he was unveiled to the cameras at Westminster.\n\nElon Musk has expressed interest in Candy's appointment, amid speculation the billionaire owner of X is looking into offering Farage's party a large donation. Candy said he and Musk exchanged messages following the announcement on Tuesday morning, but the new Reform UK treasurer refused to be drawn on any negotiations. When he was quizzed about the Donald Trump-supporting tycoon, Farage said: \"We don't know anything about Elon Musk other than he is supportive of our position.\" But he joked: \"If people offer us money legally, we'll take it.\" Businesses or individuals have to be registered in the UK to donate to a political party, raising questions about how the South African-born US citizen could give money to Reform. Farage denies Reform UK is becoming a party of millionaires and billionaires, saying the fundraising drive is about getting on an \"even financial footing\" with the other main parties. \"If we do that we will achieve extraordinary things,\" he added.\n\nThere has been speculation Elon Musk is looking into donating to Reform UK\n\nAs well as cash, Reform UK has been gaining valuable contacts in Westminster. Last week former Johnson adviser Tim Montgomerie, a veteran Tory commentator who founded the influential Conservative Home website, announced he was defecting to the party, citing immigration as a policy failure he could not forgive. Farage has a patchy record when it comes to high-profile signings. In his former life as UKIP leader he managed to fall out with figures such as TV personality Robert Kilroy-Silk, Tory defector Douglas Carswell and former EU auditor Marta Andreasen, shortly after unveiling them amid much fanfare. But he has also managed to attract wealthy backers in the past, such as insurance tycoon Arron Banks, who bankrolled his Brexit campaign. He is positioning Reform UK as the party for voters hungry for change - a platform Labour won a landslide election victory on just over five months ago. But Sir Keir Starmer's decision to make difficult", "continuation": " and unpopular decisions at the start of his premiership, along with a number of unforced errors, has seen Labour's popularity plummet, as Reform's has risen. Reform UK sits comfortably in third place ahead of the Liberal Democrats in national opinion polls, and is narrowing the gap with the two main parties. The fledgling party proved incapable of transforming the size of its support into seats at Westminster in July. The Liberal Democrats won 3.5 million votes and 72 MPs through their highly-targeted campaign, whereas Reform UK picked up just over four million votes, but only five seats. Farage is on a mission to learn from the Lib Dems how to make Westminster's first-past-the-post voting system work for his party. Reform UK's new multi-millionaire chairman Zia Yusuf has taken on the job of \"professionalising\" the party - no easy task when it has attracted so much controversy in its short life with its choice of candidates in particular. Farage has faced questions over James McMurdock, the Reform MP for South Basildon and East Thurrock, who has a spent conviction after assaulting his girlfriend in 2006. The party has said it was aware of the previous conviction when McMurdock was selected as a candidate, and believes \"strongly that people can change their lives\". But Reform UK is pledging to vet candidates more thoroughly ahead of next year's local elections in an attempt to avoid embarrassment. One target is the new mayoral seat in Greater Lincolnshire, where former Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns has been revealed as the party's candidate. Reform has so far been seen largely as a threat to the Conservatives - but on the day after the general election, Farage made their strategy clear when he declared: \"We're coming for Labour\". The big parties will be watching Reform UK's recent flurry of announcements nervously - and wondering whether they can keep this momentum up."}

Victor Lee, from Ealing, was found in the Grand Union Canal in north-west London in June last year. Elijah Gokool-Mely, 18, from White City, was convicted of murder and robbery by majority verdicts of 11 to one. A jury at the five-week trial at the Old Bailey found two co-defendants, aged 15 and 16, not guilty of murder, manslaughter and robbery.\n\nMr Lee was attacked on the towpath under Scrubs Lane as he tried to sell knives to his killer. He was stabbed twice in the back and once in the chest and pushed into the water. Although two men pulled him out he bled to death on the bank. Mr Lee had gone to meet the three defendants for \"sinister\" reasons, the trial heard.\n\nVictor Lee bought knives and crossbows online to sell at a profit\n\nProsecution barrister Crispin Aylett KC told the court that Mr Lee had been buying weapons online and selling them for a profit. He sold a crossbow to the defendants who later contacted him to ask if he had any knives to sell. He sent a photograph of three knives and five knife boxes, the court heard. Gokool-Mely returned to the towpath at about 17:30 BST on a bike.

Gokool-Mely claimed he had acted in self-defence after Mr Lee drew two knives on him. He had admitted later boasting in drill lyrics about committing a crime but said this was only to make himself appear important.\n\nFollowing the verdict Det Ch Insp Brian Howie, the senior investigating Met Police officer, said: \"Victor was a young man who was not directly involved with gangs or criminality - he had an interest in buying, fixing and selling bikes. \"He had energy and drive but sadly not enough wisdom. His family have told me that he had an inability to properly assess situations, people or threats.\" Det Ch Insp Howie said it would \"forever be a source of regret\" to him that Victor was able to buy weapons online \"simply by altering the date of birth in his passport\". \"He probably regarded this as an interesting scheme to make some money. But, having met his killer after arranging to sell the weapons via Snapchat, this scheme sparked the events which cost him his life,\" he said. \"Victor had his life ahead of him and his family have been torn apart by what happened to him.

American fashion designer Betsey Johnson said \"everyone in the fashion industry loves the show\".

TV personality Michelle Visage said Williams, best known for her roles in Ugly Betty and Desperate Housewives, has \"absolutely\" always been the perfect person to play Priestly. Visage also spoke to the BBC about the progress the fashion industry is making. \"I can't believe in the film that Andy was called fat when she was a size six,\" she said. \"I would hope things have changed - we have seen some more inclusion and I hope we always hope to progress.\"\n\nModel Elizabeth Hurley said she thought \"every woman's body is now celebrated\" and was keen to see \"how that is shown in this theatre show\".

It is really distant and identifying all the galaxies that make up the bigger structure has taken a lot of time and computing power.\n\nSuch large structures should not exist according to one of the guiding principles of astronomy, called the cosmological principle. This states that all matter is spread smoothly across the Universe.\n\nAlthough stars, planets and galaxies are huge clumps of matter in our eyes, in the context of the size of the universe they are insignificant - and the theory is that much bigger patches of matter should not form.\n\nThe Big Ring is by no means the first likely violation of the cosmological principle and so suggests that there is another, yet to be discovered, factor at play.\n\nAccording to Dr Robert Massey, deputy director of the Royal Astronomical Society, the evidence for a rethink of what has been a central plank of astronomy is growing.\n\n\"This is the seventh large structure discovered in the universe that contradicts the idea that the cosmos is smooth on the largest scales.

Why scientists are using a crossbow to study whales\n\nInside the bodies of humpback whales are clues about how climate change is transforming Antarctica. Our BBC science team crossed the Southern Ocean, with the researchers, on a mission to follow and study the giant whales of this remote, frozen wilderness.\n\nAt 03:00 in the morning there is an almighty crash. Every drawer in our cabin is flung open and contents hurled against the wall. We hit a 12-metre wave. I’m not a seafarer; this is alarming, but apparently not unusual on the Drake Passage - the stretch of the notoriously rough Southern Ocean we are on. We’re aboard a 200-passenger tourist ship, with a team of wildlife scientists, on our way to the Antarctic Peninsula.\n\nResearchers follow the whales and take tissue samples to study the animals' health\n\nOne of the researchers, Dr Natalia Botero-Acosta has an arresting piece of equipment in her hand luggage - a custom-made crossbow. “It’s not a weapon,” she explains. “It’s a scientific tool we use to collect whale skin and blubber samples.” Using the crossbow and a drone, the researchers will carry out up-close health checks on every humpback whale they can find, to work out if these massive mammals are getting enough to eat.\n\nIt is an important question - not just for mighty, 40-tonne humpbacks that travel thousands of kilometres to gorge themselves in the cold seas - but for the health of the ocean and our planet.\n\nHumpback whales migrate thousands of kilometres to feed in the icy waters of Antarctica\n\nIn the rich, freezing seas off the peninsula, penguins, seals and many whales feed on Antarctic krill. These diminutive, almost unimaginably numerous, shrimp-like creatures thrive under sea ice. As the climate warms up, scientists are racing to understand what that means for this ice-dependent food supply.\n\nKrill depend on sea ice - eating microscopic plants that live in the ice\n\nEarly on our first Antarctic morning, in mercifully calm coastal waters, we set out on a small, inflatable boat called a zodiac. Cloud is descending and it is starting to snow. Leading our Antarctic whale research mission is Chris Johnson, who is the wildlife charity WWF’s global expert on whale conservation. In conditions like this,” says Chris, “the best way to find whales is to listen - we’ll switch off the zodiac engine and close our eyes.” The silence is transformational. Multiple, overlapping blows of whale exhalations echo off mountains that rise vertically out of glassy water. Gigantic, hungry humpbacks are feeding in this bay. All around our small boat, animals are breathing, then diving - opening their cavernous mouths to let krill-laden seawater rush in. We head slowly in the direction of the nearest blows and Natalia reaches for her crossbow. The giant mammals build up chemical clues about their environment in their blubber - clues that Natalia plans to collect.\n\nShe picks up one of the crossbow bolts. On the business end, there is a 3cm metal tip that plucks a piece of skin and blubber from the whale’s body. A rubber stopper prevents the bolt from penetrating further: It grabs a sample, then bounces off the animal and floats in the water. “It’s 3cm from an animal that’s 14m long - so it’s like a mosquito bite,” says Natalia. Sure enough, when her bolt takes a nick out of the body of a huge, female whale, the animal doesn’t flinch. It’s a mother, side-by-side with her calf. She seems intrigued - circling our boat slowly, then gliding directly underneath. Her giant head and white pectoral fins - fringed with barnacles - are visible as she slowly floats beneath us. “Hold on in case she comes up,” says Chris. But mother whale glides on, surfacing on the other side of us with a blow.\n\nThe calf is even more curious, raising its head out of the water. The young marine mammal seems to examine us; we’re a strange group of tiny, terrestrial mammals in a small, rubber boat. I can’t stop myself greeting the calf: “Hello, beautiful.” Baby humpbacks spend a year nursing on their mothers’ rich milk. With a hungry, one-tonne newborn, calories are important. “We need to find the most critical feeding habitats for whales, so we can protect them,” explains Chris. The health of whales, he explains, shines a light on the health of the whole Antarctic ecosystem. And whales are physically necessary for a healthy ocean: Humpbacks eat krill, and krill eat microscopic plants that live in sea ice - plants that absorb planet-warming carbon as they grow. Whales then poop (in vast quantities) and fertilise the marine plants. It’s a virtuous, productive cycle that climate change is disrupting. “These are natural processes we rely on for fresh air, food and clean water,” says Chris. “Places like this are important for all of us.”\n\nThere is a group of humpbacks in this bay and Natalia sets up to take another biopsy. She seems in sync with the whale. When it arches its back above the surface, that’s the moment - and the ideal, blubber-rich area - for her to aim for. There’s a gentle “thunk” as the bolt bounces off the whale, taking its nugget of tissue. Back in her lab at the University of California Santa Cruz, Natalia will be able to tell if this whale was hungry, stressed or pregnant from chemical signals, or hormones, that build up in its blubber. “Pregnancy data is so valuable,’ Natalia says. “My colleague previously found that, in years when there is low sea ice, you have lower pregnancy rates. [We’re really seeing] the effect of climate change - and all these conservation threats - on the animals.” Most mature humpbacks here will eat about three million Antarctic krill each day, as they bulk up for a 8,000km journey back to breeding grounds in the tropical Pacific.\n\nFrom the drone, researchers can study feeding behaviour and measure the whales' bodies to find out if they are getting enough food\n\nWhile a single krill is just 6cm long fully-gown, collectively they weigh about 400 million tonnes. That is similar to the combined weight of every human on Earth. The swarms of krill here depend on sea ice - they graze on its algae and survive in its crevices. Marine ecologist Prof Angus Atkinson from Plymouth Marine Laboratory says climate change is a threat to krill. “Since 2017, there has been a worrying decline in Antarctic sea ice,” he says. In 2023, it reached a record low, external, with over 2 million sq km less ice than usual during winter. Another way the team is studying the whales here is from above - with a drone. The remotely controlled aerial cameras mean scientists can record spectacular displays of behaviour that can’t be seen from the surface. Chris launches his drone and we watch a group of humpbacks perform a perfect demonstration of bubble net feeding. Working together, they blow bubbles in a spiral, trapping the krill swarm. Like colossal, synchronised swimmers, they lunge through the middle of the bubble net open-mouthed.\n\nOne whale creates a solo bubble net, then sweeps krill into its mouth with a huge fin. “It’s using its pectoral fin as a tool,” says Chris. The drone doesn’t just provide a spectacular view - it’s used to weigh the whales. Chris explains: “We measure the length and width of their bodies to work out how fat they’re getting during the season.” Scientists have seen evidence of whales “getting skinny” because of a climate-linked food shortages. One study of Southern right whales - that feed on krill, then migrate to the South African coast to give birth - showed that the animals are 20% thinner compared to 30 years ago., external Krill are difficult to count and it isn’t clear if numbers are declining, but research has shown that the population is moving south into colder water. A regular check on humpbacks’ weight will provide more clues. Krill biologist Prof So Kawaguchi from the Australian Antarctic Division says it’s vital to understand the whole life cycle and the behaviour of krill. “If climate change affects the behaviour and distribution of the swarms, some predators are going to suffer,” he says. “Krill could move out of their reach.”\n\nWhales shrinking is an indicator of poor health, explains Chris. “There are multiple causes - climate change, fisheries, ship strikes and underwater noise pollution - it’s all adding up.” There is a krill fishery in the Southern Ocean. The oil is used in to make some animal feeds and supplements. Strict catch limits are designed to protect Antarctic wildlife, but the WWF wants some areas designated no fishing zones to protect whales’ food supply. “We’re advocating closing off really sensitive wildlife feeding habitats,” Chris explains. As Chris looks intently at his drone display, he suddenly calls out: “Mom’s pooping!” The aerial view shows a female humpback relaxing near our boat, right next to a large volume of floating faeces. Biologist Sarah Kienle grabs a large sample jar from the kit bag and leans over the side to scoop some up. The waste has the aroma of highly concentrated rotting fish, but Sarah is delighted. “Whale poop is so hard to find and it contains all this information about what they’re eating. We can even get DNA and hormones from it. It’s liquid, smelly gold!”\n\nBack aboard the ship, the team use a store room as a makeshift laboratory. At a small table, Natalia and Sarah take each sample from its arrow-tip casing and put it in a sealed tube to be transported back to Natalia’s lab. On the ship, the samples go into a freezer. On the long journey home though, Natalia travels with her samples tucked into a small, insulated picnic box. She often asks cabin crew on a flight for ice from the drinks cart to ensure her precious samples are kept as cold as possible. While working from a tourist ship has its limitations, it means the team can work in several sites around the peninsula. “Scientists and the tourists want to get to the same places - hotspots of biodiversity and animals,” explains Sarah, who has joined the team from Baylor University in Texas. The tour company, Intrepid, provides space and facilities for the scientists. For the team, Chris says, being on the ship means access to one of the most remote places on Earth.\n\nTourism can leave its mark. The number of people who make the trip to Antarctica for a holiday has increased dramatically in recent years, external. In the season between 2022 and 2023, a record", "continuation": " 104,000 people visited. Before the 1980s, just a few hundred people came each year. Antarctic adventures have a high carbon footprint, and any visitor - scientist, tourist or journalist - could unwittingly bring in seeds or microbes that do not belong on clothes or boots. Expedition guides on this trip actually vacuum out passengers' backpacks and pockets to help prevent that. Bobbles on hats are discouraged when ashore - they can shed fibres. But there is evidence that experiencing the frozen continent in person can inspire visitors to advocate for its protection. Working in this way also means researchers operate on the tourist ship’s schedule, with just four full days travelling around the Peninsula before heading back across the infamous Drake Passage.\n\nPenguins, seals, fish and seabirds all feed on krill in the icy Antarctic water\n\nOn the last day, two whales the team are following suddenly stop next to an iceberg and stop moving. “They’ve fallen asleep,” explains Natalia. Natalia approaches every animal with care. And she has the best chance to get a good sample from a moving whale - as it arches out of the water. “I’m going to put a bolt in the water, just to make a splash and see if it will wake them up,” she explains.\n\nTwo whales 'snoozing' close to an iceberg in Antarctica\n\nFinally, the two whales stir and Natalia takes her final shot to get one last, precious sample containing information about what is happening to this environment and the wildlife that depends on it. This is a place that humanity depends on too - a productive, icy ocean that helps cool our planet. Working out exactly how it is changing means monitoring it. So the scientists hope to return to this frozen wilderness next summer to keep up their regular health check in on its largest inhabitants."}

Gordon suffered a number of grazes to his body after he accidentally brought the bike to a sudden stop and went “10 feet in the air, chin first” while trying to record a video message for his family. It happened on a recovery ride the morning after his late substitute appearance in the goalless draw against Slovenia on Tuesday. “I could have [been hurt] with the speed I was going down a hill,” he said. “I could have ended up anywhere. It was on the golf course and I’ve managed to land on the only bit of gravel there was.” He added: “I think the moral of the story is that we spend too much time on our phones these days. The moral of the story is to just enjoy the moment without a phone.” Gordon said he has “got a few grazes, a few cuts but it’s not anything painful” and he is available for England’s last-16 game against Slovakia in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday (17:00 BST). Asked if he would mark the incident with an appropriate celebration if he scores, Gordon added: “I’ll put stabilisers next to the pitch maybe and you lot [the media] will get credit for the celebration. I will do it. You’ve got my word.”\n\nMeanwhile, Gordon says England \"need to perform and give people what they want to see\" if they would like criticism over their performances to stop. England have been questioned for the way they played during the group stage of Euro 2024 and were booed by supporters following the 0-0 draw with Slovenia, with empty cups thrown at manager Gareth Southgate. The Newcastle forward is one of the players supporters are calling to come into the team for the match against Slovakia in an attempt to get England’s attack firing. The Three Lions scored just two goals as they topped Group C but Southgate said that \"things are starting to come together\". Talking about criticism, Gordon said: “I don't really care about stuff like that, I actually think of it in a positive way. “If people are being negative it's only because they expect a lot from you, which is a positive thing. If we want that to stop, we just need to perform and give people what they want to see.” The 23-year-old made his debut for England in March and has had an excellent campaign for Newcastle, with 12 goals with 11 assists in 48 games. However, a lot of England’s key players occupy the forward positions and Gordon only played his first minutes of the competition as an 89th-minute substitute in England's final group game against Slovenia. His cameo caught the eye of many and was praised by former England captain Wayne Rooney, who said Gordon should be brought into the starting XI. But Gordon has said he is \"not that guy\" to ask manager Southgate for more minutes. “I just like to try my best and control the controllables,” Gordon said. “I think if I train to the very best of my ability, do the best I can every day, that’s my way of giving him a headache in terms of selection, and the rest I can't control. “Try my best and make selection as hard for him as I possibly can. When or if I’m needed, I’ll be more than ready.”\n\nEngland came into the tournament with a number of fitness issues around key players.

The tourists were reduced to 213-9 on a rain-affected fourth day, needing 33 more to make Australia bat again. However, last-wicket pair Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep played superbly and an upper cut for four from the latter took them past the follow-on mark. That sparked celebrations from the batters as well as in the India changing room, where Virat Kohli was seen high-fiving team-mates and coaches, before captain Rohit Sharma, head coach Gautam Gambhir and Kohli led a standing ovation on the India balcony. Australia had taken three wickets for 19 runs to set up the follow-on possibility, but the absence of seamer Josh Hazlewood - who is likely to miss the rest of the series with a calf injury - was felt as Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc tired.

An hour was lost in the morning while the extended afternoon session was delayed then interrupted twice. It meant time was being taken out of the game for the hosts, but also allowed Cummins and Starc to stay relatively fresh and come back for spells in each session of play. Cummins in particular was superb and hostile, as India struggled to deal with his canny changes in length. The tourists were looking settled when Nitish Kumar Reddy and Jadeja had shared 53 for the seventh wicket, but Cummins got the former to drag on and that opened the door. Siraj soon fell and Jadeja, looking to increase the scoring, holed out to square leg to make the follow-on a real possibility. It is unknown if Australia would have enforced it given Hazlewood's injury, but with the time taken out of the game already and the possibility of further rain on Wednesday, it seems highly likely they would have. However, the option was taken off the table by the brilliance of Bumrah (10 not out) and in particular Deep (27 not out). The pair were able to work singles almost at will as Australia set attacking fields, before Deep's bit of bravery took them beyond the target required. With the pressure released, he then carted Cummins into the second tier over mid-wicket, before the umpires decided the light was not good enough to continue. The unbroken stand of 39 has likely saved the game for India and they will hope that, having been completely outplayed in this game and in the second Test, momentum will now swing back in their favour.\n• None Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport"}

{"context": "French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte led the minute's silence\n\nFrance is holding a day of national mourning after Cyclone Chido devastated its Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte earlier this month. French President Emmanuel Macron led Monday's tribute by holding a minute's silence for the storm's victims. He called for the nationwide remembrance during his visit to the island last week - where he was jeered by some islanders who criticised the slow delivery of aid. It is feared hundreds, possibly thousands, of people died when Chido made landfall off Africa's south-east coast on 14 December, bringing winds of up to 260 km/h (160mph) and 250mm of rainfall in the first 24 hours.\n\nSpeaking after the minute of silence was held, French Prime Minister François Bayrou said it was \"symbolic of our solidarity with all those who are suffering\". \"It is a commitment to ensure that the national community is present, to rebuild Mayotte and to ensure that the people of Mayotte feel surrounded by an entire country,\" he added.

Chido - the worst storm to hit the archipelago in 90 years - flattened areas where people live in shacks with sheet metal roofs and left fields of dirt and debris. At least 31 people are reported by French officials to have died, but the death toll is expected to be much higher with thousands still missing. After Mayotte the storm hit the African mainland, killing at least 94 people in Mozambique and 13 in Malawi. Macron pledged to rebuild Mayotte's devastated infrastructure and homes following his visit. After touring the region in a helicopter to see the devastation, he said that Thursday was a day he would never forget. During the visit he was heckled and faced calls to resign from locals who demanded more aid in devastated areas. Macron responded by telling locals: \"I had nothing to do with the cyclone. You can blame me, but it wasn't me.\" Prime Minister François Bayrou said the tragedy of Mayotte was probably the worst natural disaster in centuries of French history.

Funding talking therapies such as counselling services for an extra 500,000 people would help save the economy £12bn a year by ensuring more working age people currently claiming benefits have a job, the Conservatives said. Since the pandemic, the number of people inactive for health reasons has increased by 33% to 2.8 million, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS), external. Before the election prime minister Rishi Sunak made tackling what he saw as \"sick note culture\" a key theme of his premiership Labour said Mr Sunak was trying to \"disguise the fact that he has caused a spiralling benefits bill\".\n\n\"Work is a source of dignity, purpose and hope and I want everyone to be able to overcome whatever barriers they might face to living independent, fulfilling lives. “That’s why we have announced a significant increase in mental health provision, as well as changes to ensure those who can work, do ", "continuation": "work.\" The Conservatives have pledged to bring forward several reforms first floated by Mr Sunak's government - including reforming disability benefits for those most in need and tightening work capability assessment criteria. The plans would also remove the power of GPs to issue sick notes and transfer this responsibility to specialist work and health professionals. Building on an announcement to support an extra 384,000 people complete talking therapies announced in the 2023 Autumn Statement, the Conservatives said their new funding will allow 576,000 access mental health support by 2029-29, helping more people stay in work. The estimated £730m a year cost would come out of the £12bn of savings the proposals will achieve by 2030, the Conservatives said. The Conservatives say the package of measures will intervene to stop the cost of providing benefits for working age people with health conditions ballooning from £60bn to £90bn by the end of the next parliament. However, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said delivering an extra £12bn of savings from the measures \"looks difficult to the extreme\". IFS associate director Tom Walters said: \"History suggests that reductions in spending are often much harder to realise than is claimed.\" A Labour spokesman said: \"This is the latest desperate announcement from Rishi Sunak, who has once again plucked numbers out of thin air in an attempt to disguise the fact that he has caused a spiralling benefits bill. \"These reheated pledges, old policies and vague promises will not get Britain healthy or benefits under control, and do nothing to solve the fact that £10bn of taxpayers' money was lost to benefit fraud just last year.\" A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: Having left almost 7 million people to languish on NHS waiting lists, the only people to blame for the rising number of people signed off sick are the Conservative government. \"Rather than moving the goal posts to force genuinely sick people back to work, Lib Dems would give people the legal right to see their GP within a week, stopping them falling into long term sick in the first place.\" The IFS has also warned that the next government will have to cut the scope of what the state provides or raise taxes to maintain levels of departmental funding. Both the Conservatives and Labour have pledged not to increase the rate of income tax, National Insurance or VAT. Pressed on how the Tories would fund their spending commitments, Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride told the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme £6bn would be raised from clamping down on tax avoidance.

A transfer of rights could help if necessary.\"\n\nWoolworths originated in the US and operated for 100 years in the UK, having opened its first store in Liverpool in 1909. It had 807 British stores and its closure left more than 27,000 people unemployed.\n\nIt suffered from the economic downturn of 2008-09 and from cheaper competitors eating into its market share. Some analysts say it was also not able to keep up with online shopping.\n\nWoolworth Germany said it was \"unable to confirm any plans for Woolworth to return to the UK market\" but that such a move was not ruled out in principle.\n\n\"Britain is on his [Roman Heini's] bucket list, although nothing is imminent,\" a spokesperson said, adding \"but it may be in the mix for the mid- or long-term future\".\n\nSome Woolworths stores remained boarded up with branding on the shopfront as recently as 2020\n\nIts offerings, however, have changed since it was last seen on the High Street. Previously, it was known for its variety of items including children's clothing brand Ladybird, CDs and confectionery.\n\nUnder Mr Heini's stewardship, Woolworth Germany has pivoted to clothing and homeware, which he says is at \"unbeatable prices\".\n\nHe told Retail Week that 6,000 of the 10,000 products that Woolworth sells are priced at €3 (£2.57) or below. \"To match that online, at least until today, is very difficult, if not impossible,\" he said.\n\nBut a re-entry would not be without its challenges. Disruption to supply chains because of attacks by Houthi rebels in one of the world's busiest trade routes in the Red Sea, plus post-pandemic \"turmoil\" were two of the issues Mr Heini cited as standing in the way of any immediate British revival of the brand.\n\nHowever, as the collapse of Wilko left some people feeling nostalgic for Woolworths, the firm feels it would be welcome in the UK.\n\n\"I don't know of any brands where the recognition will be as high as it is in Britain, without having any stores,\" Mr Heini said.\n\nWoolworth has more than 600 shops, with the majority in Germany but some in Austria and Poland."}
{"context": "The Saydnaya Prison pictured on Monday morning by the White Helmets - a Syrian civil defence organisation\n\nSince the collapse of the Assad regime on Sunday, Syrian civilians hoping for news of their relatives have been flocking towards the country's most secretive and notorious prison, Saydnaya. Established i", "continuation": "n the early 1980s in a small town about 30km (19 miles) north of the capital Damascus, Saydnaya is where the Assad family has held opponents of their regime for decades. Referred to as a \"human slaughterhouse\" by rights groups, external, thousands of people are said to have been detained, tortured and executed at the prison since the Syrian civil war began in 2011. The layout of Saydnaya has been a closely guarded secret and images from inside the prison have never been seen before.\n\nDetails of the prison's layout can only be established based on interviews with former guards and detainees. But information from rights groups and the US State Department have offered an insight into the building which became a powerful symbol of the Assads' brutal and repressive rule.\n\nSaydnaya was for decades administered by the Syrian military police and military intelligence, with construction beginning in the early 1980s. The first detainees arrived at the 1.4 sq km facility in 1987 - 16 years into the rule of President Hafeez al-Assad, Bashar's father. Once fully operational the prison contained two main detention facilities. The White Building was, according to rights groups, mainly built to hold military officers and troops suspected of being disloyal to the regime. It was an L-shaped complex in the south-east of the sprawling complex. The Red Building - the main prison - was for opponents of the regime, initially comprising those suspected of membership of Islamist groups. This wing was noted for its distinctive Y-shape, with three straight corridors spreading out from a central hub. Around 10,000-20,000 people could be housed between the two buildings, according to rights groups that have spoken to released prisoners. Videos circulating online since Sunday - which have been authenticated by BBC Verify - showed a large surveillance room in the prison filled with CCTV screens showing what appeared to be dozens of prison cells.\n\nA 2017 report by Amnesty International citing ex-guards at the prison found that after the Syrian civil war began in 2011 the White Building was emptied of existing prisoners, and prepared instead to house those detained for taking part in protests opposing President Bashar al-Assad's regime. One former officer told Amnesty that \"after 2011, [Saydnaya] became the main political prison in Syria\". The organisation also quoted testimony from former prisoners claiming that those held in the Red Building were frequently exposed to various methods of torture, including severe beatings, rape and denial of access to food and medicine. Housed beneath the White Building is what those speaking to Amnesty called an \"execution room\", where detainees in the Red Building would be transported to be hanged. A former guard said that a list of those to be executed from the Red Building would arrive at lunchtime. Troops would then take those marked for death to a basement holding cell - which could sometimes contain up to 100 people - where they were subjected to beatings.\n• None What just happened in Syria?\n• None 'I met two prisoners who did not know their own names'\n• None HTS leader not only player in Syria's fast-changing future Prisoners who spoke to Amnesty said detainees in the Red Building were typically \"transferred\" from the building in the dead of night - usually between midnight and 03:00. Blindfolded detainees were then led down a flight of stairs into the \"execution room\" in the south-east section of the White Building, before being led up onto a one metre-high platform with 10 nooses from which they were hanged. According to Amnesty, in 2012 the room was expanded, with a second platform with 20 more nooses. In footage shared by rebel-affiliated media after the fall of the regime, fighters displayed dozens of nooses they found in rooms around Saydnaya. It is estimated by rights groups that more than 30,000 detainees had either been executed or died as a result of torture, lack of medical care or starvation between 2011 and 2018. Citing accounts from the few released inmates, at least another 500 detainees had been executed between 2018 and 2021, the Association of the Missing and Detainees in Saydnaya Prison (AMDSP) said in 2022. In 2017, the US State Department claimed that authorities had constructed a possible crematorium on the site to dispose of the remains of murdered prisoners. In the images below, a small wing can be seen adjoining the White Building.\n\nA State Department spokesperson said officials had built the facility as part of \"an effort to cover up the extent of mass murders taking place in Saydnaya prison\". Satellite images released by US investigators showed a structure which they said was a small building converted into a crematorium. Officials said snow melt on the roof of the building helped to back up their claims - adding that at least 50 prisoners a day were being hanged at the facility at the time.\n\nThroughout its history, the facility was heavily guarded, with fortifications surrounding the grounds. The exterior of the prison was patrolled by a detachment of 200 troops from the military, with an additional 250 soldiers from military intelligence and the military police responsible for interior security, according to the 2022 report from AMDSP. Troops from the 21st Brigade of the army's Third Division were chosen to defend the prison because of their strong loyalty to the regime. Soldiers were commanded by officers from President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite minority. Since the downfall of the Assad regime, civilians have been urged to avoid rushing through the perimeter of the prison. Rights groups say the exterior of the complex is known to be heavily mined. A ring of anti-tank munitions runs around the exterior of the prison, with a secondary ring of anti-personnel mines running through the centre of the facility.\n\nImages released by the White Helmets - a Syrian civil defence group - showed high walls topped with barbed wire also surrounding the complex. Guard towers can also be seen dotted around the facility. The Assad regime always denied the accusations levelled against it by international organisations, calling them \"baseless\" and \"devoid of truth\". Amnesty says for families who suspect their relatives have been held in Saydnaya the fall of the regime \"raises the prospect that they could finally discover the fate of their missing loved ones, in some cases decades later\"."}
{"context": "Faced with turmoil, a defiant Trudeau hangs on - for now\n\nIt was one of the worst weeks of his political career, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was ringing in the season. At the Liberal Party's annual holiday gathering, Trudeau put on his party face, despite being blindsided the day before by the snap resignation of one of his most trusted allies, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, just hours before she was due to deliver an economic statement in Parliament. But even as some members of his own party were calling on him to leave, the prime minister struck a resolute, defiant tone as he addressed the party faithful in his dark blue suit and tie. He alluded to his \"difficult\" week, comparing it to a family fight. He discussed being \"audacious\" and \"ambitious\" in the face of adversity, and made pointed digs at his political rival, Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party of Canada. Pundits remarked afterwards that it sounded a lot like a campaign speech, and that despite the latest political turmoil, Trudeau appears to be digging in. That stance did not change on Friday, even after the leader of the country's progressive New Democrat Party (NDP) Jagmeet Singh said he would introduce a motion to topple Trudeau's government in the new year. It was the support of the NDP that had kept the Liberals in power. An election now appears imminent. Yet Trudeau has so far given no indication that he will resign ", "continuation": "soon, though he reportedly told fellow party members that he would take time over the winter holiday to think about what to do. Political observers say Trudeau has often shown a streak of defiance when he is under pressure, something that has helped him weather a number of controversies in his nine years in power. And he has often been underestimated, such as when he won a majority government in 2015 at the age of 44, despite being portrayed by his political opponents as something of a dilettante. But as pressure mounts on him to resign, some of those same experts say he may need a new strategy.\n\nWhen Trudeau first ran for prime minister, three words followed him around: Just not ready. That phrase was the tagline of an attack ad played repeatedly throughout the country as he tried to unseat the incumbent Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a Conservative who had been in power since 2006. It conveyed common criticisms he faced at the time about his young age, his relative lack of experience and his winding path to politics. Trudeau \"sort of meandered around\" in his early life before becoming a drama teacher in Vancouver, said Canadian historian Raymond Blake, seemingly insulated as the well-known and wealthy son of former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. But not long after entering politics, Trudeau adopted a fighting stance. It is a trait that some say he learned from his father, who was known for his charismatic yet combative leadership style, and who is famous for his catchphrase of \"just watch me,\" which he glibly told a reporter at the height of a political crisis. \"His father had an image of really being a resilient, very tough politician,\" said Lawrence Martin, a long-time Canadian political columnist based in Washington DC. The younger Trudeau went on to defy the odds himself by pulling off a historic win for his Liberal party, taking them from third-place in parliament to a majority mandate in his first federal election. \"This kind of makes him feel that he can overcome big obstacles,\" said Mr Martin, adding that, politically, Trudeau operates with \"a hyper amount of self-confidence\". Trudeau's path to power turned bumpy once he had assumed office, after he became involved in a number of political scandals. In his first term, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould - the first indigenous woman to hold the job - quit over what she described as attempts at interference and \"veiled threats\" from top government officials seeking a legal favour for a firm facing a corruption trial. As he vied for a second term in 2019, Trudeau's re-election campaign was rocked by images that were released showing him as a younger man donning brown face on at least three occasions. And a year later, in 2020, Trudeau faced yet another ethics scandal involving a potentially large government contract for a youth charity that had worked with Trudeau family members. But in the face of every setback, Trudeau held on to power. He won re-election twice, making him the longest-serving leader of his G7 peers. \"Trudeau has survived so much,\" Prof Blake said, noting that his political successes and leadership have won the loyalty of many in his party despite the scandals.\n\nWhile Trudeau has weathered many storms, there are signs that his time may be up. For one, history is not on his side. Only two Canadian prime ministers - Sir John A MacDonald and Wilfrid Laurier - served four consecutive terms. Trudeau is also working against a sinking popularity. A September poll from Ipsos suggested around two-thirds of Canadians disapprove of him. Just 26% of respondents said Trudeau was their top pick for prime minister, putting him 19 points behind Conservative leader Poilievre. And then there's the slowly dwindling support within Trudeau's own party. So far, at least 18 Liberal MPs have called for their leader to step down. \"He's delusional if he thinks we can continue like this,\" New Brunswick MP Wayne Long told reporters this week. \"It's unfair to us MPs, it's unfair to the ministers and most importantly it's unfair to the country. We need to move on with a new direction and we need to reboot.\" According to Long, who has driven the push to remove Trudeau, as many as 50 of the 153 Liberal MPs want him to quit immediately. Roughly the same number are Trudeau loyalists, he said, and the rest are on the fence. \"There's still some party loyalists who like him and, you know, want to still support him,\" said Mr Martin, the DC-based columnist. \"But if you had a secret vote of Liberal caucus about whether he should stay on or not, he would be defeated handily.\" The prime minister is also seemingly driven to stay by his disdain for his political opponent Poilievre, Mr Martin observed. \"He does not want to back down, and he does want to take on Pierre Poilievre, whom he detests,\" he said. Trudeau's stubborn perseverance in the face of a dismal political forecast has drawn comparisons to outgoing US President Joe Biden, who abandoned his candidacy months before the November election only after mounting internal pressure. Prof Blake said that Trudeau's legacy, like Biden's, will hinge on how he exits. Fighting a losing battle, he said, could give Trudeau \"a lasting scar\". But the prime minister has a remarkable ability to survive, he noted. \"He's been a survivor, and he hasn't done what's normal. Will normal - whatever it is - fall into place this time? Perhaps, but I'm not convinced.\" Trudeau's dilemma is also similar to one faced by his father, who won three elections in a row, and went on to win a fourth after leaving power for less than a year. But by 1984, more than 15 years after first becoming prime minister, the elder Trudeau - like his son now - faced dire polls. It seemed clear he would not win the next election if he stayed on. He decided to step down, telling the public that he made the decision after taking a walk in an Ottawa snowstorm. Since then, the term \"walk in the snow\" has become synonymous with political resignation in Canada. This Christmas, it remains to be seen whether Trudeau will take his own walk."}
{"context": "'It's part of my DNA': Charli XCX and the fight to save club culture\n\nCharli XCX is performing in arenas this week, but started her career sneaking to raves underage\n\nDon't put away your strappy top and bic lighter just yet - Charli XCX's Brat arena tour has just landed in the UK. Kicking off in Manchester on Wednesday, the gigs will be hoping to keep the mania of Brat summer alive well into the winter months. But could the mega tour give the UK's club scene the boost it desperately needs? \"The clubbing landscape right now, I would say honestly it's quite terrifying,\" London DJ Moxie tells BBC Newsbeat.\n\nMore than 100 music venues in the UK stopped putting on live music last year according to the Music Venue's Trust - with more than half of those fully closing. \"We rely on a lot of students and a lot of students are not going out,\" Moxie says. \"They're prioritising staying in because they can't quite afford to go out. \"Everything has gone up and that's had such a knock on effect on venues.\"\n\nDJ Moxie is worried about the state of clubbing venues in the UK\n\nThe venues that are closing or struggling to stay open are the types of places where Charli XCX honed her craft. Charli's spoken before about getting her parents to take her to raves when she was a teenager and before she was selling out arenas, she was working warehouse gigs. \"She has been around for such a long time and she used to go out - I would be at raves that she was at when she was like 15,\" says Moxie. \"She is opening up the conversation about the sorts of places that have inspired her.\" And as those places start to disappear, Moxi's hopeful that Charli's fanbase will discover a love of club music that has been on the wane. \"Especially if someone like Charli XCX is telling them: 'This is where I've come from, the clubs have made me, it's part of my DNA'.\" It's not just Charli bringing club music to the mainstream either - Fred Again headlined Reading and Leeds festival over the summer and Peggy Gou's had a string of sold out shows.\n\nBrat is up for a number of awards, including the Mercury Prize\n\nBrat is Charli's sixth album and it's up for an armful of awards including three Grammys and the Mercury Prize. Hot on its heels was the remix album, Brat And It's Completely Different But Also Still Brat, and an arena tour. And for top artists headlining arenas, fans are used to paying above the odds. But at Charli's show in Manchester on Wednesday, friends Niamh and Freya say they were \"really surprised\" to only pay £40 each to see Charli XCX. \"We thought it would be more expensive,\" they say. \"It wasn't bad at all - it was really affordable.\" Compare that to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour where, on average, fans spent £206 on a ticket. Regular standing tickets for Beyoncé Renaissance shows cost up to £410 and tickets for Billie Eilish's upcoming UK dates could set you back up to £398. More than half of people in the UK have said high prices have stopped them going to gigs, external in the last five years. For people under 34, two thirds of them have said that's meant they've reduced the number they go to, external.\n\nNiamh (right) dyed her hair green in a nod to the Brat album cover\n\nTasha and Lucas also spent £40 on their tickets and are hoping Charli XCX will give a boost to the clubbing scene.

Tasha says they've always enjoyed the club scene and are excited Charli's brought it more into the mainstream. \"She's the first in our first generation to make that crossover,\" she says. Other fans who spoke to Newsbeat at the gig told us they were new to clubbing and Charli's music had brought them into the scene. \"Party culture died out a bit,\" says fan Amara. \"I hope this revives it.\"\n\nTasha and Lucas love clubbing but say the scene in their hometown is only small\n\nMusic journalist and critic Shaad D'Souza tells Newsbeat he \"has to hope and pray\" that lots of Charli's fans are as excited as Amara about getting into clubbing and going out. He's particularly excited about what Brat could mean for the future of the genre - as well as people going out dancing and supporting venues. \"It's refreshing that someone's going to the underground for new sounds,\" he says. \"Because what we see a lot lately is pop musicians' direct reference points are the history of pop.\" He points to Tate McRae throwing back to Britney Spears as an example, compared to artists like Madonna and Prince taking inspiration from different styles outside of pop in previous decades and bringing them into the mainstream. \"I think that's what Charli is doing here and I think that's something that's been missing,\" Shaad says. \"We lose something when pop references itself.\" As for what the Brat tour can do for the clubbing scene, Shaad believes that, while there's a growing market for big ticket events like festivals and the Eras tour, huge gigs can happily co-exist with a smaller club scene. \"I don't think the big pop tour is eating the small club landscape,\" he says. \"What's closing clubs near me is property development and council regulations - no one pop star is not responsible for clubs closing.\"\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."}

French President Emmanuel Macron said he will be travelling to Mayotte \"in the coming days\", as he pledged to support fellow citizens, civil servants and emergency services involved in rescue efforts.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Cars smashed and walls knocked down following Mayotte cyclone\n\nRescue workers, including reinforcements from France, are combing through the debris searching for survivors. Twenty people have been confirmed dead, but the local prefect said it could be thousands. Macron said he will declare a national day of mourning, in light of \"this tragedy, which has shaken each and every one of us\". Authorities said they were having difficulty establishing the number of deaths due to the large number of undocumented migrants - over 100,000 - in a population of 320,000. Widespread damage to infrastructure - with downed power lines and impassable roads - is severely hindering emergency operations. Supplies have begun to arrive, but there are severe shortages of food, water and shelter in certain areas. Some 85% of the territory remains without power, and about 20% of phones appear to be working. Some areas are beginning to get tap water. But for Amalia Mazon, a 27-year-old midwife from Brussels who has been working at the island's central hospital, access to drinking water and food continues to be a concern. \"The water here is completely yellow. It's unusable for us,\" Ms Mazon told the BBC. \"We feel completely abandoned, and we don't even know if help is coming. We have no news, we have no idea,\" the midwife added.\n\nActing French health minister Geneviève Darrieussecq said the healthcare system in the archipelago had been \"degraded\" by the cyclone. France colonised Mayotte in 1841 - and by the turn of the 20th Century added the three main islands that constitute the Comoros archipelago to its overseas territories. The Comoros voted to become independent in 1974 but Mayotte decided to remain part of France. The island's population is heavily dependent on French financial aid and has struggled with poverty, unemployment and political instability. About 75% of the population live below the national poverty line and unemployment hovers at around one in three. \"The images are apocalyptic. It's a disaster, there's nothing left,\" a nurse working at the main hospital in Mamoudzou told BFM TV.\n\nMamoudzou resident, John Balloz, said he was surprised he did not die when the cyclone struck. \"Everything is damaged, nearly everything, the water treatment plant, electric pylons, there's a lot to do.\" Mohamed Ishmael, who also lives in the capital, told Reuters news agency: \"You feel like you are in the aftermath of a nuclear war… I saw an entire neighbourhood disappear.\" \"It's the hunger that worries me most,\" Mayotte Senator Salama Ramia told French media. \"There are people who have had nothing to eat or drink\" since Saturday, she said.\n\nThe scale of the devastation is overwhelming, say officials, as rescuers search for survivors\n\nFrancois-Xavier Bieuville, the island's prefect, told local media the death toll could rise significantly once the damage was fully assessed. He warned it would \"definitely be several hundred\" and could reach the thousands. Mayotte's impoverished communities, including undocumented migrants who have travelled to the French territory in an effort to claim asylum, are thought to have been particularly hard hit due to the vulnerable nature of their housing. The Muslim tradition of burying the dead within 24 hours also meant documenting the number of those who have perished was more difficult, the prefect said. In addition to aid, 110 French soldiers have arrived to help with the rescue, with another 160 on the way. Some 800 others from the ranks of volunteers helping during emergencies were also being sent to join local police units. After arriving in Mayotte, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said \"days and days\" would be needed to ascertain human losses. The relief operation is being co-ordinated from Reunion - another French overseas territory. French Red Cross spokesman Eric Sam Vah told the BBC the situation was \"chaotic\". He said the organisation had been able to reach only 20 out of 200 Red Cross volunteers in Mayotte and echoed fears about the overall number of deaths. \"The totality of the slums have been totally destroyed, we haven't received any reports of displaced people, so the reality could be terrible in the coming days,\" the spokesman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nCyclone Chido also made landfall in Mozambique, where it brought flash flooding, uprooted trees and damaged buildings about 25 miles (40km) south of the northern city of Pemba. Three deaths have been reported. The cyclone caused structural damage and power outages in the northern coastal provinces of Nampula and Cabo Delgado on Saturday morning, local authorities reported. Guy Taylor, a spokesperson for aid agency Unicef in Mozambique, said \"we were hit very hard in the early hours of this morning\". \"Many houses were destroyed or seriously damaged, and healthcare facilities and schools are out of action,\" he added. Mr Taylor said Unicef was concerned about \"loss of access to critical services\", including medical treatment, clean water and sanitation, and also \"the spread of diseases like cholera and malaria\".\n\nChido is the latest deadly storm to form of such high intensity. It strengthened as a result of its long track over the ocean, says Sarah Keith-Lucas from the BBC Weather Centre. The cyclone would have weakened had it made landfall on Madagascar's rugged terrain. But it is also the case that climate change has an impact - not necessarily in the frequency of storms but in the strength, Keith-Lucas says. The storm has been now downgraded to a \"depression\" and is due to cross southern Malawi, then Mozambique's Tete province, before heading towards Zimbabwe overnight into Tuesday. It may still bring 150-300mm of rain by the end of Tuesday.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

{"context": "Enforcement teams have been conducting raids on businesses suspected of employing people illegally\n\nA BBC investigation has found how, despite a national crackdown, Vietnamese migrants who have arrived in the UK illegally are finding jobs in nail bars and evading detection by authorities. In a quiet suburb of Port Talbot, immigration enforcement officers are searching for a young Vietnamese woman in a pink tracksuit. Minutes earlier she was giving a customer a pedicure in a busy nail bar, but ran out the back when officers raided the shop. The woman was found in a nearby building, and told officers she had arrived in the UK illegally by small boat a few years ago. \"Illegal working is a huge issue for us at the moment,\" said Richard Johnson, the Home Office's Immigration Compliance Enforcement lead for Wales and the West of England. \"It's not just nail bars, it's all different sectors - there's construction, there's vape shops, there's barbers, restaurants and takeaways.\"\n\nEnforcement teams have been conducting raids in nail bars and convenience stores suspected of employing people illegally across south Wales as part of Operation Tornado, external - a national initiative to tackle illegal employment. When the uniformed officers visit other premises, it is a similar scene to the one in Port Talbot - people quickly whip off their masks and pretend they are not working there, while businesses deny employing them. The Home Office said it had ramped up these UK-wide raids this year, carrying out 3,188 visits with 2,299 arrests between 5 July and 31 October 2024 - there were 2,371 visits with 1,836 arrests for the same period in 2023. \"If an employer hires an illegal worker now they can get fined £45,000 for every illegal worker and if they offend again it could be £60,000,\" said Mr Johnson. During the week of Operation Tornado penalties worth up to £4m were issued to more than 50 businesses. However these hefty fines are not deterring everyone. Many businesses are on high alert, with posts on Vietnamese Facebook groups issuing warnings about raids. Others offer services to keep a look out for officers. \"The Home Office and taxmen have been checking around Cardiff. Everyone, immediately avoid the area,\" one post read.\n\nA message posted on a Facebook group that translates as: \"The Home Office and taxmen have been checking around Cardiff. Everyone, immediately avoid the area. Also take note of your working hours and salaries\"\n\nBBC News also came across hundreds of posts from people openly stating they were in the country illegally and looking for nail bar jobs. Posing as a Vietnamese skilled nail technician in the UK without a visa, a team member called a dozen nail bars to see if they would give her work. Within an hour she had two job offers. The employers seemed more concerned about the technician being able to do the job rather than whether they had the documentation to work legally. Hourly rates varied depending on level of experience - basic skills could earn about £30 per day whereas experienced technicians could make up to £160 per day. Other businesses said they were not taking on staff without papers as it was \"too risky\". More than 30,000 people crossed the Channel in small boats this year, with Vietnam making up the fourth largest group - behind Afghanistan, Iran and Syria - with 3,307 arrivals in the year to September 2024. Many Vietnamese migrants have told the BBC they came to the UK seeking work because of failing businesses and debts. Their first step, experts have suggested, is often to access Europe by taking advantage of a legal work visa system in Hungary and other parts of Eastern Europe. Experts told BBC News that many of the people working in nail bars illegally are victims of modern slavery. \"The people who are making the crossing into the UK will often have to pay either through extortion or from being exploited in some form of forced labour or criminality once they arrive,\" said Jamie Fookes from Anti-Slavery International.\n\nOne man the BBC spoke to said it is now harder to find jobs in nail bars and restaurants\n\nDuring our research we spoke to many working in the so-called shadow economy. One man in Birmingham worked in a restaurant from 09:00 GMT until 23:00, seven days a week and was put up in a house with other illegal workers. Another man in his early twenties arrived in the UK by small boat and paid about £16,000 to smugglers to make the journey. When we met the man - who we are calling Nam to protect his identity - he was carrying all of his possessions in a small black bag and had been sofa surfing around the UK for weeks. \"I am in a difficult situation. Jobless. No place to stay. I have to ask friends to let me stay with them,\" he said. When he first arrived in the UK, Nam said he worked in cannabis farms, but moved to less dangerous work in nail bars after he was robbed. He also said the UK smugglers told him \"there were lots of opportunities and the living conditions were good\". \"When I got here I found that wasn't the case.\" He added it was becoming harder to find work. \"I found that things were easier when I just arrived to find jobs in nail bars or in restaur", "continuation": "ants... However, because there's so many people arriving the UK recently it's become much harder.\" Nam now wants to return home to Vietnam. \"My plan is to get a job to start a new, more stable life that would allow me to work and pay back the debts I owe.\"\n\nDame Angela Eagle, the UK government's minister for border security and asylum, said: \"People who come to the UK and work illegally often in extremely poor conditions are sold a false promise about their ability to live and work here. \"Putting an end to this is part of our Plan for Change to dismantle the criminal smuggling gangs making millions out of small boat crossings and restore order to the asylum system.\""}

{"context": "Indian accused of plotting US Sikh murder pleads not guilty\n\nAn Indian man accused of plotting to kill a Sikh separatist in New York City has pleaded not guilty in federal court. Nikhil Gupta appeared for the first time in court on Monday afternoon after being extradited from the Czech Republic and landing in the US on Friday. He is charged by US authorities with trying to hire a hitman to assassinate Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a dual US-Canadian citizen. US prosecutors allege Mr Gupta was directed by an unnamed Indian government official. India denies having anything to do with the alleged plot.\n\nMr Gupta, 52, walked into the Manhattan federal courtroom shortly after 12:30 EDT (17:30 BST) on Monday wearing a blue sweater and black Nike sweatpants, holding his hands behind his back. After waiving the reading of his indictment, Mr Gupta was asked by Judge James Cott to enter his plea. “Not guilty,” his lawyer, Jeff Chabrowe, said on his behalf. Prosecutors asked that Mr Gupta be held in a detention centre until his trial. Mr Gupta’s lawyer said they would file a bail application at a later date, meaning Mr Gupta will be detained for now. His lawyer also complained to the judge during the 20-minute arraignment about the conditions of Mr Gupta's detention. He had not been provided a vegetarian meal since he arrived at a Brooklyn detention facility on Friday, the lawyer said. “Essentially, my client has not been able to eat,” he said. He would also need to be allowed to pray, Mr Chabrowe said. Judge Cott said Mr Chabrowe should speak to him again on Tuesday if those issues had not been resolved.\n\nMr Gupta is charged with trying to hire a hitman to assassinate Gurpatwant Singh Pannun\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the hearing, Mr Chabrowe called the case “a complex matter for both India and the US”. He said people should refrain from “jumping to conclusions” about the allegations against Mr Gupta. “We will pursue his defence rigorously,” he said. Mr Gupta’s hearing was also attended by several Khalistan activists, including one who held the movement’s flag outside the courthouse. Mr Gupta is scheduled to appear in court again on 28 June. In November, US prosecutors charged Mr Gupta with a plot to kill at least four Sikh separatists in North America, including Mr Pannun. The charges against him carry up to 20 years in prison. Mr Gupta paid $100,000 (£79,000) in cash to a hitman to assassinate Mr Pannun, prosecutors said. The hitman, they added, was an undercover federal agent.\n• None The Sikh separatist at the centre of US murder plot allegation Mr Pannun is a dual US-Canadian citizen living in New York. He is the general counsel for Sikhs for Justice, an organisation based in the US that supports the broader Khalistan movement, which calls for an independent homeland for Sikhs, who make up about 2% of India's population. Mr Pannun was designated a terrorist by the Indian government in 2020, an allegation he denies. He was also an associate of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist leader who was shot dead in Canada in his car last year. The murder led to a deterioration in India-Canada ties after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged there were \"credible allegations\" that Delhi had been involved. India denied the accusations.\n• None What US agents knew before a Sikh separatist was killed in Canada In November, the White House said it had raised the alleged assassination plot against Mr Pannun with India at the most senior level.

In January, India's Supreme Court rejected a plea from Mr Gupta which asked it to aid his release and help him get a fair trial.

{"context": "France’s young prime minister, Gabriel Attal, has been accused of an act of classic “mansplaining” after he invited himself on to a broadcast debate featuring his party’s lead candidate for the European elections, Valérie Hayer. Politicians of all stripes have joined in the attacks, saying Mr Attal’s impromptu intervention did Ms Hayer no favours - leaving her looking sidelined and superfluous. “Attal would never have let himself do that if [Ms Hayer] had been a man,” said Marine Le Pen, head of the far-right National Rally (RN). “She may be my political adversary, but the way the prime minister humiliated her … was utterly shameful.”\n\nMr Attal, who is 35 and France’s first openly gay prime minister, appeared unexpectedly on the stage at a radio debate organised on Monday morning by s", "continuation": "tate broadcaster France Info. To sparse applause from the auditorium and embarrassed laughs from Ms Hayer, the prime minister said: “I am so sorry for bursting in like this – I was just being interviewed upstairs, and it’s important to me to come and lend support to Valérie.” He then spoke for three or four minutes about the challenges facing Europe at this weekend’s elections, and the reasons why young voters in particular should choose President Macron’s Renaissance party. At the end of his speech, Ms Hayer had the time he spoke deducted from her allocation. Comments from other opposition leaders immediately flooded in on X, formerly Twitter, asking why Mr Attal couldn’t simply allow his party’s candidate – an experienced MEP – to do the job of leading the campaign herself. “I share the anger that many people have, watching the prime minister – and the president – wiping their feet on Valérie Hayer,” said Marie Toussaint, who heads the list of the Green party.\n\nMarie Toussaint of the Greens said she was appalled by treatment of Valérie Hayer\n\nFor Olivier Faure, who heads the Socialist Party: “Macron and Attal are doing everything to undermine and render invisible their candidate. Every day they are putting themselves in her place.” Ms Hayer – who had little public profile in France before the campaign – faces a likely rout at the weekend at the hands of National Rally under its 28-year-old leader Jordan Bardella. The latest polls put Mr Bardella’s RN at 33%, with Ms Hayer battling it out with the Socialists at around 15%.\n\nCommentators said President Macron and Mr Attal appeared to have lost faith in their top candidate's dwindling campaign – which was why they were both projecting themselves on to the media front line. Mr Attal has already held a two-way election debate with Jordan Bardella – earning angry attacks from other parties who say that Renaissance and the RN have a shared interest in turning politics into a perpetual fight between President Macron and the far right. Mr Macron has also been accused of unfairly using presidential privilege to help his party in the elections, with a major speech on Europe last month and a television interview on Thursday on the 80th anniversary of D-Day. “It’s all a bit macho, isn’t it?” said François-Xavier Bellamy, who heads the conservative Republicans’ list. He summed up Mr Attal's intervention as: \"Listen Valérie, I can do this better than you; I’m going to explain how it works at a European election.\" “Come on, when is this all going to stop?\" he added. \"In the middle of a campaign is it normal for the executive to spend its time saturating the media space?”"}

{"context": "The SNP seems to be rediscovering its political confidence after the bleakest period the party's had since winning power at Holyrood. In the last couple of years its independence strategy has hit a brick wall, the party has tied itself in knots over gender reform, and it has fallen in and out of love with the Scottish Greens. There have been three first ministers during that period and one of those remains under police investigation as the Branchform inquiry into SNP finances drags on. The party's worries have not gone away. Far from it. It still has huge challenges to overcome, not least significant underperformance in key public services like the NHS. Even its selection process for the Holyrood election could be a source of bitter infighting. Yet at the end of the week in which First Minister John Swinney's government delivered its draft Scottish Budget, his team seems more optimistic than at any time for at least two years.\n\nThat may seem odd given the SNP completely lost control of the narrative in Scottish politics and was comprehensively defeated by Labour at the general election in July. There has been an understandable tendency to write the party off. For a while it has felt that Labour was on course to defeat the SNP at the next Holyrood election and to regain devolved power after 19 years in opposition. The most recent opinion polling, external raises questions about that analysis. Labour's \"change\" mantra at the general election seemed to tap into a public appetite for exactly that and it remains perfectly possible they could win. The point is that a change of government at Holyrood is not inevitable. The SNP will put up a fight and it remains a political force to be reckoned with. The budget setting process is a good demonstration of how wily they can be.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves announced an increase in funding for the Scottish government\n\nAt the end of October, the UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves helped put Labour on the front foot in Scotland by announcing a substantial uplift in funding for the SNP government this year and next. As I said at the time, this opened up political space for Labour to turn the focus on the delivery of better public services in Scotland (under SNP administration since 2007). With the publication of the draft Scottish Budget this week, the SNP has managed to seize back some of the political initiative. It has happily banked the £1.5bn extra spending from the UK Treasury this year and the £3.4bn extra next year. Much of this is gobbled up paying growing NHS, social welfare and public sector wage bills. However, the SNP has managed to direct some of that cash to policy priorities that pile political pressure on Labour.\n\nThe UK government's cuts to winter fuel payments have proven controversial\n\nThe Scottish government has promised to partly reverse cuts to winter fuel payments for older people not in receipt of pension credit. These cuts were initiated by the UK government and are being matched by the Scottish government this winter before a new payment is brought in next year. It has also promised to end the two-child cap on access to benefits in Scotland, something that Scottish Labour has previously expressed a desire to achieve. It is clear this policy was a very late addition to the budget statement. It has not yet been fully costed. The Scottish Fiscal Commission's rough estimate is £150m in the first year and it has described the policy as a \"fiscal risk\". Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar initially dismissed the SNP's idea as a \"policy without a penny\" because the first tranche of payments are not in the budget for 2025/26. SNP ministers are proposing to make the change from spring 2026, just before the Holyrood election. However, they insist there is £3m in their budget plans to make the necessary preparations.\n\nJohn Swinney and Sir Keir Starmer held talks at the British Irish Council meeting in Edinburgh\n\nJohn Swinney and Sir Keir Starmer held talks at the British Irish Council meeting in Edinburgh\n\nThey have also formally requested assistance from the UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to access the data required to establish who would be eligible for extra cash. They may also need the UK government to tweak the law so that anything extra paid out in Scotland is not simply clawed back by another part of the system. The DWP has said it will \"engage constructively with the Scottish government where necessary\" - which may or may not be an expression of willingness to assist. On Thursday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said ending the two child cap was not a \"silver bullet\" for tackling child poverty and that the policy could not be afforded across the UK. On Friday, he held private talks with John Swinney in Edinburgh, after which Mr Swinney said the PM had agreed to work with him on the two-child cap. Having reset the relationship with the devolved governments since taking power at Westminster, Labour's commitment to partnership politics is now being tested by the SNP.\n\nAt Holyrood, Scottish Labour also has a Budget dilemma. It is perfectly entitled to criticise the SNP's approach to taxation and public spending. The question is: Can Labour afford not to back a Scottish Budget that includes winter fuel cash for pensioners and a pathway to ending the two-child cap? The SNP is not counting on their votes but if it does not get them, it will never tire of reminding voters of what Labour chose not to support. In that sense, this is a politically savvy budget from John Swinney's administration. It also includes policy suggestions from the Greens, the Liberal Democrats and the Alba party, which are more likely allies. There is no expectation of Conservative support. They are firmly opposed to the SNP's approach to taxation,", "continuation": " which requires higher earners to pay more than they would in England to raise extra funds for public spending. All parties know there needs to be a budget deal before key votes in February. Otherwise there could be chaos in disbursing public money to pay bills and deliver promised wage increases to public servants. It's not clear any party would want to risk being held responsible for that - or the possibility of an early Holyrood election."}
{"context": "Businessman Doug Barrowman is married to former Tory peer Baroness Michelle Mone\n\nThe husband of ex-Tory peer Michelle Mone is connected to a company that tax experts say should be investigated for fraud, BBC Newsnight has found.\n\nDoug Barrowman has previously denied involvement in Vanquish Options, a firm that falsely claimed customers could write off money owed to the government.\n\nBut BBC News has identified Vanquish bosses with links to Mr Barrowman and seen emails sent by Vanquish from the same IP address as his Isle of Man HQ.\n\nTax experts suggest there are grounds to open a criminal investigation into Vanquish Options.\n\nOne of Mr Barrowman's firms, PPE MedPro, is already being investigated by the National Crime Agency over contracts worth more than £200m to supply PPE to the NHS during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn March 2022, a company owned by Mr Barrowman, called AML Tax (UK) Limited, was fined £150,000 by a tax tribunal.\n\nHMRC, the UK's tax authority, said the firm was part of Mr Barrowman's Isle of Man-based Knox Group, and accused it of \"aggressively\" promoting tax avoidance schemes in the UK. HMRC referred to the firm as \"Doug Barrowman's tax avoidance firm\".\n\nHis company sold schemes to self-employed contractors in the 2010s, on the promise they could avoid UK income tax by having their earnings funnelled into an offshore trust.\n\nThe trust would then transfer the cash back to the contractor as a loan, which would supposedly never need to be repaid. Loans, unlike wages, are not subject to income tax. But the government clamped down on the schemes in 2016, bringing in new legislation.\n\nThis made those who had accrued such offshore loans liable for \"loan charges\", effectively requiring them to retrospectively pay back the income tax they had avoided.\n\nBBC News has spoken to contractors who subscribed to the AML scheme in 2011 and were left with huge tax bills.\n\nOne of them is Doug Adams, who is facing a £90,000 loan charge from HMRC and says the financial fallout and stress has had a disastrous impact on his mental and physical health. He links it to the breakdown of his marriage and a divorce settlement that is forcing him to sell his home.\n\n\"It has effectively destroyed my life. It's meant that, at the age of 56, I'm going to be homeless,\" he said.\n\nMichelle Mone and Doug Barrowman were interviewed by BBC's Laura Kuenssberg last month\n\nAML clients were then sent letters recommending they contact a third company, called Vanquish Options.\n\nVanquish was offering another scheme that would supposedly make the individual's loan charge problem go away, if customers paid a large fee to swap their existing loan for another loan.\n\nThe company was giving people advice that this transaction would square them with the tax authorities.\n\nTax Policy Associates, which conducted an investigation into the practice, has shared a letter with BBC News. It was sent to someone who signed up to the Vanquish scheme in April 2019.\n\nThe letter was intended to be sent to HMRC by the individual to explain why they were no longer liable for a loan charge. In it, the customer would claim they now had \"no outstanding liability\".\n\nTax experts believe this document provides grounds to investigate whether Vanquish Options was engaged in fraud towards HMRC.\n\nIt is unclear what, if any, Barrowman's involvement in the potential fraudulent letters was, but he has defended the lawfulness of the scheme in his response to the BBC.\n\nHowever, Ray McCann, a former president of the Chartered Institute of Taxation and a former HM Inspector of Taxes, told the BBC: \"I think there's undoubtedly enough for HMRC to justify opening a criminal investigation.\"\n\nMr Barrowman has previously denied any involvement in Vanquish.\n\nIn 2019, a spokesman told the Times newspaper he had \"no involvement or interest in Vanquish Options\". In 2020, Mr Barrowman's lawyers told the BBC he had not \"at any time owned or controlled Vanquish\".\n\nHowever, an analysis of the emails sent to people from Vanquish and from Mr Barrowman's AML business shows they share the same IP address - a unique label that identifies a device on the internet or a local network - in the Isle of Man, where his business operations are based.\n\nBBC News has also found AML and Vanquish shared some of the same directors, including a man called Arthur Lancaster.\n\nMr Lancaster, a long-time business partner of Mr Barrowman, has since been appointed director of PPE Medpro, which was awarded contracts worth more than £200m to supply PPE to the NHS.\n\nAs well as the National Crime Agency investigation, the firm is also being sued by the government for breach of contract.\n\nIn a", "continuation": " recent BBC interview, Mr Barrowman and his wife Baroness Mone admitted intentionally misleading the press over their connection to PPE Medpro.\n\nAs well as Mr Lancaster, the investigation into Vanquish's directors also found they included Timothy Eve and Paul Ruocco - two close business associates of Mr Barrowman.\n\nLawyers for Mr Barrowman's Knox Group denied \"any and all allegations of dishonesty, misconduct and wrongdoing\".\n\nIn a statement, it said HMRC was \"properly notified\" of the schemes and that there had been \"extensive dialogue and disclosure\" with tax authorities for \"several years\".\n\nDuring this time, it said HMRC had \"never even suggested, let alone alleged, that there has been any form of dishonesty or wrongdoing by the Knox Group\".\n\nKnox Group \"deeply and sincerely\" regretted the distress and anguish arising from the HMRC loan charge, which it blamed on \"retrospective\" and \"retroactive\" legal action from the government.\n\nHowever, Dan Neidle, founder of Tax Policy Associates, told BBC News that it would send a \"deeply corrosive\" message if HMRC did not take action against these companies connected to Mr Barrowman in light of the new evidence.\n\n\"It means that you can ignore tax law. You can make up tax schemes that have no prospect of working. You can sell them to people, extract large amounts of money from people, and then when it all goes wrong, you can just walk away, hide in an offshore island.\"\n\nAn HMRC spokesperson said: \"We collect the tax due under the law, creating a level playing field for everyone and funding public services. We are determined to drive promoters of tax avoidance out of business. We neither confirm nor deny investigations and cannot comment on identifiable individuals or businesses.\"\n\nMr Lancaster did not respond to BBC request for comment.\n\nAdditional reporting by Will Dahlgreen, BBC Verify data journalist, and Sean Clare, BBC Newsnight producer\n\nWatch the full investigation on BBC Newsnight on BBC2 at 22:30 GMT and on BBC iPlayer."}
{"context": "After 50 years of Assad cruelty, Syrians search for dead loved ones - and closure\n\nSyrians have come to the hospital in Damascus looking to find missing loved ones\n\nOn a painted wall outside Damascus's Mustahed Hospital are photographs of the faces of dead men. A constantly changing crowd of people examine them, squinting against the low winter sun at men who look as if they died in great pain. Noses, mouths and eye sockets are twisted, damaged and squashed. Their bodies are in the hospital, brought to the city centre from another on the outskirts of Damascus. The medics say the dead were all prisoners. A stream of wives, brothers, sisters and fathers come to the hospital looking for information. They're hoping most of all to find a body to bury. They get as close as possible to the photos looking hard for anything on the faces that they recognise. Some of them video each picture to take home for a second opinion. It is a brutal job. A few of the men had been dead for weeks judging by the way faces have decomposed. From the wall of photos, relatives go on to the mortuary.\n\nA woman outside Mustahed Hospital shows us the man she is looking for\n\nMustahed Hospital received 35 bodies, so many that the mortuary is full and the overflow room packed with trolleys loaded with body bags. Inside the mortuary, bodies were laid out on a bare concrete floor under a line of refrigerated trays. Body bags had been opened as families peered inside and opened the refrigerators. Some corpses were wrapped loosely in shrouds that had fallen away to expose faces, or tattoos or scars that could identify someone. One of the dead men was wearing a diaper. Another had sticky tape across his chest, scrawled with a number. Even as they killed him, his jailors denied him the dignity of his own name. All the bodies were emaciated. The doctors who examined them said they had signs of beating including severe bruising and multiple fractures. Dr Raghad Attar, a forensic dentist, was checking dental records left by families to try to identify bodies. She spoke calmly about how she was assembling a bank of evidence that could be used for DNA tests, then broke down when I asked her how she was coping. \"You hear always that prisoners are lost for a long time, but seeing it is very painful. \"I came here yesterday. It was very difficult for me. We hope the future will be better but this is very hard. I am really sorry for these families. I am very sorry for them.\" Tears rolled down her face when I asked her if Syria could recover from 50 years of the Assads. \"I don't know. I hope so. I have the feeling that good days are coming but I want to ask all countries to help us.\" \"Anything to help us. Anything, anything…\" The families and friends coming in went silently from body to body, hoping to find some end to the pain that started when their loved ones were picked up at one of the regime's checkpoints or in a raid on their homes and thrown into the Assads' gulag. A woman called Noor, holding a facemask over her mouth and nose, said her brother was taken in 2012, when he was 28. All they had heard since was a mention in a Facebook post that he had been in the notorious Sednaya prison, where the regime left prisoners to rot for decades. \"It is painful,\" said Noor. \"At the same time, we have hope. Even if we find him between the bodies. Anything so long as he's not missing. We want to find something of him. We want to know what happened to him. We need an end to this.\"\n\nOne couple told a doctor their son was hauled away for refusing to open his laptop for inspection. That was 12 years ago. He hasn't been heard from since. During the years I have reported from Syria I have heard many similar stories. On my phone I have a photo of the haunted face of a woman I met in July 2018 at a camp for people displaced just after the rebel stronghold of Douma in the Damascus suburbs was forced to surrender. Her son, a young teenager, disappeared after he was taken at a checkpoint by one of the intelligence agencies. More than 50 years of the Assads means 50 years of disappearances, of incarceration, of killing. It means pitiless cruelty to the prisoners, to the families trying to find them and to the Syrian people who were outside the Assads' circle of trust. At the photo wall and in the mortuary at Mustahed hospital they wanted to find what had happened, some information and if they were very lucky, a body. They needed a reckoning and many wanted revenge. Most of all, they dreamed and hoped for a life without fear.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Jeremy Bowen: Assad's palace, once a symbol of power, now an empty shell\n\nA woman at the hospital said that even though she knew Bashar al-Assad was in Russia, the regime had drilled so much fear into her that she was still terrified of what it might do. Maybe every Syrian who feels like her should go to the crag overlooking Damascus where Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father, ordered the construction of a presidential palace, to check that the monumental, marble edifice is empty. Our driver gathered his own video evidence. He took out his phone to start filming when the car turned into the palace's long ceremonial driveway. During the years of the regime, ordinary Syrians made sure they did not slow down near the palace gates in case they were arrested and thrown into prison as a threat to the president. Mobile phones stopped working as you approached the palace's security bubble. The palace looks down on Damascus, visible from most of the city. It told the people that the Assads were always present and always watching via the regime's web of intelligence agencies. The system was designed by Hafez, the first Assad president. His secret police spied on each other and spied on the people. A businessman I knew in Homs told me once that one intelligence branch approached him when he was developing a hotel, asking for the designs early in the project so they could incorporate all the listening devices they needed into the rooms. They explained it was easier than retrofitting them after the building was finished.\n\nThe Assad family never lived at the palace. It was for ceremonial occasions, and upstairs there were some workaday offices. I went there a lot in 2015, to negotiate the terms of an interview with Bashar al-Assad. I had interviewed him twice before, some years before the uprising against him started in 2011. That was when he was still tantalising Syrians with talk of reform, which turned out to be lies. He was also encouraging western leaders to believe he might be separated from Iran and if not join the western camp exactly, then be persuaded that it was worth his while not to oppose it. The US, Israel and the UAE were still trying to persuade him to dump Iran in the weeks before he was forced to flee to Moscow. Now that Assad has gone, my target at the palace was an opulent villa in the grounds. I wanted to go there because it was where I met Assad for the interviews. The villa, much more luxurious than the state rooms at the palace, was built, I was told, as a private residence for the Assad family. Its floors and tables are marble, the wood is polished walnut and the chandeliers are crystal. The Assads did not like it, so it was used as a guest house and for Bashar's rare interviews. I could see why they might have preferred their existing residence, a beautiful French colonial mansion that stands behind a screen of pine trees. It feels like an aristocrat's retreat on the Riviera. Until less than two weeks ago in the souk in o", "continuation": "ld Damascus you could buy fridge magnets of Bashar al-Assad and his siblings as children, playing on bikes in a garden as their indulgent parents looked on. Presumably the photo was taken on the villa's spacious, immaculate lawns.\n\nThe presidential palace looks down on Damascus, visible from most of the city\n\nThe extended Assad family treated Syria as their own personal possession, enriching themselves and buying trust with their followers at the expense of Syrians who could be thrown into jail or killed if they stepped out of line, or even if they didn't. A fighter called Ahmed, who had taken up arms against the regime in 2011, survived the rebel defeat in Damascus, and fought his way back from Idlib with the rebels of Hayat Tahrir al Sham was inspecting the way the Assads lived with his three brothers, all rebel fighters. \"People were living in hell and he was in his palace,\" Ahmed said calmly. \"He didn't care about what they were going through. He made them live in fear, hunger and humiliation. Even after we entered Damascus people would only whisper to us, because they were still afraid.\" I found the marble guesthouse, and walked through the walnut-panelled, marble-floored library where I had interviewed Assad when the regime was fighting for survival in February 2015. The highlight of the interview were his denials that his forces were killing civilians. He even tried to joke about it. Now, rebel fighters were on the door and patrolling the corridors. Some of the books had fallen off the library shelves, but the building was intact. I walked across to an ante room where Assad would grant 10 or 15 minutes of private conversation before the interview. He was unfailingly polite, even solicitous, enquiring about my family, and the journey to Syria. Bashar al-Assad's slightly awkward demeanour made some western observers believe he was a lightweight who might bend to pressure. In private I found him self-confident to the point of arrogance, convinced he was the all-knowing spider at the heart of the Middle East web, tracking his enemies' malign intentions and ready to strike. His father Hafez al-Assad was a kingpin of the Middle East. He was a ruthless man who built the police state that lasted for over fifty years, using fear, guile and a willingness to destroy any threat to impose stability on Syria, a country that had been a byword for violent changes of government until he seized sole power in 1970. I had the impression that Bashar wanted to be his father's son, perhaps even to outdo him. He killed many more Syrians than Hafez and broke the country to try to save the regime. But Bashar's stubbornness, refusal to reform or negotiate and his willingness to kill sealed his fate and condemned him to a last terrified drive to the airport with his wife and children on their last flight out of Syria to Moscow.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nIn a scruffy, bustling neighbourhood not far from the grace and beauty of the old city of Damascus, I had a front row seat as some of the pressures facing Syria and its new rulers surged through an excited crowd. They had heard that the man who until less than a week ago was the local boss, the mafia-style godfather of their suburb was going to be executed. The man, known as Abu Muntaja, was one of the military intelligence officers considered responsible for the Tadamon massacre in 2013 of at least 41 local men. The crowd grew until thousands blocked the streets, delighted that a notorious regime killer was going to be executed in in front of them in the main square that he used to swagger across. The atmosphere throbbed with excitement, expectation and anger. Justice meant watching their enemy die, not just because of his crimes, but because of the boundless cruelty of the Assad regime. An elderly women called Muna Sakar, dressed in a neat coat and hat, was there to see him die as a thief as well as a killer. \"He stole my house and money. Of course I want to see him dead. I would have done it myself with my own hands. But I couldn't find a way. I wanted to kill him.\" When rumours flew around that the execution was starting, the crowd surged back and forth, jostling for the best position, phones held high in outstretched arms for the video.

In the end there was no execution, at least not yet. It was probably a rumour, that thousands wanted to be true.

{"context": "Porridge and crumpets included in new junk food ad ban\n\nCertain types of porridge with added sugar are classified as \"junk food\" under the ban – though porridge products with no added sugar, salt or fat are exempt.\n\nCertain types of porridge, crumpets and breakfast cereals are included in a list of products that fall under a new junk food advertising ban. The government says the legislation, which applies to both paid online adverts and TV adverts shown before 21:00, is designed to curb childhood obesity. Due to come into force in October 2025, food classed by the government as \"less healthy\" falls under the ban, and includes fast food, soft drinks and ready meals as well as pastries, cereal bars and sweetened yoghurts. Cook and TV presenter Thomasina Miers welcomed the move as \"bold\" but the ban has prompted criticism from others.\n\nDetails of the restrictions show baked goods including crumpets, scones and pancakes are all considered junk food under the new legislation. Adverts for sugary breakfast cereals will also disappear from pre-watershed television screens, with granola, muesli and \"porridge oats, including instant porridge and other hot oat-based cereals\" all classed as \"less healthy\" food. The promotion of sweetened yoghurts and sugary drinks – including fizzy drinks and some fruit juices – will also be restricted. The government will classify products according to a scoring system based on their sugar, fat and protein content, banning advertising on all foods designated as \"less healthy\". This means healthy versions of products – including porridge products with no added sugar, salt or fat, and unsweetened yoghurt products – will not be subject to the ban. As well as TV advertising, the new legislation applies to paid-for online ads for these products to reduce children's exposure to foods high in fat, sugar or salt. The legislation comes in the context of rising childhood obesity levels in the UK, with NHS data suggesting almost one in 10 reception-aged children (9.2%) lives with obesity. One in five children by the age of five (23.7%) suffers tooth decay because of excess sugar consumption, NHS figures indicate. Former prime minister Boris Johnson first announced a UK-wide ban on TV adverts for food high in sugar, salt and fat before 21:00 to help tackle the problem in 2021. The ban was later delayed to 2025, with the Conservative government saying it wanted to give the food and drink industry time to prepare for the change because of the cost of living crisis.\n\nHealth secretary Wes Streeting says the advertising ban will \"deliver a major shift in the focus of healthcare from sickness to prevention.\"\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, cook and Wahaca restaurant chain co-founder Ms Miers welcomed the advertising ban. \"The government is taking very concerted, bold, and very brave action against big food [companies] who have a complete control of our food environment,” she said. Ms Miers said the ban would reduce the strain on taxpayers, pointing to research by Professor Tim Jackson, external for the Food Farming and Countryside Commission suggesting food-related chronic disease costs the UK £268bn a year. \"We’ve got the worst diet in Europe and we know it’s causing us absolute pain, discomfort, long-term sickness, early death, preventable death. It’s bringing the NHS to its knees”, she said. Ms Miers said the \"proposed legislation doesn’t go far enough\" and urged the government to do more to tackle poor diets. The government has said its legislation will prevent thousands of cases of childhood obesity each year, and is expected to remove 7.2 billion calories annually from UK children's diets. But for Prasanna Callaghan, who runs Crumpets café near Buckingham Palace, the proposed advertising ban on baked goods is \"bonkers.\" \"The world's gone mad\", he told BBC News, arguing the government legislation should draw a clearer distinction between crumpets and more traditional junk food like fried chicken. \"If you categorise crumpets as a junk food that will have a great impact on my business – basically what they're saying is: 'you shouldn't eat crumpets', indirectly.\"\n\nCrumpets are among the foods that would fall under the government's proposed junk food advertising ban\n\nMeanwhile, mother-of-two Maria McCracken from Ashford, Kent, said she disagreed with the advertising ban, instead stressing the importance of teaching children to eat healthy, balanced diets. Ms McCracken told the BBC she \"cooked pretty much everything from scratch\" for her children when they were growing up, but added that they enjoyed \"the occasional takeaway\" together. She said children should be shown how to cook nutritious meals for themselves. \"That really has to happen within the family, not the government banning something before nine o'clock,\" she said. The Slimming World consultant also questioned whether the TV adver", "continuation": "tising ban would effectively counter childhood obesity. \"Are [children] influenced by the adverts? I don't think they pay attention ever.\" The government's impact assessment on the legislation notes that \"overall the studies do find a clear link between food advertising and calorie consumption\". Former Conservative MP Paul Bristow told the BBC he was concerned the new guidance was too broad and included \"perfectly healthy\" foods. “The government needs to get out of people’s lives and trust people to make their own decisions. They certainly shouldn’t say to people how many bowls of porridge they can eat of a morning,\" the former Health and Social Care Committee member said. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the policy was \"the first step to deliver a major shift in the focus of healthcare from sickness to prevention, and towards meeting our government's ambition to give every child a healthy, happy start to life.\""}
{"context": "Tartous naval facility has been a key projection of Russian naval power in the region\n\nRussian naval vessels appear to have temporarily left their main port in Syria, satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show, amid continuing uncertainty about Moscow's military future in the country after the fall of its ally, Bashar al-Assad. Images taken by Maxar on 10 December show some ships have left Tartous naval base since Sunday and are currently sitting offshore in the Mediterranean Sea. Meanwhile, other photos taken on the same day show activity continuing at Russia's main airbase in Syria, Hmeimim, with jets clearly visible on the tarmac. On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would enter talks with incoming authorities about Russia's future military presence.\n\n\"Everything possible is now being done to get in touch with those involved in ensuring security and, of course, our military is also taking all the necessary precautions,\" he told reporters in Moscow. He previously warned that it was \"premature\" to speculate on the bases' future. \"You know that, of course, we maintain contacts with those who control the situation in Syria now. This is necessary because we have our bases there and our diplomatic office [embassy]. And of course, ensuring the safety and security of our facilities are of utmost importance,\" he told reporters. The Tartous naval facility houses elements of the Black Sea Fleet and is Russia's only repair and replenishment hub in the Mediterranean. Established by the Soviet Union in the 1970s, it was expanded and modernised by Russia in 2012 as the Kremlin began to increase its support for President Assad's regime. It allows Russian vessels to remain in the Mediterranean without having to return to ports in the Black Sea via the Turkish Straits. It is also a deep-water port, meaning it can host submarines from Moscow's nuclear fleet, according to the US Naval Institute.\n\nThe new satellite images show Moscow has at least temporarily brought its ships out of the port, with two guided missile frigates moored about 13km (eight miles) off the Syrian coast. It is unclear where the remainder of the fleet - pictured in earlier images - currently is. It is also unclear whether their departure is part of a permanent withdrawal from Tartous. In recent weeks, satellite images have repeatedly shown naval vessels coming and going from the port. Mike Plunkett from the open-source defence intelligence analysts at Janes organisation noted that the Russian movements appeared to have been \"conducted to ensure that their ships are not vulnerable to attack\". \"Whether they are worried about attack from the Syrian rebels or collateral damage from any Israeli strike on Syrian assets in Tartus is unknown,\" he added.\n\nFrederik Van Lokeren, a former Belgian navy lieutenant and analyst, told BBC Verify that it appeared the Russian vessels were now in a holding pattern while Moscow deliberated on its next move. \"They're effectively in limbo at the moment, because they don't quite know what's going to happen,\" Mr Van Lokeren said. \"Obviously, since they're lingering there, it seems that Russia is not willing to withdraw all its naval vessels out of the area just yet, which might be an indication that they're negotiating with regional partners to see where they can redeploy these vessels.\" Analysts have speculated that if Russia is forced to close the Tartous naval facility, it could redeploy its presence to Tobruk in Libya. The region is controlled by the Kremlin-backed Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar and already hosts some Russian airbases. But withdrawing from Tartous would be immensely costly, and Mr Van Lokeren noted that the move would also bring Russian vessels closer to Nato bases, making them easier to track. For now, he said, there is no indication that Russia is moving the necessary naval assets to remove equipment from Tartous.\n• None Syria's new transitional PM calls for stability and calm Meanwhile, since 2015 the Hmeimim air base has been a key part of Russia's operations across the Middle East and Africa. It has been used to launch devastating air strikes on cities across Syria in support of the Assad regime, while also using it to fly military contractors to Africa. Satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify showed at least two large jets - identified by Janes as IL-76 transport aircraft - still sitting on the tarmac at the base on 10 December. Helicopters could also be seen at the base in the images. Janes also notes that air defence systems deployed at the site remain visible in the north-western corner of the image.\n\nDara Massicot, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said on X on Sunday that an evacuation of the airbase would involve a massive airlift requiring far more jets than those visible in the satellite images, suggesting that Moscow does not plan to evacuat", "continuation": "e imminently. \"When Russian forces deployed to Syria in 2015, they flew almost 300 sorties in two weeks, and that was before base expansion,\" she wrote on X. \"A change signifying a major evacuation will be clear,\" she added. Despite the current holding pattern Russian forces appear to be displaying, the fall of the Assad regime represents a major blow to the Kremlin's ambitions in the region. During a 2017 visit to Khmeimim air base, President Vladimir Putin made clear that he intended for Moscow's presence to be a long-term project. Reflecting on the situation, an influential pro-Kremlin military blogger Rybar warned on Telegram that Russia's power-projection exercise in the region was in serious danger. \"Russia's military presence in the Middle East region is hanging by a thread,\" he concluded."}

With both a personal best and season's best time more than three seconds faster than anyone else in the final, she could hardly have lined up as a stronger favourite to defend her European crown. While she did not win by the margin perhaps expected - having run a world-leading time of 1:55.78 to beat world champion Mary Moraa in Eugene this year - Hodgkinson always appeared in control as she collected the eighth major medal of an already stunning senior career, which only started in 2021. The supremely talented Briton has been pushing the world's best since contesting her first major championships at the Tokyo Olympics. Following that stunning breakthrough silver at those Games three years ago and successive world silvers since, Hodgkinson's eyes are now fixed on gold in Paris, where she is once again expected to battle Moraa and American Olympic champion Athing Mu for global supremacy. \"I’m super excited for Paris. The next seven weeks are going to be incredible,\" Hodgkinson said. \"I do believe in the power of manifestation, so it’s obviously something I think about. The Olympic Games are so special, it's a huge opportunity to change your life and I’m just ready to go for it.\" Slovakia's Gabriela Gajanova took silver in 1:58.79 and France's Anais Bourgoin was third in 1:59.30.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

As the only athlete to clear 5.92m, Duplantis registered a first-time clearance at 5.97m, and again at 6.10m to win the 'Golden Crown' - awarded to those who produced standout performances in the Italian capital, along with 50,000 euros (£42,000). With the prize money secure, the bar was lifted to 6.25m as Duplantis took his latest three attempts at breaking the world record for a ninth time, but it was not to be on this occasion. Ingebrigtsen completed a third successive European golden double as he added the 1500m title to the 5,000m crown he successfully defended on Saturday.

{"context": "Airports have criticised the government’s sudden re-introduction of 100ml limits on liquids in hand luggage last weekend. The Airport Operators Association (AOA) said it had left airports \"frustrated\" and created uncertainty and confusion for passengers as the busiest time of year approached. After installing high-tech new scanning equipment, some regional airports had scrapped liquid restrictions. Major hubs had not yet switched to the new rules, but are rolling out the machines. The transport secretary has insisted the re-imposition of the old limits is \"temporary’\" but it’s unclear how long the situation will last.\n\nThe government requires all UK airports to upgrade to \"next generation\" security. New scanners which produce 3D images should mean liquids up to two litres and laptops can be kept in hand luggage to go through security. The likes of Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester were allowed to miss the latest deadline for installing them – 1 June this year - after various logistical challenges. However London City, Teesside, Newcastle, Leeds-Bradford, Aberdeen and Southend had complied on time and dropped the old liquids rules – some as early as Spring last year. Birmingham completed its installation but was told to keep the 100ml limit while waiting for regulatory approval. But on F", "continuation": "riday, an unexpected announcement from the Department for Transport (DfT) said that from Sunday, liquids, gels and pastes could once again only be taken through airport security in containers of 100ml or less. At the time, the DfT said it was not in response to a specific threat, but \"to enable further improvements to be made to the new checkpoint systems\". The BBC understands the government department felt it had to move quickly after receiving some new information about the scanners, is working with international partners, and will lift the restrictions once the issue has been resolved. The sudden change caused consternation among airport bosses, who were only informed on the Friday.\n\nKaren Dee, chief executive of trade body the Airport Operators Association, said hundreds of millions of pounds were being spent on a \"huge\" programme of change, as instructed by the government. She said airports supported decisions on security, but Friday’s \"surprise\" announcement \"was sprung on us with very little time to react\", and this \"created uncertainty for passengers just as airports enter their busiest periods of the year\". \"It has also put airport operators in a challenging position, with very limited time to prepare for the additional staffing and wider resources that this will require, and no clear idea of when this issue will be resolved.\" Airports who had fully switched the new systems and have trained and rostered their staff accordingly, are most affected, unable to use the expensive, new equipment to its full potential. The change is understood to have led to more items being rejected or confiscated as passengers have turned up expecting to be allowed to take larger containers through. Some larger airports who were only part way through their roll-outs had been using the new scanners in some areas so have also had to quickly alter ways of working. Thirty airport bosses, along with the AOA, have jointly written to the transport secretary, aviation minister and civil servants today in response to Friday’s announcement. Among the questions they want answering are how the decision was taken, what it means for airports who are part-way through their roll-out - with implications for staff training programmes - and how long the reversion to the 100ml limit will last. Ms Dee said airports were doing all they could to mitigate the impact. She asked passengers to come prepared to comply with the liquid limit until advised otherwise. A DfT spokesperson said Friday’s announcement only affected people travelling from six regional airports where Next Generation Security Checkpoints (NGSC) were already in full operation, which it said was around 6% of all UK air passengers. They added security measures would remain unchanged from those in place since 2006 for most passengers, and travellers should continue to check security requirements with their departure airport. The department said it had communicated with airports swiftly upon receiving new information."}
{"context": "Marizanne Kapp ripped through England's top order to set South Africa on their way\n\nEngland were beaten by six wickets after a below-par showing in the first one-day international against South Africa. Chasing 187 in scorching conditions in Kimberley, Proteas captain Laura Wolvaardt anchored the innings with a gritty unbeaten 59 from 114 balls to reach the target with 11.4 overs to spare. England's bowlers toiled, but were left to rue dropping Wolvaardt on five an", "continuation": "d 27 as the opener held the innings together before Nadine de Klerk's lively 48 not out from 28 balls secured the victory in style. While the surface was tricky and offered plenty of uneven bounce, England's batters were wasteful in being dismissed for 186 in 38.4 overs. Number eight Charlie Dean rescued the innings with 47 not out after England collapsed to 106-7, adding 67 for the eighth wicket with Sophie Ecclestone. South Africa were boosted by the return of all-rounder Marizanne Kapp, who was rested for the preceding T20 series and delivered a new-ball masterclass to take England's first three wickets. Sophia Dunkley was a late inclusion at the top of the order after Maia Bouchier injured her neck in the warm-up, and was caught behind for four before Tammy Beaumont was bowled for 11 and Nat Sciver-Brunt was lbw for a duck. Heather Knight's 40 led a brief revival before it was left to Dean and Ecclestone to show some resistance, with Dean matching her career-best score after her partner was brilliantly caught by De Klerk for 17. South Africa's batters also struggled to score fluently, but they withstood the threat of spinner Ecclestone by playing cautiously through her miserly spell of 0-29, and Wolvaardt's willingness to grind out the runs proved the difference. The second of three ODIs takes place in Durban on Sunday.\n\nEngland dominated the preceding T20 series but were below-par in their first ODI since September\n\nHaving been so dominant in the T20 series against a depleted South Africa, England were always going to face a a tougher assignment in the ODIs considering the returns of Kapp and seamer Ayabonga Khaka. Kapp showed her side exactly what they had missed with a relentless opening burst, swinging the ball prodigiously and rarely erring from a testing line and length that England's top order could not withstand. Dunkley wafted needlessly outside off stump, Beaumont walked down the pitch and played all around a straight one and Sciver-Brunt was trapped plumb lbw to her third delivery. After Danni Wyatt-Hodge was also pinned in front for 11 by De Klerk and Amy Jones was caught on the boundary for 21, Knight showed how to approach the slow surface, playing late and waiting for the loose ball. However, a shrewd review from South Africa led to England's captain being given out after a missed sweep, when there had barely been an appeal on the field. With England on 91-6, Wolvaardt appeared to miss a trick by overlooking Kapp, who still had six overs to go, and kept bowling her spinners because of the variable bounce. But Dean and Ecclestone looked at ease, happy to rotate the strike for the most sensible passage of play that England managed. South Africa were guilty of letting the game drift at times, but recovered to wrap up the tail promptly, with Dean left stranded short of her fifty.\n\nWolvaardt had a difficult T20 series but is the world's leading run-scorer in women's ODIs this year, and while this pitch did not allow her to play as fluently as usual, she gave a lesson to England's batters in application. Her 92-ball fifty is her slowest in ODIs but she was rarely under pressure thanks to the support of her batting partners, with Annerie Dercksen adding 27 to her 3-16 with the ball, Kapp scoring a run-a-ball 22 and De Klerk's attacking innings that included 11 fours. The concern for England, though, is their lack of creativity in this format. They squeezed Wolvaardt by bowling straight and cut off her favoured shots through the off side but she was equal to it, happy to block when necessary. When that did not work, they were out of options and, despite the pitch offering plenty of bounce for seamers Lauren Bell and Lauren Filer early, they were too inaccurate and could not benefit from its assistance like Kapp. The fielding remains a concern, too. Jones strangely went one-handed for the edge behind off Wolvaardt, and Dunkley put down a straightforward chance on the square leg boundary after the Proteas captain miscued a rare Ecclestone full toss. England are still finding their way back into ODIs after a feast of short-format cricket but, with the Ashes looming against world champions Australia, they need these to figure out a more successful formula in the remaining two matches here.\n\nPlayer of the Match, South Africa all-rounder Marizanne Kapp: \"The other bowlers who came on played their part too. It’s a positive win for us to take into the rest of the series.\" England captain Heather Knight: \"Obviously disappointed but we had some positives. The partnership between Charlie [Dean] and Sophie [Ecclestone] got us into the game but unfortunately it wasn't enough. \"We felt if we took a couple of wickets and we would be in with a chance. But Nadine [de Klerk] put in a brilliant innings and finished it off quickly.\" South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt: \"Marizanne Kapp makes such a difference to our side so it's great to have her back and glad to get the win. \"I was pleased with my 50. It was not my ideal innings but it is my role to stay there until the end so I’m glad I could do that.\"\n• None Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport"}
{"context": "A passenger's hand became trapped in the doors of an Elizabeth line train at Ealing Broadway station\n\nAn investigation has been launched after a passenger's hand became trapped in the closing doors of an Elizabeth line train as it was leaving London's Ealing Broadway station. The incident on 24 November saw the passenger having to run alongside the train before they were freed by a member of staff who was working on the platform. The driver was alerted to what was happening by other rail users, and the train stopped after moving approximately 17m (56 ft). The passenger reportedly suffered minor injuries. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said it would look into what happened. Transport for London (TfL) said it was sorry the customer \"experienced this distressing incident\".\n\nAmong the issues the RAIB said it would consider are the actions of those involved and the arrangements in place to manage and control the risks associated with passengers getting on and off Elizabeth line trains. A TfL spokesperson said the operator of the service, MTR-Elizabeth line, is currently carrying out a thorough investigation into the incident which happened just after midnight. The spokesperson said: \"We will always strive to learn from incidents and improve operational safety. \"MTR-Elizabeth line is fully co-operating with the RAIB to establish the root cause of this incident to determine what steps they can take to avoid any further events of this nature and to share learnings with the industry. \"While serious injuries on our network are rare, we are undertaking a huge range of work aimed eradicating such incidents and making travelling even safer for everyone.\" In June 2023 the RAIB investigated after two people were dragged along London Underground platforms by trains when their coats got stuck in the train doors. The incidents happened at Archway and Chalk Farm stations on the Northern line. The passenger at Archway was seriously injured after being dragged along the platform for about 2m (6.5ft) when their coat became trapped in the doors of a northbound Northern line train.\n\nIn 2023 a passenger was seriously injured when her coat got caught in the door\n\nIn its report into the incidents the RAIB recommended that London Underground should look at reducing the risk of a passenger becoming trapped and dragged along by a departing train. This could include technology that can detect when thin objects, such as fingers, straps or clothing, become trapped in train doors and when something is being dragged along by the departing train. It said Tube bosses should consider modifying door seals to make it easier for small, trapped objects, such as clothing and straps to be pulled free from closed doors. The board also said London Underground should review the current minimum automatic train dwell times to determine if passengers have sufficient time to safely get on or off trains. TfL told BBC London it is taking action to drive improvements to reduce risk in this area, including infrastructure changes, technology improvements, and more training for station colleagues and train operators. It added it is also developing plans to trial technology to help reduce risks and it is talking to other metros and rail operators in the UK and worldwide to share how they manage risks.\n\nConcerns have previously been raised about passenger safety on the Elizabeth line at Ealing Broadway due to the gap between the platform and the train. In July the mayor of London apologised to several Elizabeth line passengers who were seriously injured using trains at the station and said work", "continuation": " was being done to make sure the high gap would be fixed. Three passengers told BBC London they had been hurt using the service at Ealing Broadway station because the gap between the platform and trains is too big. Sadiq Khan said he was \"shocked\" to see reports on BBC London of those injured, adding: \"I'm really sorry. You should not be injured going about your daily business.\" At the time TfL and Network Rail both said they were \"sorry\" some passengers had sustained injuries and safety was their \"priority\".

Dennis Iliffe was initially refused a pay-out because wind speeds in his home town of Kidderminster only hit 53 mph.

ClimaMeter, external was put together by a team of weather researchers to tell the rest of us in plain language what role climate change played, by comparing measurements from similar storms in the past. For Storm Darragh, the scientists say climate change played a big role. The heavy rain and strong winds in Storm Darragh locally were \"strengthened by human-driven climate change\".

It considerably widens the gap between the parties in the first week of the official campaign, which stood at just under £352,000. Latest Electoral Commission filings also confirm former Neighbours actor Holly Valance donated £50,000 to Nigel Farage's Reform UK. The Australia-born former pop star, who sprang to fame in Britain with her 2002 hit Kiss Kiss and now lives in the UK, attended the press conference earlier this month where Mr Farage announced he would be standing as a candidate in the Essex seat of Clacton.\n\nThe figures mean the Conservatives raised £889,000 in the first two weeks of the official campaign, which began when Parliament was shut down on 30 May.

The £292,500 it raised in the latest reporting period was less than the £335,000 posted by the Liberal Democrats.

The location for the traditional Christmas Day broadcast is the Fitzrovia Chapel in central London, which once served as the chapel of the Middlesex Hospital. It's the first time in more than a decade that the Christmas speech has been recorded from a place that isn't in a royal palace or estate - and it's understood that the King wanted a location with a connection to those working in healthcare. The ornately-decorated 19th Century former chapel building is now used for exhibitions and community events for people of any faiths and none.\n\nThe Fitzrovia Chapel once served hospital staff and patients\n\nAs well as a connection to the health services, the building also ties in with the King's interest in building bridges between different beliefs, backgrounds and religions.

The traditional speech from the monarch, recorded earlier this month, will be broadcast as usual on television and radio at 15:00 on Christmas Day. The Christmas message comes at the end of a year in which the King faced a cancer diagnosis. His regular sessions of treatment are continuing, as they have for much of this year, but as a sign of a positive response, he has plans for a busy schedule of engagements and overseas trips in 2025. Setting the speech in this former hospital chapel, which was renovated and reopened in 2016, will be a reminder of the efforts of those working in the health services and medical research. The King has been filmed beside a Christmas tree, which has since been donated to a hospice in Clapham.\n\nThe King's message was filmed in a chapel that once served the Middlesex Hospital\n\nThe small chapel, decorated in the Gothic Revival style with shimmering mosaics and Byzantine influences, is tucked away in Pearson Square, in a quiet corner of London's West End. It was built in the courtyard of what was the Middlesex Hospital, serving its staff and patients. When the hospital was demolished the chapel was retained and restored, with a new development built around it. It's no longer regularly used for services, but is used for community events and concerts and is open to visitors wanting some quiet contemplation. The monarch's Christmas message has often been recorded in Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. But there have been exceptions, most recently in 2010 when it was filmed at Hampton Court Palace, and before that in 2006 at Southwark Cathedral. In 2003 the speech was recorded at an army barracks in Windsor. The run-up to Christmas has seen the King attending a series of seasonal events, including a Christmas market in Battersea, a service remembering those persecuted because of their religion and an event in Walthamstow celebrating the diversity of the local community. The King's speech on Christmas Day follows a tradition dating back to 1932, when George V made the first Christmas broadcast. That first speech was scripted by Rudyard Kipling, who lay in state in the Fitzrovia Chapel before his funeral in Westminster Abbey."}

Payne died in October after falling from the balcony of his hotel room in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He was 31. Kate Cassidy - who had been in a relationship with the One Direction star since 2022 - said: \"As the holidays are here, I realise it is a time for happiness and joy, but it is also a time of sadness and grief for so many.\" In an Instagram stories post, she said she was sending love to those \"carrying grief this holiday\" and called on people to be gentle with those experiencing grief over Christmas.\n\n\"The holidays can feel different for everyone,\" she says, and wishes everyone \"a love-filled and healthy holiday season this year.\". In October, Cassidy revealed on social media that Payne wrote a note to her shortly before his death predicting they would get married within a year. In her tribute to him after he died, she called Payne \"my best friend, the love of my life\" and said that she had \"lost the best part of myself\".\n\nPayne's sudden death led to an outpouring of grief from his family, friends and fans around the world. The Wolverhampton-born singer shot to fame when he auditioned for the X Factor in 2010 at the age of 16 and became part of One Direction. While the boy band went on to achieve phenomenal success across the globe, Payne himself acknowledged that it came at a cost and admitted that he used alcohol to cope with the band's increasing fame. His death prompted a debate about the duty of care in the music industry, particularly for young people. In November, Argentinian authorities confirmed that three people were charged in connection with the singer's death. Toxicology tests revealed traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his body. A post-mortem examination determined his cause of death as \"multiple trauma\" and \"internal and external haemorrhage\", as a result of the fall from the hotel balcony. According to the prosecutor's office, medical reports also suggested Payne may have fallen in a state of semi or total unconsciousness. Payne's funeral was held in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, last month and was attended by friends, family, and his One Direction bandmates."}

The Bear star tells the BBC about her experience stepping behind the scenes to direct episode six of the new season of The Bear. \"I had a total blast and I learnt so much from it,\" Edebiri, who plays sous chef Sydney, tells the BBC. \"I love our cast but being able to collaborate with them from a different vantage point gave me so much more appreciation for them but also appreciation for the sheer amount of effort it takes to make television. \"It really is such a powerful and beautiful machine,\" the 28-year-old gushes. The actress, who recently starred in Inside Out 2, has won a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild award, and an Emmy for her performance in the comedy-drama.\n\nCillian Muraphy and Ayo both made many red carpet appearances during awards season\n\nThe US star gained new fans after joking that she had played the infamous donkey in Martin McDonagh's 2022 film The Banshees of Inisherin. Edebiri made multiple references to \"her people\" in Ireland in winning speeches and red carpet interviews. The joke - throwaway as it was - took on a life of its own for Irish social media users, who flocked to claim Edebiri (or, at least, speculate that she may have as yet undiscovered Irish heritage). The episode she directs in The Bear is called Napkins and is all about Tina (Liza Colón-Zayas), one of the chefs at the Chicago restaurant. Colón-Zayas, 52, jokes that Edebiri was \"just OK\" at directing, before her co-star Lionel Boyce, who plays sensitive pastry chef Marcus, jumps in and says that the episode was his favourite of the season. \"It's so cool when you watch someone you know directing as you see her influence in the episode. \"Ayo had her own vision and I really want to see her direct more thing,\" he says.\n\nBoyce and Edebiri also praise Colón-Zayas for her acting skills. \"Directing Liza was amazing, I was telling her to do insane things and she just does it; I can see why she is everyone's favourite actor,\" Edebiri explains.\n• None ‘This is the real-life version of The Bear’\n• None Why The Bear star Ayo Edebiri is 'Ireland's own'\n• None Emmys 2024: Succession, The Bear and Beef among winners The show follows a young chef from the fine dining world, Carmy, as he returns to the family run sandwich shop in Chicago after his brother's suicide. In season two, Carmy and his team transform his brother's shop into a new restaurant: The Bear. After its successful opening, season three follows the chefs as they strive even harder for culinary excellence and the all important Michelin star.\n\nBut filming the latest season has come with certain additional pressures, that are probably akin to those faced in high-stake restaurant kitchens. \"There's always a first day of sc", "continuation": "hool nerves when you start filming a new series,\" explains Abby Elliott who plays Carmy's sister Sugar. At the 2024 Emmy Awards the show won six prizes, including three for acting, and drew top with Succession for the most awards. In her acceptance speech Edebiri told the audience: \"This is a show about found family and real family, and my parents are here tonight - thank you so much for loving me and letting me feel beautiful and black and proud of all of that.\" Earlier this year it also picked up the award for the best TV series at the Golden Globes.\n\nJeremy Allen White says he was \"grateful\" for all the awards the show has won\n\n\"There is this beautiful noise around the show that we are really grateful for,\" says lead actor Jeremy Allen White. \"But it's really special how once we get back to the restaurant in Chicago everything quietens down and we go back to the place where we shot the pilot. \"Back then no one knew or cared about the awards and there were no expectations - we were just making something that felt good for us. The rest of the cast agree. Boyce says: \"The pressure is suspended when we're filming\", while Edebiri says the actors have \"managed to recreate the same bubble that existed in previous seasons and just make it all about the work.\" Allen White also adds that \"there's something about the work environment when we're filming that actually matches the pace of what it's like in the kitchen, so there's always been an inherent pressure in how we make the show\".\n\nIt's no wonder then that Allen White doesn't find it too difficult to get into character. \"It's not hard for me to get stressed or worked up, it's actually quite accessible for me as I learn towards being a bit of an anxious person naturally,\" he tells the BBC. A stress inducing drama about a failing restaurant may not have immediately sounded like a hit, but the show has gained an impressive cult-like following. Edibiri says people love the show so much because it \"has its really intense moments but also lots of beautiful and ridiculous moments and as a human you know what that feels like\".\n\nEdebiri and Allen White say the show is \"incredibly relatable\"\n\nThe show was filmed as people came out of the pandemic, which, according to Edibiri, was a time when \"people were thinking a lot about work and what it means; like are you working in a job you're passionate about or with people you like.

{"context": "Items worth £25m were stolen from the west London mansion of Tamara Ecclestone\n\nA man accused of being involved in one of the biggest burglaries in English history has been charged in Serbia. According to Serbian court documents, Ljubomir Romanov invested money via \"criminal activities\" in the UK into luxury cars, real estate in Belgrade and other items to the value of €2.4m (£2m). It is understood the alleged money laundering offences are linked to the raids on the homes of three celebrities in December 2019 where £26m of valuables were taken. The largest came at the home of socialite and former model Tamara Ecclestone, where £25m worth of jewellery, cash and other items were stolen. Other homes burgled included one belonging to the former Chelsea and England footballer Frank Lampard, and the now-deceased former owner of Leicester City, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha.

Eight other defendants were named in Wednesday's indictment.\n\nIn November 2022, three Italians - Jugoslav Jovanovic, Alessandro Maltese and Alessandro Donati - were jailed for 28 years in total after pleading guilty to conspiracy to burgle. Isleworth Crown Court heard the gang targeted Ms Ecclestone's palatial London home on one of the most expensive streets in the world opposite Kensington Palace, which the Formula 1 heiress shares with her husband Jay Rutland. The couple had left for a Christmas holiday in Lapland hours earlier. Many of the rooms inside the mansion were cleared of valuables. In just over an hour, the burglars made off with 400 items of jewellery and large sums of cash. After the convictions an international hunt was launched by the Metropolitan Police for a fourth suspect known to the force as Daniel Vukovic. A BBC investigation found authorities in Italy, Serbia and the UK had linked him to other alleged burglaries across Europe. He is believed to have used at least 19 identities - including Ljubomir Romanov, which is the name the Serbian Public Prosecutor’s Office for Organised Crime have charged him under following his arrest in December 2023 in Belgrade.\n\nThe other defendants on the indictment are Milka Radosavljevic, Entoni Radosavljevic, Irena Radosavljevic, Laura Radosavljevic, Mirka Nikolic, Biljana Radosavljevic, Robert Konovalov, and Kristijan Jovanovic. They are all charged with conspiring to commit criminal acts, money laundering and coercing into verifying false content, the prosecutor's office said. A statement said Mr Romanov and Mr Konovalov - whose offences are linked to Switzerland - purchased \"large quantities of luxury real estate\" as well as \"large quantities of luxury vehicles or other movables\". Prosecutors added the defendants invested \"illegal money into legal cash flows in the amount of at least €2,422,255\". Following their arrests, officials blocked the accounts, the use of real estate and seized luxury cars, prosecutors said.\n\nThere is no indication at this stage that UK authorities have renewed their extradition request. An extradition treaty agreement signed by Serbia and the UK in December 1900 says each country can deny extradition of its own citizens.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser."}

Eleven men and two juveniles were arrested, including the vessel's crew and others waiting on the shore to collect the illegal shipment. The drugs had an estimated street value of A$760m ($490m; £388m), with the potential to be distributed across 11.7 million separate street deals - making it the largest cocaine bust in Australian history.

{"context": "Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, pictured here in 2019\n\nVladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un have а lot in common. Neither gets out much. The Kremlin leader hasn't left Russia this year. In Kim's case, make that four years. Both Russia and North Korea have been accused of becoming \"rogue states\". Both are under heavy international sanctions. Both governments rail against the \"hegemony\" of the United States. Often a common enemy can bring leaders closer together. And so it is with Putin and Kim. Theirs is a marriage made, if not in heaven, then certainly in the geo-political realities of 2023. A bromance? Not exactly. Unlike former US President Donald Trump, who once declared that he and Kim Jong Un \"fell in love\", the leaders of Russia and North Korea are less effusive in their public displays of affection. But both Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un see potential benefits from a closer relationship.\n\nSo, what's in it for the Kremlin? For a start, North Korea has a huge defence industry with large-scale production capabilities. With Russia's war in Ukraine grinding on, Pyongyang could prove an invaluable source of munitions for Moscow. Wa", "continuation": "shington suspects the Kremlin has already clocked that. The United States claims that arms talks between Russia and North Korea have been \"actively advancing\" with Russia allegedly seeking supplies of ammunition and artillery shells. No confirmation of that from Russian officials. But plenty of unsubtle hints that Russia and North Korea intend to boost military co-operation. Back in July Sergei Shoigu became the first Russian defence minister to visit North Korea since the break-up of the Soviet Union, when he attended events marking the 70th anniversary of the Korean armistice. Kim Jong Un played tour guide as he showed Mr Shoigu around a weapons exhibition. The defence minister has also hinted that joint military exercises are in the pipeline. \"If they are looking for weaponry in North Korea, one of the poorest and less developed countries of the world - an isolated country - to my mind that is the utmost humiliation of the propaganda of Russian 'great power',\" believes former Russian foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev. Mr Kozyrev was speaking to me in a video call from the United States where he currently resides. \"A great power would not go to North Korea for an alliance or military supplies.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Why might North Korea and Russia want to be friends?\n\nBut a power intent on overturning the world order might. With his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin signalled his determination to remake the global order to Russia's liking. Military co-operation with North Korea may be another sign of that. An arms deal between Moscow and Pyongyang would represent quite a shift. Until recently Russia had been four-square behind UN Security Council sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons programme. Among other things, those sanctions ban the trade of weapons with North Korea. \"Moscow had put its signature to those Security Council resolutions,\" Russian tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets reminded readers last week. But it added: \"Never mind. A signature can be revoked.\" The paper quoted the chairman of Russia's Council on Foreign and Defence Policy Fyodor Lukyanov as saying: \"For a long time now the question's been asked: why are we [Russia] abiding by these sanctions? The whole system of international relations is in a state of total pandemonium. \"Of course, the UN sanctions are legitimate. It's hard to deny that. We voted for them. But the situation has changed. Why not revoke our vote?\" That would be music to Kim Jong Un's ears.\n\nWhat else may North Korea be hoping to get from Russia? Almost certainly, humanitarian aid to help alleviate North Korea's food shortages. There's also speculation that Pyongyang has been seeking advanced Russian technology for satellites and military use, including for nuclear-powered submarines. More than a year and a half into a war that has gone badly wrong for Russia, Moscow may well need to replenish its munitions stocks. It may well see a deal with Pyongyang as a way of helping to achieve that. But that doesn't mean that, without North Korea's help, Russia's war machine is about to grind to a halt. \"Putin is not desperate,\" believes former foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev. \"He can sustain this for a very long time and he can adapt. He learns every day how to circumvent the sanctions, how to co-operate with China, with North Korea and some regimes in Africa. That is not an alternative for the future. But it is an alternative for the present time. And maybe for years to come.\""}
{"context": "The UK motor industry is being consulted over how the phasing-out of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 will work, the government has announced. The ban on sales of these vehicles had been extended to 2035 under the previous Conservative government but Labour said it would restore the 2030 deadline in its election manifesto. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander is now seeking views from automotive and charging experts to \"restore clarity\" on how to deliver the ban. Car industry leaders have warned drivers were not switching to electric vehicles at the rate needed to meet the deadline due to the cost of buying the cars privately and charging point infrastructure.\n\nLast month, Ford said the UK government's mandate to produce and sell more electric vehicles (EVs) \"just doesn't work\" without demand. Lisa Brankin, Ford UK's chair and managing director, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The one thing that we really need is government-backed incentives to urgently boost the uptake of electric vehicles.\" The Department for Transport said the consultation would \"restore clarity for vehicle manufacturers and the charging industry\" so they \"have the confidence to invest in the UK in the long term and drive growth in the UK automotive industry\".\n\nBut some say they are not yet sold on switching to EVs. Kaylan Evans from London said she wouldn't buy an electric car because \"the price point is crazy\". \"I don't like the element of relying on charging points and stations when the infrastructure isn't that set up at the moment,\" she added. She said she and her husband are sticking to their petrol car for now. Meanwhile, Angelina who is also from London says living in a block of flats there is not \"an option to charge\" vehicles there and wondered how having a personal electric point installed would affect electricity bills. She wants to move away from her diesel car because of \"the rising cost of fuel and the environmental issues\".\n\nThe government said the consultation would be part of a \"wider push\" to make it easier and cheaper to charge electric cars. There are now more than 72,000 public charging points in the UK, with another 100,000 planned by local authorities across England, according to the government. The lack of sufficient charging infrastructure, particularly in rural areas and homes without private parking spaces poses an issue as well - one that analysts will take several years to resolve. The cost of EVs remains a barrier to people switching as even the most affordable models are still pricier than their petrol or diesel counterparts. The government said EVs made up one in four cars sold in the UK. It said industry data put 1 in 3 used electric cars at under £20,000. Edmund King, president of the AA, said drivers have been \"hesitant about the transition but not hostile\" but the consultation would bring more clarity and certainty. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said it was \"imperative we get an urgent resolution\" to adapt the mandate to help car makers achieve it along with \"bold incentives\" to get drivers to buy electric vehicles. The consultation proposes updates to the Zero Emission Vehicle (Zev) mandate, which sets out the percentage of new zero emission cars and vans that manufacturers will be required to sell each year up to 2030. In 2024, EVs must make up 22% of a carmaker's car sales, and 10% of van sales. This target is set to rise. Firms failing to meet these targets face a £15,000 fine per sale. Companies can avoid fines by buying \"credits\" from firms that have exceeded their quotas for electric car sales. They can also \"borrow\" allowances from future years. The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) think tank said target required to be achieved by each manufacturer was due to be reached as an average across the industry because these credits would be taken into account. Colin Walker, transport lead at the ECIU added: \"Certain manufacturers are proving themselves not just equal but better to the task they've been set. The likes of BMW, Mercedes, Hyundai, for example. They are all selling more EV's than they need to. It's proof it can be done and that more ambitious targets in the years ahead can be hit.\"\n\nThe government's eight-week consultation aims to gather views on which cars can be sold alongside zero emission vehicles from 2030, including full hybrids and plug-in hybrids, as well as the strategy for vans and the policy for small volume manufacturers. More than two-thirds of car manufacturers in the UK, including Stellantis, have committed to transitioning fully to electric cars by 2030. However, firms have also announced thousands of job cuts, partly because of EV targets. UK car production experienced a sharp decline in October 2024, with overall output dropping by over 15% compared to the previous year. Automotive industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) attributed this fall to weak demand and a significant decrease in exports. Electric and hybrid vehicle production saw an even steeper decline, falling by one-third due to flagging European demand and factory retooling for new models. \"Today's measures will help us capitalise on the clean energy transition to support thousands of jobs, make the UK a clean energy superpower, and rebuild Britain,\" Alexander said. Dan Caesar, chief executive of Electric Vehicles UK said this was an opportunity to position the UK as \"on", "continuation": "e of the most attractive battery EV markets on the global stage.\" He said there was a growing demand for used and new batteries, and this roadmap would give manufacturers and users more clarity."}

When asked whether Musk was a threat to democracy, Clegg said the entrepreneur had been \"playing an outsized role\" in the US election and in the formation of the new Trump administration. He also stood by comments labelling Meta's social media rival, X, a \"one-man, hyper-partisan, ideological hobbyhorse\".\n\nThe former Liberal Democrat leader, who served as deputy PM to David Cameron in 2010's coalition government, swapped Westminster for Silicon Valley after losing his Sheffield Hallam seat to Labour in the 2017 general election. In 2022, he was promoted to a senior role by Zuckerberg, with responsibility for policy as well as communication and a reported bonus of £10m on top of his £2.7m annual salary. He has been the voice of Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, on a range of highly controversial issues since then. In his interview with Nick Robinson, he spoke about how his role was making judgements about how to balance freedom of expression with protecting audiences from harmful content on Meta. In contrast, Musk has spoken of his mission to \"remove all the censorship\" from X, with Clegg saying \"you can't move [on X]... for want of tripping over stuff from the person who now privately owns it\". When asked if Musk was \"a threat to democracy\", Clegg said: \"I think Elon Musk is obviously now playing an outsized role in both the election and now the formation of the new US administration. \"And I think it will see he has a choice - he can be either an avid and well-heeled supporter... Or he can try and become a sort of political…puppet master, going well beyond Trump, deciding who the next Republican candidate should be and the one after that, and so on, so forth.\" He added people were familiar with the former because \"people with means\" often get involved in politics, but the latter \"is is quite different to the general tradition of American democracy\". The former Lib Dem leader also highlighted the benefits of generative AI, mocking the idea the technology would \"turn us all into paperclips by next Tuesday\". He claimed fears that \"AI was going to destroy democracy\" were over-egged, particularly fears that democracy would \"up-ended by AI deep fakes\" in 2024, the year with the most elections around the world in history.

She says it is dark humour that will take the viewers on a rollercoaster.\n\nActress Karen Gillan hadn't worried about cancel culture until her latest role\n\n\"It starts off as this comedy workplace farcical TV show and then it takes a little bit of a turn and becomes much more of a drama that is tackling some serious subject matters. \"A big one is the abuse of power in the workplace. My character is someone who at the beginning seems really hard to read. People might describe her as manipulative or calculated. \"But then come episode three and four, you get to see see everything the character has been through just to survive the workplace. As it is for a lot of women in a lot of work environments.\"\n\nBeing \"cancelled\" is is a modern concept evolved from social media interactions. It has become a way to call on others to reject a person or business. This can happen when the target breaks social norms - for example, making sexist comments - but it has also happened when people have expressed opinions on politics, business and even pop culture. Karen - with 7.9m Instagram followers, and 1.3m on X - has never worried about it. \"To be honest, it's not one of my big fears. \"I am not going on social media thinking, 'God am I going to get cancelled?'. \"But I think that when we were making this, it definitely came into the forefront of my mind.\" And she revealed it's her loved ones who worry more. She says, \"One of my friends pulled me aside one day and said sometimes I just worry about the amount of social media followers you have. \"I said 'What? Why'. She was like it's just a lot of people watching what you are doing. \"That made me think should I be worried? But other than that I have not thought about it too much.\" She added: \"I have always tried to be authentic on social media and I am going to continue on that path but I think it's good to be be mindful of what you are saying.\"\n\nKaren Gillan is followed by millions on social media\n\nKaren said little research was required, but a couple of well-known faces may have provided some inspiration for Madeline. \"Luckily I've been on so many of those TV shows, that I feel my research had already been done,\" she said. \"I didn't base her on anyone but I did watch the Prince Andrew Newsnight interview to see how she [Emily Maitlis] delivered those types of questions. \"And one of my favourites is Susanna Reid on Good Morning Britain. I watch that every morning to try to cure my homesickness, and so maybe there is a little of her in there. \"\n\nAlex Kingston as River Song, Matt Smith as The Doctor and Karen Gillan as Amy Pond in Dr Who\n\nKaren shot to fame as Doctor Who companion Amy Pond in 2010, and has since become a major Hollywood player - appearing as Nebula in the Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy franchise and as Ruby Roundhouse in the reworked Jumanji films. Douglas Is Cancelled turned into a bit of a Doctor Who reunion. \"Writer Steven Moffat was showrunner while I was on Doctor Who. Alex Kingston played my daughter - time travel - and Hugh Bonneville was a pirate king in one of the episodes,\" she said. Karen is now based in LA with her comedian husband Nick Kocher - but returning to her family in Inverness is important to reset and escape the prying eyes of the world's media. \"Coming home feels like a step away from everything, it feels like reset and it's a way to reconnect with everything that its so far removed from all this stuff I am usually doing,\" she told BBC Scotland News. \"All my mates are still in Inverness so that's a huge part of coming home. There's a part of me that just wants to get a little cottage up in the Highlands and just do that for the rest of my life. \"But I married an American so I think that's ruined my plan.\""}

The school was set up in 1934 by the German educator Kurt Hahn, who was forced to leave his own country after criticising Hitler. Prince Philip was one of the first pupils there and retained a close link to the school for the rest of his life. His three sons - King Charles, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward - were sent there, as were Princess Anne's children, Peter and Zara Phillips.

Mr Yang claimed he was a victim of a \"political climate\" which had seen a rise in tensions between the UK and China. In a statement after a High Court judge lifted an order granting him anonymity, he said: \"Due to the high level of speculation and misreporting in the media and elsewhere, I have asked my legal team to disclose my identity. \"I have done nothing wrong or unlawful and the concerns raised by the Home Office against me are ill-founded. The widespread description of me as a 'spy' is entirely untrue.\" China's embassy in the UK previously denied the espionage claim saying \"some individuals in the UK are always eager to fabricate baseless 'spy' stories targeting China\". \"Their purpose is to smear China and disrupt normal exchanges between Chinese and British personnel,\" a spokesperson for the embassy said."}

{"context": "Campaigners have reacted with fury to what they call the government's \"unjustified\" rejection of compensation for women hit by changes to the state pension age. They say 3.6 million women born in the 1950s were not properly informed of the rise in state pension age to bring them into line with men. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall apologised for a 28-month delay in sending letters, but has rejected any kind of financial payouts. Nine months ago, a parliamentary ombudsman recommended compensation of between £1,000 and £2,950 for each of those affected.\n\nThe Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) campaign described the government's decision as an \"insult\". \"The government has today made an unprecedented political choice to ignore the clear recommendations of an independent watchdog,\" said Angela Madden, who chairs the campaign group. \"This is a bizarre and totally unjustified move which will leave everyone asking what the point of an ombudsman is if ministers can simply ignore their decisions.\" The Waspi campaign had called for payments of at least £10,000 each. But Kendall said there was evidence that there was \"considerable awareness\" of the changes to the pension age, and sending letters earlier would not have made a difference to their ability to make retirement choices. She also said that there was no evidence of \"direct financial loss\" resulting from the government's decision, and that Labour did not believe \"paying a flat rate to all women at a cost of up to £10.5bn would be fair or proportionate to taxpayers\". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he understood the Waspi women's concerns, but had to take into account whether it was right \"to impose a further burden on the taxpayer\". However, former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who pledged to compensate the women in the party's 2019 manifesto, told the BBC's Newsnight programme that the money would not have had to be paid in a year but over \"quite a long period of time\". \"These Waspi women... are actually taxpayers also, and they're people that have made an enormous contribution to our lives and society,\" he said.\n\nThe age at which people receive the state pension has been increasing as people live longer, and currently stands at 66 for men and women. But for decades, men had received their state pension at 65 and women at the age of 60. Under the 1995 Pensions Act a timetable was drawn up to equalise the age at which men and women could draw their state pension. The plan was to raise the qualifying age fo", "continuation": "r women to 65 and to phase in that change from 2010 to 2020. But the coalition government of 2010 decided to speed that up. Under the 2011 Pensions Act the new qualifying age of 65 for women was brought forward to 2018.\n\nThe increases have been controversial. Campaigners say women born in the 1950s have been treated unfairly by the rapid changes and the way they were communicated to those affected. Many thousands said they had no idea they would have to wait longer to receive their state pension, and had suffered financial and emotional distress as a result.\n• None What is the row over women's state pension?\n\nWhile the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) could recommend compensation, it could not enforce it. The work and pensions secretary said the government would develop an action plan to fix problems identified in the ombudsman's report, and set a clear notice of any future changes to the state pension age. She said that future pension communications would also use \"the most up to date methods\" to contact those affected. Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Steve Darling said the government had \"turned its back on millions of pension-age women who were wronged through no fault of their own\". For the Conservatives, who did not respond to the ombudsman's report when in power, shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately said ministers must \"own\" the decision not to give payouts. A petition to Parliament for a compensation system to be introduced had reached 135,000 signatures before Tuesday's announcement.\n\nThe Waspi campaign and others have highlighted previous comments made by the the prime minister, as well as Kendall, before they came to power. Both spoke of the \"injustice\" that the women faced, with such a post from 2019 still on the latter's website, external. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: \"The fact that many of the women affected will also be coping with the loss of their Winter Fuel Payment this year will intensify their sense of injustice.\" However, not everyone has criticised the government's decision.

{"context": "Meet five of the youngest election candidates: 'I haven’t got my A-level results yet'\n\nThey’re all under 30 and determined to make a difference - here, five of the youngest candidates tell the BBC why they’re standing in next month's general election. Last Thursday, Pedro Da Conceicao sat his final A-Level exam - but instead of celebrating with friends he was straight back out on the campaign trail. At 18 years old, Pedro - who is running as an independent in west London - is thought to be the youngest candidate standing in this year's election. He’d wondered about politics as a potential future career - but it was only when the general election was called at the end of May that he decided he would run to be an MP. \"My mum thought I was joking when I first told her,\" he says. Born in Portugal, Pedro moved to the UK with his mother when he was baby, and says it was the underrepresentation of young people in Parliament which motivated him to stand. He cites his mother, an NHS nurse, as an influence on his politics. \"I saw my mum come to the UK as an immigrant and work really, really hard,\" he says. \"I saw first hand the benefit of immigrants and how they could help our economy.\"\n\nPedro hopes to inspire other young people to get into politics\n\nPedro also wants to see more investment in public services and efforts to tackle knife crime. He's seen some of his peers turn to drugs and gangs to make money to support their families. But, he says, many politicians are out of touch with his reality. \"How can you expect people that have been privately educated or are way older to solve an issue that they can't relate to?” Running as an independent, without financial backing or a team behind him, has been a challenge. He covered the £500 deposit to stand - which is returned if a candidate gets 5% of votes cast - through a crowdfunder, as well as using earnings from his part-time restaurant job. \"But hopefully I can inspire more young people to get involved in politics.\"\n• None The full list of candidates standing in Ealing Southall is here\n\nThe average age of MPs has remained around 50 for the past 45 years. Political journalist Michael Crick says while \"there's always been young candidates\", it's possible more could be elected this time. He points to a number of Labour candidates in their 20s who are running in seats which are potentially winnable. And if current polls are accurate, he says there could be a big turnover of MPs - with lots of new Labour faces. That, combined with the large number of experienced MPs standing down, could mean a drop in the average age of the new Parliament.\n\nMartha is 26 - the same age as the youngest MP in the last Parliament\n\nLabour candidate Martha O'Neil is hoping to be one of those fresh faces. The 26-year-old is standing in a new Welsh seat. Martha grew up in Ammanford, a former mining town, and was raised by her mum after her dad died when she was 10. It was her family's reliance on state support that inspired her to get into politics. Using her education maintenance grant to buy the books she needed to prepare for university, Martha won a scholarship to Cambridge and went on to work as a civil servant. She believes young people have a unique perspective they can bring to politics, and that's what she hopes to do in Caerfyrddin. \"Making sure that we platform young voices is critical to make sure that we have a democracy that truly represents the UK as a whole.\"\n• None The full list of candidates standing in Caerfyrddin is here\n\nLuke says the reaction to his age has been more positive on the doorstep than online\n\nLuke Allan Holmes - who is standing for the Conservatives - agrees. The 21-year-old says while most voters are \"pleasantly surprised\" to see someone his age standing for Parliament, some on social media have questioned whether he has the life experience to be an MP. \"I didn't go to university,\" says Luke, whose previous jobs include staffing the checkouts at his local branch of Tesco and working for HMRC. \"People need to realise that actually some young people have gone through a lot in life and have a lot to offer.\" Growing up in County Durham, Luke says he felt the area was \"taken for granted\" by Labour politicians.

Now full-time, she says more than 60% of her wages go on housing. The 21-year-old wants to see maintenance grants brought back to help students cover living costs, as well as action to tackle unaffordable rents. Although she was only 13 when the UK voted to leave the European Union, it was the impact of Brexit on young people that got her into politics. By the age of 16 she had joined the Lib Dems and leafleted for the party at the 2019 general election. In 2022 she ran to be a local councillor in London, and the following year stood in Devon, where she grew up.

Netanyahu arrives in court to begin testifying in his trial in Tel Aviv\n\nThis was a remarkable day for Israel: Benjamin Netanyahu holds the record as its longest-serving prime minister. Now he has become the country's first serving leader to take to the witness stand as a defendant in a criminal case. Moreover, he did so amid ongoing war in Gaza and as Israel carries out attacks in Syria during a tumultuous week for the region. Netanyahu's lawyer, Amit Hadad, first opened the defence argument, portraying the corruption trial as biased and his client as the victim of a political witch-hunt. Prosecutors, he said, \"weren't investigating a crime, they were pursuing a man\".\n\nNetanyahu then sought to downplay the significance of the charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, and stress his political legacy. He strongly denies any wrongdoing. \"I have been waiting for eight years for this moment to tell the truth,\" the veteran leader told the court in Tel Aviv. \"But I am also a prime minister… I am leading the country through a seven-front war, and I think the two can be done in parallel.\"\n\nOver the past four years, prosecutors have alleged that Netanyahu exchanged regulatory favours with media owners in Israel seeking positive press coverage. They also accuse him of accepting pricey gifts - including cigars and pink champagne - in exchange for advancing the personal interests of a millionaire Hollywood producer. Netanyahu told the three-judge panel that Israeli media had launched \"absurd\" attacks on him over the years. He said it was \"doubly absurd\" to suggest the presents he had received from wealthy friends were illicit. In a long diatribe, the prime minister, who leads the right-wing Likud party, criticised his country's media for what he suggested was its leftist stance. He accused Israeli journalists of hostility towards him over the years because he did not join the push for a Palestinian state. Standing rather than sitting through his testimony, Netanyahu said: \"Had I wanted good coverage all I would have had to have done would be to signal toward a two-state solution... Had I moved two steps to the left I would have been hailed.\" The Israeli PM smiled widely when he first entered the Tel Aviv District Court around 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT) and stayed until proceedings concluded just before 16:00. The trial was moved from Jerusalem after being delayed for security reasons and convened in a small underground courtroom that also serves as a bomb shelter. A limited number of accredited journalists were able to enter to report - others had to follow via a live feed from a room on the floor above. Testifying is expected to take up a large portion of Netanyahu's time over the coming weeks. Last week, judges ruled that he must appear twice in court this week and then three times a week going forward. He is expected to shuttle between the courthouse and the war room at the nearby Israeli defence ministry.\n\nProminent ministers turned up at the courthouse during the morning in a show of support for the veteran leader and to criticise the legal proceedings. \"The court had to humiliate the Prime Minister, has to disgrace the state of Israel and hurt the security of the state,\" said the Likud transportation minister, Miri Regev. \"What would have happened if they would have postponed his testimony by a few months?\" Outside the court, a line of security guards kept apart small but noisy crowds of people supporting and protesting Netanyahu. Eliza Ziv, from Hadera, north of Tel Aviv, said that in times of turmoil, no other Israeli leader came close to the PM's capabilities. She added that the \"the hatred of the anti-Netanyahu camp, it's not just hate for him, but for his supporters\". Meanwhile, standing on the other side of the courthouse entrance, Siviona from Tel Aviv ", "continuation": "told me she saw the veteran leader as \"an enemy of the people\" who prioritised his political survival above the best interests of the country.\n\nAmong Netanyahu's critics near the court on Tuesday was Siviona\n\nSome relatives and supporters of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza came to press for more to be done to free their loved ones. Hadas Kalderon's two children were released as part of a temporary truce last year, while her ex-husband, Ofer, remains in captivity. She told the BBC that the prime minister \"cares more about his own sins, his private sins, more than caring for his citizens\". \"He doesn't care about the hostages. It's very sad\". Prior to the war in Gaza, Netanyahu's trial opened up deep divisions in Israel and dominated discourse through five successive Israeli elections. Critics of the prime minister saw his current government's efforts to curb the powers of the judiciary as linked to his legal troubles, although he denied that. While the deadly attack by Hamas on 7 October 2023 brought public unity, that has largely fallen apart as the war that it triggered has dragged on. In recent weeks, Israel has reached a fragile ceasefire in Lebanon with the armed group, Hezbollah. But at the same time, there have been renewed domestic tensions between key cabinet ministers and the judiciary, with threats to bring back some contentious legal reforms. This trial is not expected to conclude for more than a year. Even if the prime minister was found guilty, he could then appeal to the Supreme Court, meaning that these legal proceedings look set to continue to overshadow Israeli politics for the foreseeable future."}

The Kurdistan Region Security Council said it categorically rejected the \"unfounded pretext\", while Israel remained silent.\n\nThe prime minister of Iraq's Kurdistan Region called the Iranian strikes on Irbil a \"crime against the Kurdish people\"\n\nFour of the IRGC's missiles destroyed the home of the prominent Kurdish businessman Peshraw Dizayee. He was killed in the attack, reportedly alongside his 11-month-daughter.\n\nAn adviser to Mr Barzani said it was \"absolutely preposterous to suggest [he] was involved in any kind of espionage, that he worked for Israel\", but Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian insisted on Wednesday that the IRGC did not make a mistake.\n\nDizayee owned and founded two companies - Falcon Group and Empire World - following the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. He was close to the powerful Barzani family, which is headed by the prime minister's father and Kurdistan Democratic Party leader Massoud Barzani.\n\nThe Falcon Group operates in various sectors, including security, construction, and oil and gas. Its security division has provided assistance to Western representatives and companies in Iraq.\n\nThe Irbil attack appeared to underscore the message that not only can the IRGC carry out precision strikes, but also that it has the ability to strike military installations near Irbil's international airport, where US and other foreign forces are stationed.\n\nThe IRGC's claim to have targeted Israeli facilities in Irbil also served a domestic political purpose in Iran, following a suspected Israeli strike in Syria on 25 December that killed a senior commander.\n\nOne of the four civilians reported killed in Irbil was Peshraw Dizayee, a prominent Kurdish businessman\n\nMonday night also saw the IRGC launch ballistic missiles at what it said were the bases of Islamic State (IS) group and \"terrorist groups\" in Syria's north-western province of Idlib.\n\nIdlib is the last remaining stronghold of the Syrian opposition after 12 years of war against the government of President Bashar al-Assad, who has managed to stay in power because of the military backing of Russia and Iran. The Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sharm (HTS) dominates Idlib, although IS and al-Qaeda are also present there.\n\nThe IRGC said the strikes in Idlib were carried out in retaliation for twin IS suicide bomb attacks in Kerman, in southern Iran, on 3 January, which killed 94 people. The bombers targeted crowds gathered near the tomb of Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani to mark the fourth anniversary of his assassination in a US drone strike.\n\nThe IRGC said it used a Kheibar Shekan (Castle Buster) missile, which can travel up to 1,450km (900 miles), to target Idlib.\n\nIt also said the missile was launched from the southern province of Khuzestan, even though it could have done so from the western province of Azerbaijan, which is much closer to Syria.\n\nThe choice of missile and launch location suggest that Iran wants to convey to the world its ability to reach various locations in Israel, which borders Syria."}

However, the Post Office carried on with the prosecutions.\n\nAt a hearing before MPs, Mr Patterson also said that Fujitsu had a \"moral obligation\" to contribute to compensation for sub-postmasters wrongly prosecuted as a result of its faulty software.\n\nOn Thursday, Fujitsu Group, which is based in Japan, said that it would \"be working with the UK government on the appropriate actions, including contribution to compensation\".\n\n\"The Fujitsu Group hopes for a swift resolution that ensures a just outcome for the victims,\" it added."}

The Italian professional dancer, 33, has been on the BBC One celebrity dancing contest since 2015, winning it in 2021 with actress Rose Ayling-Ellis. The news comes weeks after he denied reports about his teaching methods on the show. Pernice had said he was surprised by allegations about his dance teaching methods, and rejected \"any suggestion of abusive or threatening behaviour\".

Lianne Gordon, 42, had only just returned from a holiday in Jamaica with her two children when she was killed inside her home in Hackney, east London, on 5 December 2023. Joshua Alexander, 17, was given a life sentence at the Old Bailey earlier. The court previously heard Ms Gordon had been the unintended victim of a feud between rival gangs and that she had been trying to protect her children from gang violence.\n\nThe court heard Jason Alexander had a series of previous convictions dating back to when he was 15 years old\n\nJudge David Aubrey KC lifted a reporting restriction on naming Alexander, who turns 18 in February. The teen denied being the gunman but was found guilty of Ms Gordon's murder in October following a trial at the same court. A jury also found him guilty of attempting to kill a 17-year-old boy and 21-year-old man who were shot in the street during the same attack. Alexander was additionally convicted of affray, having a firearm with intent to endanger life, possession of a bladed article, and possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.\n\nSentencing the teenager, Judge Aubrey told him: \"You murdered an innocent woman who was behind her front door in her own home. \"Her home should have been a sanctuary, a place of safety.\" The judge said Alexander was \"on a mission that", "continuation": " night to execute members of your opposing gang\" and had \"devastated\" Ms Gordon's family, causing them \"unimaginable grief\".

She told the court: \"I feel like I have lost my other half. \"She had nothing but love for me, as she did for everyone who was lucky enough to be in her circle.\" Ms Gordon's sister added: \"I feel like I'm underwater most days trying to stay afloat. My mind is still in constant turmoil.\" She said her twin was \"shot like a gangster\" in her own home, adding: \"This gun crime has ripped a hole in my family and there is nothing we can do about it.\" Family members in court cheered as the sentence was passed down by the judge, while another person in the public gallery shouted \"rot in hell\".\n\nMs Gordon had just returned from a holiday in Jamaica when she was killed\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutor Mark Fenhalls KC told the jury Alexander was associated with the Pembury Gang from Hackney, which was in dispute with the Amhurst Road gang. The court heard Alexander had a series of convictions dating back to when he was 15 years old. At the time of the shooting, Alexander had been on bail, with conditions not to enter Hackney, for attempted murder relating to a separate incident last March. Det Ch Insp Joanna Yorke, who led the Met Police investigation, said: “Alexander is a dangerous individual, who at just 16 years old had no qualms about carrying and using a deadly weapon. \"We are pleased he has been brought to justice and that he will now spend a significant period behind bars.\""}

Now, they've given an update on their progress, saying the first two years of their Music of the Spheres tour saw a 59% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared with their previous world tour. They have used things like a dancefloor that generates electricity when fans jump up and down, and have cut down on air travel. They have also revealed that seven million saplings have been planted as part of a commitment to grow a tree for every fan attending the shows. \"As a band, and as an industry, we’re a long way from where we need to be on this,\" they said in a statement. \"But we’re grateful for everyone’s help so far, and we salute everyone who’s making efforts to push things in the right direction.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Two years later, they announced a plan to tackle those issues, including:\n• None Solar panels, kinetic flooring and exercise bikes that help to power the venues\n• None Minimising air travel, with sustainable aviation fuel used where flying is unavoidable\n• None Building sets with sustainable materials like bamboo, where possible At the time, frontman Chris Martin said he was prepared for a \"backlash\" over areas like air travel, where the band were still having a negative environmental impact. \"The people that give us backlash for that kind of thing, for flying, they're right,\" he said. \"So we don't have any argument against t", "continuation": "hat.\" However, he did pledge to take public transport to gigs when possible - and arrived for their shows in Cardiff last year by train.\n\nAn interim report, released last July, suggested the band had fallen short of their goals, achieving a 47% reduction in carbon emissions. New figures suggest, external the tour has become more efficient as it progresses. Among the developments, 72% of tour waste was diverted from landfill and sent for reuse, recycling and composting - up from 66% in 2023. And the band said the energy produced by in-venue solar installations, kinetic dancefloors and power bikes has increased from 15 to 17 KwH per show - enough to power one of the smaller stage areas each night, and provide the crew with phone, laptop and tool-charging stations. They said the figures had been assessed and verified by the environmental solutions initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Coldplay have also funded two solar-powered \"ocean cleanup river interceptors\", which extract plastics from the ocean.\n\nFans use electricity-generating bicycles at a Coldplay concert in Amsterdam\n\nMIT's Professor John E Fernandez praised the band for \"setting a new standard for the entire music industry\". \"With each subsequent year of their tour, they demonstrate an evolving vision and expanded commitment to move the entire music industry toward true and humane sustainability and planetary resilience.\" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme in December, Martin said he wanted to prove that sustainable touring was achievable. \"What we’re trying to do is actually not advocate at all but just prove that it makes business sense - because that’s where we feel you’ll really get people to change, saying, ‘Hey you can make more money'. \"At the end of the day, for a lot of people, that’s their primary consideration in every wealth bracket, so we’re really trying to show on this tour that being clean and green isn’t some charitable left-wing wishy-washy thing. \"It’s like, no, this is the best business sense too.\"\n\nThe band are not alone in tackling the environmental impact of making and playing music. In February, The 1975 played four \"carbon removed\" gigs at London's O2 Arena. The band and venue calculated that the shows generated 546 tonnes of carbon dioxide, mainly by fans travelling to the shows - so they removed an equivalent amount from the atmosphere using methods including tree-planting and direct air capture. More than a decade ago, Radiohead pioneered the use of low-energy LED lighting rigs, rather than more power-hungry spotlights. And Billie Eilish recently released her new album, Hit Me Hard And Soft, on recycled and eco-vinyl, with all the packaging made from recycled materials.

{"context": "A member of Stormont's health committee has asked if the Belfast Health Trust should be placed on \"special measures\" considering the delays and costs surrounding Belfast's new maternity hospital. Senior trust executives and Department of Health officials were summoned to the committee following further revelations about the facility, which is almost a decade behind schedule. DUP MLA Diane Dodds told The View she \"did not think anyone on the health committee today was satisfied with what they heard\" at the committee. It emerged that in the worst-case scenario of fixing the problems there could be a further delay of up to four years with an additional cost of up to £9m.\n\nA potentially dangerous bacteria was first discovered in the water systems at the hospital in 2022 and means there is no date yet for its opening.\n\nExperts are currently carrying a review into how significant the problem is at the site at the Royal Victoria Hospital. About £50,000 is to be spent repairing the latest issue with medical gas pipework, however on Thursday the committee heard that the worst-case scenario of water pipe repairs could run into many millions. A hospital trust or facility is placed in special measures when its rated as being \"inadequate\"; when questions are raised over leadership or when it is unable to make sufficient improvements in a reasonable timeframe. Typically to handle all this someone from outside the trust is appointed to oversee what is happening.\n\nIn what was billed as a fact-finding exercise into what has gone wrong at the maternity hospital, the committee's temporary chair Linda Dillon said she was \"absolutely confused\" following a briefing by the trust's interim chief executive Maureen Edwards. \"It is very comprehensive what you have given us, but I am confused still about where the responsibility lay,\" Dillon said. \"Learning is one thing, but if there is accountability then that also needs to play its part. \"If there are people who didn't do the right thing or who made a mistake or knew that something different should have been done, then we need to know and understand that, because it was public money.\" Ms Edwards said that the full report into the issue of the pseudomonas bacteria at the hospital would determine three potential courses of action. The worst case was that the entire water pipework would be replaced at a cost of £7-9m and could take three to four years, she told assembly members. \"I recognise, and I indeed share, the health committee's frustration and the public's frustration with the delays and the cost increases associated with the maternity hospital scheme,\" she said. \"Our focus at this juncture is obviously to safely open a 21st century hospital that the mothers and babies of Northern Ireland deserve, but we know that needs to be safe.\"\n\nColin McGrath asked who was holding the trust to account\n\nThe SDLP's Colin McGrath asked questions about how the trust was spending public money and who was holding it to account. Addressing the Department of Health officials, he said: \"You are the guys who are supposed to be keeping an eye on these guys (the health trust) and the work they are doing. \"If it were anywhere else, I would suspect, politely, these guys would be in special measures, they maybe as a trust can't be trusted with public money in terms of delivering services, because they are going way over budget.\" In September, the BBC revealed that pseudomonas was again discovered at the maternity hospital just weeks after it was officially accepted by the trust from the contractor. The trust took possession of the five-story building in March this year, but high levels of the bug were discovered in water pipes a month later after a four-week operating exercise and sample testing. Trust officials said that while the former chief executive (Dr Cathy Jack) had signed for the building, on a project that size it is not the sole responsibility of just one person but instead several groups and the former chief executive had signed on everyone's behalf. The board's chair, Ciaran Mulgrew, said it had been across all the problems since before 2023 and he said \"no-one is shirking responsibility\".\n\nDiane Dodds was speaking on The View\n\nSpeaking on BBC NI's The View on Thursday night, committee member, DUP MLA Diane Dodds said: \"I don't think anyone on the health committee today was satisfied with what they heard. \"I don't think anyone was satisfied in relation to the answers around the pipework. \"I don't think anyone was satisfied in relation to issues around accountability and how on earth the trust had managed to get themselves in this position.\" She added: \"I think they [the trust] have got to get on ahead and sort this out.\"\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

The committee also heard about other issues, including fire alarms and nurse call buttons, which have been addressed and were no longer being treated as red flag rated issues which could delay opening. The BBC understands almost £200,000 was spent on the fire alarm problems, which was not fully tested before the handover. Nurse call alarms which had also been faulty are now working.

It doesn't come down to personal choice or to parenting preferences or behaviours,\" he said.\n\nThe Early LifeLab is a programme helping to tackle obesity among primary school children, run by NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre and University of Southampton\n\nSara Stanner, science director at the British Nutrition Foundation, said childhood obesity rates were already \"worryingly high\" before the pandemic and that this study \"underlines the need for action, particularly in areas of deprivation\".\n\n\"With many children starting school already overweight, it's important that we intervene in early life.\n\n\"Tackling obesity needs action across many areas of our society, but supporting children's health in the early years should be a key part of any approach,\" Ms Stanner said.\n\nThe Department for Health and Social Care said it was trying to tackle obesity across all socio economic groups.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"We require labelling on pre-packed foods to set out a variety of information to aid shoppers, including a list of ingredients and nutritional data, and we have introduced legislation to restrict the placement of foods high in fat, sugar or salt in supermarkets.\"\n\nIt said it also runs a Healthy Start scheme, encouraging healthy diets for families from lower-income households.\n\nAre you affected by the issues raised in this story?

{"context": "Milei, Musk and Maga: Is Argentina influencing the US?\n\nAs Argentina's maverick libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his efforts to revive the economy are still a work in progress - but his policies are proving influential in the US. Milei came to power with a mission to cut state spending in a country that had been living beyond its means for years. Despite his tough austerity measures and a continued rise in poverty rates, he is still supported by just over half the population, according to a survey carried out earlier this month, external by the CB Consultora organisation. That level of popularity is similar to that of Donald Trump right now. Roughly half of US voters backed the president-elect in last month's presidential contest - and Trump has hailed Milei as a man who can \"make Argentina great again\".\n\nMeanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk, who looks set to play a key role in the incoming US administration, has also praised Milei, saying Argentina is \"experiencing a giant improvement\" under his leadership. But what is it that Trump and Musk see in Milei? And are they as close ideologically as is often assumed?\n\nPrices are still going up in Argentina, just more slowly\n\nMilei's biggest achievement so far, the one which is most prized by Argentines, is his success in cutting inflation. But he has caused a stir in the US because of his deregulation drive, which has been seized on by small-government ", "continuation": "activists keen to shrink the size of the state in Washington along the lines of what is happening in Buenos Aires. In Milei's initial package of measures, he slashed state subsidies for fuel and cut the number of government ministries by half. Now he is trying to force through plans for a mass sell-off of state-run companies, including the country's flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas, which has already been privatised once before being renationalised in 2008. All this is music to the ears of Elon Musk, who is being tasked with similar cost-cutting initiatives under the banner of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency - a misleading name, since it is an advisory body, not an official government department. Musk and his co-leader in the department, fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, have said they want to slash federal regulations, oversee mass layoffs and shut down some agencies entirely. Musk has spoken of cutting federal government spending by $2tn (£1.6tn) - about one-third of annual expenditure. According to him, Milei is doing \"a fantastic job\" in Argentina by \"deleting entire departments\" - and he would like to follow suit in the US, with Trump's blessing.\n\nTrump and Milei think highly of each other\n\nMonica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, says that \"taking inspiration from Milei to reduce the size of government doesn't make any sense\". \"The situation in Argentina is very particular to Argentina, because it was about the removal of decades of mismanagement of public resources. That has nothing to do with the US.\" Ms de Bolle says Argentina had no choice but to take action, because government overspending was so excessive that the country was \"bursting into crisis every few years\". \"That is appropriate for Argentina, but for nobody else.\"\n\nPlans to privatise Aerolineas Argentinas are part of Milei's cost-cutting drive\n\nMarcelo J García, Buenos Aires-based director for the Americas at global consulting firm Horizon Engage, says Milei's decision to wield a chainsaw on the campaign trail as a sign of his approach to government was a \"masterpiece\" of political marketing that has \"captured the imagination of small-state activists across the globe\". But he argues that while Musk's own business interests would benefit from less government regulation, that's not necessarily what Trump wants. \"I'm not sure that the Trump platform is compatible with a Milei-type chainsaw small government,\" he told the BBC. He points out that Trump's policies \"require big government in some areas\", such as the building of border walls and mass deportations of illegal immigrants. \"You can't do those kinds of massive programmes with small government.\" In Milei's view, infrastructure projects are best left to the private sector and have nothing to do with government.\n\nMilei supporters were out in force at this month's Mercosur summit in Montevideo\n\nMilei and Trump are on the same side in the global culture wars, denouncing what they see as the \"woke agenda\". But in economic terms, their ideas are very different. Milei is a passionate free-trader, and Argentina is a member of the South American trading bloc Mercosur, which also includes Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. While he is in favour of Mercosur's recent free-trade deal with the European Union, he doesn't like the way that the organisation refuses to let its individual member countries strike their own deals. As a result, he says Mercosur \"has ended up becoming a prison\". \"If the bloc is not a dynamic engine that facilitates trade, boosts investment and improves the quality of life of all the citizens of our region, what is the point of it?\" he said at the Mercosur summit in Uruguay earlier this month where the deal with the EU was signed. Trump also has beef with his own regional trade alliance, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), but for reasons that are the opposite of Milei's. Trump wants to renegotiate the USMCA, a deal that he himself put together during his first term in office, as a way of protecting US manufacturing and safeguarding US jobs. He has even found a way of weaponising the alliance by threatening to impose a blanket 25% tariff on goods from both Canada and Mexico unless they secure their shared borders with the US.\n\nMilei wants free trade to prevail in the port of Buenos Aires\n\nMonica de Bolle doubts that Trump shares Musk's enthusiasm for a smaller state: \"You can't be a populist nationalist and care about the size of government. So Trump doesn't care. He put Elon there because it's kind of fun to have someone there making noise.\" The economic debate is set to run and run, in both the US and Argentina. But ultimately, if one half of your population supports you, it means the other half doesn't. Trump will have to deal with that after his inauguration on 20 January, but Milei is already having to cope with his own polarised population. As Marcelo J García sees it, Milei is a \"divisive leader\" who has made no attempt to win over his opponents. \"The other half of the country that did not support him will arguably never support him, no matter how well the economy does, because he doesn't want them to support him,\" he says. \"Leaders tend to want to be liked by everyone. That's not the case with Milei,\" he adds. In his view, this is a real weakness: \"You don't build a long-term sustainable political project if you don't move towards the people who didn't vote for you.\" Milei's next big test of public opinion will come in October 2025, when Argentina holds midterm elections. That could prove crucial in deciding whether his small-government revolution determines the country's future - or whether, like previous attempts at reform, it runs out of steam."}

Mr Swinney finds himself in the midst of a general election campaign less than a month after he succeeded Humza Yousaf as SNP leader and first minister\n\nScotland's first minister has admitted the SNP faces a \"tough challenge\" in the upcoming general election. John Swinney said he wants the SNP - which won 48 seats in the last election - to hold on to its current status as the third largest party at Westminster. And he said his party again winning a majority of seats in Scotland would see him attempt to \"open up\" the process of independence. Mr Swinney succeeded Humza Yousaf as SNP leader and first minister less than a month ago. Recent opinion polls have suggested his party is facing a tough fight with Labour on 4 July if it is to continue to be Scotland's biggest party at Westminster.\n\nMr Yousaf resigned after ending a power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens, which means the SNP now runs a minority government in the Scottish Parliament. The party has also had to deal with an on-going police investigation into its finances. Last week this resulted in a report being sent to Scotland's prosecution service in relation to former SNP chief executive Peter Murrell - the husband of former leader Nicola Sturgeon - who was charged with embezzling party funds. Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie said earlier this week that voters were telling her party on the doorsteps that they are \"fed up with the broken status quo after 17 years of the SNP and 14 years of the Tories\".\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross showed Scotland's last three first ministers the red card while on the campaign trail\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives are hopeful of holding on to their existing seats north of the border - and believe they can win some more - and are urging voters to \"show the SNP the red card\". And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton says his party’s MPs will hold the feet of the next government to the fire, whoever ends up in Downing Street. Meanwhile, Mr Swinney denied he is feeling the heat from Labour despite taking over the leadership after a difficult period for his party. He said: \"That's why I'm here. I'm here because the SNP faced a tough challenge and faces that. \"But we're working around the country to try to overcome that and I'm giving it all of my energy to make sure the SNP successful in this election.\"\n\nLabour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer and Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar at the Port of Greenock in Inverclyde\n\nThe choice facing the electorate on 4 July has been framed as a straight battle for Number 10 between Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. But Mr Swinney denied the easiest way to \"get rid of the Tories\" was to vote Labour. He said: \"We've got six Tory MPs in Scotland and the SNP are the challengers in every single one of those constituencies. \"So we're second place in each constituency. \"So if we want to numerically get rid of the Tories in Scotland, people should vote SNP and that will get rid of the Tories in those constituencies.\" Mr Swinney said he believed it was important for the SNP to continue to be the third largest party in the United Kingdom and criticised the decision to exclude the party from some UK-wide TV leadership debates. He said: \"I think it's ridiculous that broadcasters are tolerating a situation that they're not having the leader of the third party on their on their broadcast debates. \"It's anti democratic, and broadcasters need to reflect on it.\"\n\nAsked what he could do to force a fresh independence poll, Mr Swinney said: \"Well we can maintain the pressure on Westminster to actually follow a democratic plan, because it is ridiculous that in a western democracy, a UK government would stand in the face of the wishes and the will of people in Scotland to be democratic.\" The SNP leader said this was \"to his credit\" accepted by then Prime Minister David Cameron when he agreed to hold a referendum in 2014, which saw voters back remaining in the UK by 55% to 45%.. He added: \"I think that and that was accepted across the entire political spectrum. \"So that very simple principle that the people of this country have the right to self determination should be respected. \"And the best way to effect that is by voting SNP in this election.\"\n\nOn the domestic front, Mr Swinney was challenged about statistics which show a greater percentage of patients in Scotland are waiting up to two years for treatment compared to England. He said: \"Well we’re making progress on sorting that out and those long waits are coming down. \"But I accept that’s not good enough. \"So we have to improve that performance.\" The SNP leader said other indicators demonstrated Accident and Emergency performance in Scotland was the best in the UK and had been for nine years. But when it was put to him that the waits were a \"big thing\" for those on the lists, he said: \"I accept that health service performance is not whe", "continuation": "re it needs to be. \"A lot of that is the aftermath of Covid and the impact that's had on the system, but it's also the impact of austerity. \"That's why I made my call today for any incoming government to commit to end austerity.\" Mr Swinney said the next government must invest in the health service and warned Labour's decision to sign up for the spending arrangements of the Tories would be \"disastrous\"."}

The change is described by the Home Office as \"an interim measure\" expected to be in place until June 2025, when it will be reassessed. Officials said in the letters the move was designed to support local authorities after research suggested a significant rise in refugee homelessness over the past year.\n\nIn October 2022, Home Office officials said the daily bill for housing asylum seekers in hotels was £5.6m a day. A fast-track element was added to the UK's asylum system to speed up the processing of those whose claims were likely to be accepted because of the countries they had come from. Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Syria and Yemen were put on the fast-track list in February 2023. Some claims related to people from Iran and Iraq were also processed more quickly. The Home Office's annual accounts, published last September, promised to \"take action to address the unacceptable costs of housing migrants in hotels\" and revealed the cost had risen to £8m a day. Ministers announced claims would be processed more quickly to allow hotels to be closed. They also changed the move-on system, altering the stage at which the 28-day move-on period began and effectively reducing the period to seven days. That change was reversed a few weeks later, but many charities claim that was the trigger for a refugee homelessness problem that has not gone away. The number of hotels housing asylum seekers has significantly decreased during that time. But last month, a Home Office minister acknowledged the number of hotels had started to increase. This month, the Home Office refused a BBC Freedom of Information request asking whether the overall hotel bill had also come down.\n\nLabour campaigned on a promise to cut the asylum backlog, which hit record numbers under the Conservative government. But the Home Office's faster processing has partly led to a rising number of homeless refugees, who have been evicted from government accommodation hotels. This has placed further pressures on councils and charities already dealing with high levels of rough sleeping.\n\nOfficial government data released last week showed a record 123,100 households were in temporary accommodation at the end of June, a 16% rise on last year. Research published last month by the No Accommodation Network, an umbrella group for organisations in the asylum sector, suggested a big rise in refugee homelessness over the last year. They said 1,941 adults granted leave to remain had found themselves without accommodation in 2023/24 - a rise from 977 in 2022/23. The organisation called on the government to do more to combat the \"refugee homelessness emergency\". The government's Homelessness Reduction Act, which was implemented in 2018, acknowledged that at least 56 days are usually needed to find accommodation. Currently, a refugee granted leave to remain is given up to 28 days to find somewhere to live before they are evicted from Home Office accommodation. If a newly-recognised refugee does not find somewhere to live in that time, they often declare themselves as homeless to a local authority. A lack of available accommodation options has meant many councils and charities have had to use more expensive options, such as hotels and bed and breakfasts, to house those in need. The boss of a homelessness charity in Manchester told Radio 4's Today programme this week it had seen a huge increase in the number of asylum seekers or ", "continuation": "refugees -from 30% to more than 60% of the charity's caseload in the last 12 months. She did not say how many people this equated to. Jo Walby, chief executive of Mustard Tree, said refugees often struggle to \"access the private rented market\" in big cities like Manchester. She added: \"The reality is, you can't learn English, you can't work, and then you have four weeks to be told to find a job and find a house and you don't have access to government support or council support, because you don't have priority need.\" Matt Downie, head of the homelessness charity Crisis, said: \"This extension will ensure that people trying to rebuild their lives after fleeing war and persecution won't face further trauma of life on the streets. \"This is a hugely positive step... it's important that this becomes a permanent change next year if we're going to ensure that refugees granted settled status don't face homelessness in the future.\" Phil Kerry, the chief executive of New Horizons Youth Centre, a London-based charity that helps young homeless people, said: \"The timing of this news could not be better and crucially means that we won't have more refugees pushed onto the streets this Christmas.\" A Home Office spokesperson said: \"We have inherited enormous pressures in the asylum system and remain absolutely committed to ending the use of hotels as we ramp up returns of failed asylum seekers.\""}

Rishi Sunak says that UK strikes on Houthi military targets in Yemen were \"in self-defence\"\n\nJoint US-UK strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen were intended as a \"limited, single action\", Rishi Sunak has said.\n\nFollowing reports of more attacks by the rebel group on ships in the Red Sea on Monday, the prime minister refused to speculate whether he would take further military action in response.\n\nBut he said the UK \"will not hesitate to protect our security, our people and our interests where required\".\n\nLabour said it backed the \"targeted action\".\n\nHowever, leader Sir Keir Starmer told the Commons military action must be \"underpinned by a clear strategy\".\n\nHe added that the strikes still carried risks and \"we must avoid escalation across the Middle East\".\n\nThe Houthis - a military and political group who control the north of Yemen and its capital Sanaa - have been attacking cargo ships in the Red Sea since November.\n\nLast Thursday, the US and UK carried out air strikes on military Houthi targets in response.\n\nGiving a Commons statement, Mr Sunak told MPs the government's \"initial assessment\" was that all 13 planned targets were destroyed, while there was no evidence of civilian casualties so far.\n\nHe said the \"proportionate\" action was taken \"in self-defence\" and was \"limited, not escalatory\".\n\nHis statement came shortly after American officials said the Houthis had hit a US-owned ship off the coast of Yemen with a missile.\n\nEarlier, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations security agency also reported that missile fire had struck a ship near Yemen's southern port city of Aden.\n\nAsked whether he would take more military action if necessary, Mr Sunak said: \"I won't speculate on future action.\n\n\"This was intended as limited, single action and we hope the Houthis will now step back and end their destabilising attacks.\n\n\"But of course... we will not hesitate to protect our security, our people and our interests where required.\"\n\nThe Houthi attacks have led major shipping companies to divert vessels away from the Red Sea, instead taking a longer route around southern Africa.\n\nMr Sunak said this \"pushes up prices, and imperils the passage of goods, foods and medicines that the British people and others rely on\".\n\nHe added that there were also risks from not acting, which he said \"would weaken international security and the rule of law, further damage freedom of navigation and the global economy, and send a dangerous message that British vessels and British interests are fair game\".\n\nThe Houthis - who are allies of Iran - have said they are attacking ships affiliated with Israel in protest at the war in Gaza.\n\nHowever, commercial vessels with no connection to the country also appear to have been targeted.\n\nMr Sunak said the UK-US strikes were \"completely unrelated\" to the Israel-Gaza conflict and were \"a direct response to the Houthis' attacks on international shipping\".\n\nHe added that the group were targeting ships from around the world and \"we shouldn't fall for their malign narrative\".\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, the SNP and Plaid Cymru had argued the government should hold a vote on the strikes.\n\nThe government is not legally required to ", "continuation": "seek parliamentary approval before taking military action. However, a convention has been established in recent years under which the Commons is - in most circumstances - given the opportunity to debate the deployment of military forces in advance.\n\nSNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn called on the PM to reveal his long-term strategy if the Houthi attacks continued, adding: \"We cannot have an escalation which leads to further regional instability.\"\n\nLib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said his party supported \"limited\" strikes against the Houthis but it was \"regrettable\" there was no vote on the action.\n\nHe urged Mr Sunak to ensure the strikes remained \"limited\", describing the region as \"a tinderbox\".\n\nDefending the decision not to consult Parliament before the action, Mr Sunak said it was \"necessary to strike at speed... to protect the security of these operations\".\n\nHowever, the prime minister added that he had addressed MPs on the issue \"at the earliest opportunity\".\n\nThe Houthis, who control most of the populated parts of Yemen, now have three options.\n\nThey can back down, having made their point, raised their regional profile and increased their popularity at home.\n\nTheir actions to date show no sign of them doing this.\n\nThey can continue to harass military and commercial shipping off their coasts, which they appear to be now doing.\n\nOr - and this is the option the West should worry about - they could marshal their remaining missiles and drones and wait for the opportunity to launch a mass attack on a US or British warship, in the hopes of overwhelming its air defences. This is something the Houthi spokesman has already hinted at and it remains a real risk.\n\nUS intelligence assesses that the recent airstrikes on the Houthis' military facilities have destroyed or degraded around a quarter of their arsenal.\n\nFurther airstrikes will degrade that further so the Houthis will need to make some careful calculations as to how far they take this beyond their fiery rhetoric about retaliation.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox."}
{"context": "An inquest into the death of broadcaster Dr Michael Mosley has not been able to determine a cause, with the coroner instead recording an open conclusion. The 67-year-old science journalist went missing in June after going for a walk on the Greek island of Symi. His disappearance sparked a high-profile search effort by emergency services and his body was found after four days. In written findings, senior coroner for Buckinghamshire Crispin Butler said the cause of Dr Mosley's death was \"indeterminate\" and \"unascertainable\" - and \"was most likely attributable either to heatstroke (accidental) or non-identified pathological cause\".\n\nMr Butler said Dr Mosley's death was not found to be as a result of homicide, suicide, or an accident related to injuries. An open conclusion by a coroner means there is insufficient evidence to decide how a death came about - the case is left open in case further evidence comes to light. Dr Mosley, a broadcaster for almost 20 years, known for programmes that focused on diet, exercise and medicine, had been staying with family and friends when they travelled to Pedi Beach on the morning of 5 June, a findings document said. \"Michael had intentionally left his mobile phone back at the house to prevent it getting wet on the ferry,\" the document added. \"Later in the afternoon Michael decided he was going to walk back home rather than take the ferry.\" The findings said Dr Mosley had a rucksack, a litre of water, a biscuit, a hat and an umbrella with him and was \"described as looking energetic and cheerful as he set off\".\n\nFollowing a large search effort, Dr Mosley's body was found next to a fence around 30 minutes walk from Pedi, where he was last seen\n\nHe collapsed and died on the same day in a rocky area near Agia Marina Beach on the island, Mr Butler said in his written findings. \"There had been high temperatures during this time,\" he concluded. \"Michael's death was most likely attribu", "continuation": "table either to heatstroke (accidental) or a non-identified pathological cause.\" Mr Butler said there was \"nothing of note\" in toxicology results, while Dr Mosley's death \"may have been due to a medical event or as a result of a non-traumatic accident\". Greek authorities conducted an extensive search for Dr Mosley, deploying police officers, firefighters, divers and a helicopter. An initial post-mortem examination in June concluded that he had died of natural causes. Greek police spokeswoman Konstantia Dimoglidou told the BBC at the time that the post-mortem found no injuries on his body that could have caused his death. Dr Mosley's wife Dr Claire Mosley previously said she had been overwhelmed by the \"extraordinary\" outpouring of affection from the public following his death. The presenter fronted TV series including Trust Me I'm a Doctor and The Truth about Exercise - as well as the BBC Radio 4 series Just One Thing, which attracted 25 million listeners around the world. Millions more knew him for giving advice on BBC One's The One Show and ITV's This Morning. He was also famous for popularising the 5:2 and Fast 800 diets, which advocate for intermittent fasting and low-carbohydrate meals."}
{"context": "Assad loyalists kill 14 in clash with Syria's new ruling forces - authorities\n\nOpponents of Bashar al-Assad overthrew the regime in a lightning offensive\n\nSyria's new rebel-led authorities say supporters of ousted President Bashar al-Assad have killed 14 interior ministry troops in an \"ambush\" in the west of the country. They say 10 other troops were wounded in the fighting on Tuesday near the Mediterranean port of Tartous, a stronghold of Assad's minority Alawite Muslim sect. The clashes with pro-Assad loyalists are the first direct challenge to the authority of Syria's de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa. Assad's presidency fell to rebel forces led by al-Sharaa's Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) faction just over two weeks ago.\n• None Jeremy Bowen: Assad's torture prison is worst I have seen\n\nSecurity forces launched an operation in Tartous province on Thursday, according", "continuation": " to state news agency Sana, in a bid to \"restore security, stability and civil peace\". Sana reported that the forces had \"neutralised... a number of remnants of Assad's militias\" in the Tartous countryside, and that it was pursuing others. Reports say the security forces had earlier been ambushed as they tried to arrest a former officer in connection to his role at the notorious Saydnaya prison, close to the capital, Damascus. The UK-based monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said three \"armed men\", which it did not identify, were also killed in the clashes. The SOHR added that the security forces later brought in reinforcements. On Thursday, it said the former officer, Mohammed Kanjo Hassan, had been arrested together with 20 other people. The claim has not been independently verified. In a separate development, the Syrian authorities imposed an overnight curfew into Thursday in the central city of Homs, state media reported. Reports say this followed unrest over a video purportedly showing an attack on an Alawite shrine. The interior ministry said the footage was old, dating back to a rebel offensive on Aleppo in late November, and the violence was carried out by unknown groups. The SOHR said one demonstrator was killed and five wounded in Homs. The former rebels now in charge of Syria are grappling with the challenge of providing safety and stability across the country. Syrians are looking to them to protect the rights of people from a variety of backgrounds as well as providing justice for those who lost relatives under the Assad dictatorship. Demonstrations have also been reported in Alawite-dominated areas including the cities of Tartous and Latakia, and Assad's hometown of Qardaha. Alawites are an offshoot of Shia Islam to which many of the former regime's political and military elite belonged, including Assad's family. The Alawite community is fearful of revenge, with members blamed for the torture and killing in Syria under Assad. Former officers are refusing to hand over weapons and locals in some towns suggest they want to fight back, which appears to have been the case in Tartous. There have been calls from Alawite religious leaders for a general amnesty for Alawites - but this is unlikely because of the many alleged war crimes conducted by its members. Although al-Sharaa has bolstered security in Alawite towns and cities in an attempt to maintain order, if his forces do launch a campaign to arrest Assad loyalists, they risk further destabilising an already fragile country. Tens of thousands of people were tortured to death in prisons in Syria, and thousands of families are still waiting for answers and for justice. Syrians are calling for those responsible to be held to account - the very thing that members of the Alawite are worried about. The HTS-led lightning offensive that started from Syria's north-east and spread across the country ended more than 50 years of rule by the Assads. Assad and his family were forced to flee to Russia. HTS has since promised to protect the rights and freedoms of many religious and ethnic minorities in Syria. The group is designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, the US, the EU, the UK and others. On Tuesday, protests broke out in the country over the burning of a Christmas tree, prompting fresh calls for the new authorities to protect minorities."}

It will curb Hizb ut-Tahrir's ability to operate as it currently does.\"\n\nThe most serious offences linked to banned organisations can result in up to 14 years in jail. Police can also seize any property associated with a group once it has been banned.\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir was founded in 1953 as an international political movement calling for a single Islamic government across the Muslim world. It has branches in at least 32 countries including the UK - and the banning order means that all of those are now banned.\n\nMinisters and security officials have repeatedly considered banning the group in the UK in the past - and former prime minister Lord Cameron promised to do so in 2010.\n\nHowever, lawyers had previously told the government that the organisation had not crossed the line of breaking terrorism laws.\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir and its supporters believe they are involved in legitimate campaigns\n\nThe Home Office's change of mind came after former home secretary Suella Braverman asked for a review of the group's activities following the October rally.\n\nThe government says that since the 7 October attacks, Hizb ut-Tahrir has described Hamas fighters as \"heroes\" on its central website - and such praise amounts to promoting and encouraging terrorism.\n\nIt has also been repeatedly accused of celebrating attacks against Israel and Jews more widely.\n\nShe told the Commons: \"It is right that the government has looked urgently at the evidence and intelligence information available to them about the threat posed by Hizb ut-Tahrir, and we welcome and support the decision to proscribe them.\"\n\nFormer prime minister Sir Tony Blair looked at banning the group after the 2005 London bombings - but officials concluded that it was not involved in terrorism.\n\nOther countries that have banned the group include Germany, Egypt, Bangladesh, Pakistan and central Asian and Arab nations.\n\nIts leaders in the UK have previously said that these bans were politically motivated and not supported by evidence of involvement in terrorism."}
{"context": "Misinformation about Sir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak is among the content promoted to young voters' TikTok feeds\n\nYoung voters in key election battlegrounds are being recommended fake AI-generated videos featuring party leaders, misinformation, and clips littered with abusive comments, the BBC has found. With TikTok emerging as a new social media battleground in this election, the political parties have begun a war of memes on the app in a bid to reach its audience of young voters. But a BBC project to investigate the content promoted by social media algorithms has found - alongside funny montages - young people on TikTok are being exposed to misleading and divisive content. It is being shared by everyone from students and political activists to comedians and anonymous bot-like accounts. Videos which have racked up hundreds of thousands of views have promoted unfounded rumours that a major scandal prompted Rishi Sunak to call an early election and the baseless claim that Sir Keir Starmer was responsible for the failure to prosecute serial paedophile Jimmy Savile. Satirical, fake AI-generated clips show Rishi Sunak declaring, “Please don’t vote us out, we would be proper gutted!” and making unevidenced claims about how the Conservative leader is spending public money - including how he will send his “mates loads of dosh”.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nOther AI-generated videos share misleading claims about his national service pledge for 18-year-olds, suggesting young people would be sent to current war zones in Ukraine and Gaza. Some of these are described as satire or parody in captions, but the comments suggest some users are confused about which claims are factual. TikTok told the BBC it had increased its investment in countering misinformation for the UK general election, including adding a fact-checking expert to existing resources and employing AI-labelling technology. The videos were spotted as part of the BBC's Undercover Voters project, which has created profiles for 24 fictional people on all the major social media sites, based on data and analysis by the National Centre for Social Research, external (Natcen).\n\nIn a satirical deepfake, Rishi Sunak appeared to say he would be \"proper gutted\" if he lost - but some users were confused about whether it was real\n\nThe fictional profiles represent a range of voters in battleground constituencies across the UK, giving an insight into what content is promoted to different types of people. The profiles are private, with no friends. They just like, follow and watch content relevant to their character traits informed by the Natcen research. I examined the feeds of the profiles of three of these fictional voters in the former “red wall” constituency of Bishop Auckland, a target for Labour which is currently held by the Conservatives - and where our Undercover Voters are younger. Their social media feeds revealed that, while other sites have also experienced a flurry of political content, TikTok had the most lively conversation, particularly among younger voters. TikTok has boomed since the last election. According to media regulator Ofcom, it was the fastest-growing source of news in the UK for the second year in a row in 2023 - used by 10% of adults in this way. One in 10 teenagers say it is their most important news source. TikTok is engaging a new generation in the democratic process. Whether you use the social media app or not, what is unfolding on its site could shape narratives about the election and its candidates - including in ways that may be unfounded. Content promoted to Undercover Voter character Jack, a disaffected 31-year-old, include TikToks misrepresenting remarks made by Labour politicians in speech bubbles. These include comments about immigration, transgender rights, Brexit - and false claims that the shadow international development secretary called to “abolish the Army”.\n\nA video made reference to the unfounded story that Sir Keir Starmer was involved in the decision not to prosecute serial paedophile Jimmy Savile\n\nSeveral other videos repeated the unfounded allegations about Sir Keir and Jimmy Savile. Other videos Jack was served on his feed included clips with threats in the comments about “euthanizing” Rishi Sunak and racist remarks about him. Messages such as “vote Reform UK” were shared repeatedly in the comments of many videos, much more than those I saw in support of any other party. TikTok users have begun to notice the comments, with many calling the posters “Reform bots”, suggesting they could be fake, automated accounts. I contacted some of the commenters who had photos and names on their profiles, and they told me they were real people based in the UK with no official affiliation to Reform UK and with no encouragement or instruction from the party. But others were anonymous with no profile image and numerical usernames - common hallmarks of fake accounts - and they did not respond to my messages.\n\nWhether they are real people or not, their comments can create the impression that their preferred party has greater support. Another Undercover Voter character based in Bishop Auckland, 25-year-old Chloe, was created to have no prior interest in politics. But about one in 10 posts on her TikTok feed was a political meme or funny video, including official content coming from the Labour Party, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Reform UK. These include Rishi Sunak’s first TikTok on the Conservatives’ new account about national service, clarifying that he is not forcing all 18-year-olds to join the army. They also include a video of Cilla Black singing Surprise Surprise from the official Labour profile - with a caption saying “POV: Rishi Sunak turning up on your 18th birthday to send you to war”.\n\nOne post claimed without evidence that the election had been called because a scandal about Rishi Sunak was \"about to erupt\"\n\nA third Undercover Voter named Louise - in her 50s and politically undecided - was pushed more TikToks targeting political leaders with abusive comments, as well as satirical montages and parody videos about policy announcements such as national service. I tracked down some of the people behind the videos and posts shown to our Undercover Voters. One 16-year-old from the south of England, who made a satirical edit of that first Rishi Sunak TikTok about national service, said she was surprised how quickly her content took off. “I didn’t specifically create this account for the election and the reason I made the TikTok initially was just for a joke - I didn’t expect to get over 400k bloody views,” she said, adding that she is not affiliated with any party and has not received any money for creating the TikTok. “Social media really is the only platform for young people to have a voice nowadays in my opinion.” She said she knows satirical content can be “controversial” and she understands how her video “could mislead people” but would hope people could tell it was supposed to be a bit of fun. Alongside the video, some users had posted threatening comments towards Mr Sunak, but the 16-year-old said she did not think anyone would actually want to harm a politician.\n\nThere are 24 Undercover Voters in eight consituencies across the UK. For this story, we looked at three in Bishop Auckland\n\nDozens of other users I messaged who are creating this content are also in their late teens or early 20s, and want to get involved in creating political videos to engage other people their age in the election. They all tell me that while they may support a political party, they have not been paid for their posts and are not officially affiliated with any of the campaigns. One politics student tells me they “don’t worry about misleading people because the parties mislead others with their opinions about other parties”. Another person based in Coventry, who shares his videos about Reform UK, tells me he hopes to “boost their popularity in an unofficial way” and says he set up his account back in February. He say he is a member of the party and has not received any money for making his TikToks. He is concerned that satirical content - including his own - might unintentionally mislead people on TikTok. His account was restricted by TikTok for posting spam. A spokesperson for TikTok told the BBC that it had increased its investment “in efforts to ensure reliable information can be found on TikTok”, launching a “UK Election Centre with a fact-checking expert” and adopting an “industry-leading AI labelling technology”. It", "continuation": " also said it was introducing “more policies to aggressively counter foreign election interference” and that it removed 97% of videos with misinformation about elections and civic issues before anyone had viewed them.\n\nYou can find out more about the Undercover Voters project on Sunday's episode of Newscast here"}
{"context": "McIlroy was disconsolate after letting the US Open title slip from his grasp\n\nHow should we gauge the golfing year in 2024? Politically, turbulence continued with little sign of resolution, while executives came and went with unusual regularity. Americans swept the men's majors, bringing more heartbreak for Rory McIlroy, while Nelly Korda dominated a women's tour that lost some of its biggest names. Great Britain and Ireland were brilliant winners of the Curtis Cup, but the US finally caved in to player pressure for Ryder Cup team members to receive payment. In a sense, those two headlines summed up the game; there was still room for heartwarming romance despite much of the elite end being swept along a largely unchecked river of greed. There were some truly great performances yielding significant highs but there were also some worrying and tragic lows. Let's embark on a round to represent 2024 with, in no particular order, 18 of the key memories from the year.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler defended the Players Championship to set the tone for the year. So many of the greats have triumphed at Sawgrass, but no-one had won the title in consecutive years, until Wyndham Clark lipped out on the last to hand victory to Scheffler last March.\n\nThe tall Texan won at Bay Hill the week before the Players, and was then runner-up in Houston before landing a second Green Jacket with victory at the Masters. Scheffler eased home by four shots from Sweden's Ludvig Aberg, who was second on his major debut, with Eng;and's Tommy Fleetwood tied third. Scheffler, meanwhile, won the Heritage a week later in a period of stunning, dominant golf. In Tiger Woods fashion of yesteryear, no-one came close to challenging his position as top dog all year long.\n\nNelly Korda took a traditional plunge after winning the Chevron Championship\n\nWhile Scheffler set the standards in the men's game, Nelly Korda did similar on the women's circuit. Korda beat Lydia Ko at the Drive On Championship in late January to signal a run of five consecutive wins, culminating in the 26-year-old's second major win at the Chevron Championship. Korda was the first to win five in a row since Annika Sorenstam in 2004/5. She would go on to be the first player since Yani Tseng in 2011 to win seven tournaments in an LPGA Tour season.\n\nHowever, despite being hot favourite for the US Women's Open, Korda's hopes drowned inside three holes at Lancaster Country Club in Pennsylvania. Playing the back nine first, she dumped three balls into the water at the par-three 12th to rack up a ruinous 10 as she missed the cut.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Video shows moment Scottie Scheffler is taken away in handcuffs\n\nProving world number ones were not immune from left-field shocks, Scheffler was arrested on his way to the second round of the US PGA Championship. He drove past a policeman to escape a traffic jam at the entrance to Valhalla. The officer alleged assault and Scheffler was taken to jail in handcuffs. The world number one warmed up in a cell, was sprung on bail and fired a 66. All charges were later dropped. You couldn't make it up.\n\nA discomfited Scheffler could not sustain his challenge and Xander Schauffele capitalised to land his first major. The American birdied the last to beat LIV's Bryson DeChambeau on a course that proved far too easy for a major. Schauffele also won The Open with a sublime 65 at a far more testing, soggy, blowy Royal Troon on the Ayrshire coast. It meant US players won all four men's majors for the first time since 1982.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nDeChambeau atoned for missing out at Valhalla with the year's most dramatic major victory, beating Rory McIlroy for the US Open at Pinehurst. McIlroy led by two with five to play and his decade-long barren run in the big four seemed over. But he bogeyed 15, missed a tiddler on 16 and devilish short one on 18 to open the door for a ragged DeChambeau. The unconventional American fired the shot of the year from a fairway bunker to get up and down for a winning par at the last. It was LIV's and his second major win. McIlroy's haunted and shellshocked face in the recorders' area was image of the year. McIlroy went on to win a sixth Race to Dubai but he would have swapped that for a fifth major.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nHow refreshing it was to see the Old Course played as the test it was meant to be when the AIG Women's Open arrived at St Andrews in August. Lydia Ko's long range and championship winning approach to the famous 17th was among the shots of the year, as she ended an eight-year drought in the majors.

{"context": "'Everything is so hard' - Amorim searches for answers at Man Utd\n\nManchester United have won just two of six Premier League games under Amorim\n\nCould life at Manchester United get any more dispiriting? They have just lost 3-0 at home to \"little\" Bournemouth, as described by Cherries owner Bill Foley, for the second season running, a result that means they will spend Christmas 13th in the table. It is the first time they have been in the bottom half at this stage since the pre-Premier League days. Their fans – who booed Ruben Amorim's team off at the final whistle – are so upset at the imposition of a ticket price rise to a flat £66 with no concessions that they are joining forces with fellow supporters at bitter rivals Liverpool to protest when the two sides meet at Anfield on 5 January. Just as Amorim was telling the media he felt fans were \"tired\" in his post-match press conference, a leak from the ceiling led to water running onto journalists on the front row, forcing one of them to move. While many fans will be quite happy to learn of journalists covering their club getting a soaking, as a public farce it takes some beating. But for Amorim, United's position is no laughing matter. Defender Lisandro Martinez told Match of the Day the on-field situation makes him \"angry\". His boss has to find some answers. \"In this moment, everything is so hard,\" said Amorim. \"At a club like Manchester United, to lose 3-0 at home, it's really tough for everybody. \"Of course the fans are really disappointed and tired. You can feel it in the stadium in the first play. At the first goal-kick with Andre Onana, he's thinking what to do and pushing the other guys and everybody is so anxious. \"I understand that, but we have to face it.\"\n\nRuben Amorim has overseen three defeats in his six Premier League games so far\n\nIf there is a significant difference introduced by the Portuguese in the short time since he replaced Erik ten Hag last month, it is that United have more control ", "continuation": "in matches. Their possession stats are high, with 60% today. United had more shots and more shots on target than Bournemouth. But they lost, badly, again. For only the second time in their history - the other being against Burnley in the 1960s - they have lost successive home games against the same opposition by a three-goal margin. It would help significantly if they didn't keep conceding goals at set-pieces. It happened twice at Arsenal earlier this month and against Nottingham Forest in their last home game. At Tottenham on Thursday, Son Heung-min scored direct from a corner. Bournemouth managed it in the first half, even though manager Andoni Iraola admitted afterwards his is \"not a tall team\". Nevertheless, when Ryan Christie floated over a free-kick from the right touchline, teenage defender Dean Huijsen easily shrugged off the attentions of Joshua Zirkzee and flicked a header into the far corner. They were not all under Amorim's watch, clearly, but United have now conceded 17 goals from set-pieces in the Premier League in 2024, their most in a single calendar year in the competition. The recent mishaps do beg the question, what is set piece coach Carlos Fernandes, who accompanied Amorim from Sporting, actually doing?\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Amorim 'always expected' Man Utd job to be difficult.\n\nNot that Amorim is apportioning blame. \"The responsibility is on me, not Carlos,\" he said. \"We are a team in good moments and bad moments. We have a way of doing things. We are working on that and we are going to improve on that. But we didn't lose because of set pieces. We lost because we create more chances and didn't score.\" Speaking to Match of the Day, Martinez put it rather more bluntly. \"We are so angry with this kind of situation,\" said the Argentina defender. \"We have to work on set-pieces especially. \"I believe a lot in this team and staff. If they don't score their first goal from a set-piece then it is a totally different game.\" Amorim is hampered by a lack of quality. The Portuguese trusted Tyrell Malacia with the left wing-back role, but took the Dutchman off at half-time having watched him give the ball away too cheaply on too many occasions and not really offer anything going forward. Diogo Dalot switched sides, but his one goal threat lacked conviction. Noussair Mazraoui moved to left wing-back from his position in a three-man defence, but was drawn into the rash tackle on Justin Kluivert which allowed the forward to double Bournemouth's lead from the penalty spot. Further forward, only skipper Bruno Fernandes was a danger to the Bournemouth goal, with Marcus Rashford omitted for the third successive game, although he was at Old Trafford to watch the sorry events unfold. \"It depends, we will see,\" said Amorim when asked if the England forward might come into contention for the Boxing Day trip to Wolves."}

Claire Roberts was one of five children whose deaths at hospitals in Northern Ireland were examined by the 14-year-long inquiry. It was heavily critical of a health service it deemed to be \"self-regulating and unmonitored\". Mr Roberts said \"the public will be shocked to find there is no legal binding duty on a doctor to tell a patient when there have been failures or when they've been at fault\".\n\nThe human rights commissioner said there had to be a criminal sanction when something significant had gone wrong that could lead to death or serious harm. “Up until now a duty of candour has been a moral obligation and there’s been no sanction attached to it,\" said Alyson Kilpatrick. \"I know there are disciplinary codes that require you (staff) to be open and honest with the patient, but who knows what that means. \"This is turning what is the right thing to do into the legal thing to do.\n\nAlyson Kilpatrick said something had to give\n\n“We have numerous inquiries, but nothing has changed in practice or in the law that’s made a difference “I do wonder why there seems to be something emotive about attaching the word criminal to it (duty of candour). \"It is unlikely people are going to end up in prison - but if somebody has deliberately failed to notify a serious adverse incident resulting in death, maybe that has to be a sanction that is available – it is a very, very serious failure.”\n\nThe recently published Infected Blood Inquiry report, external, external coupled with the ongoing evidence at the Horizon Post Office Inquiry, external, external have ignited debate about the principle of candour and why institutions including the health and civil service appear to close ranks during scandals. While there is a professional and moral duty on staff to do that, several public inquiries have found significant failings where information was deliberately withheld. Mr Roberts questioned why money was spent on public inquiries if lessons were not learned. \"It's a very defensive and toxic system. It's totally frustrating for us, we've been through enough, we lost our daughter, and we are having to fight for some sort of change within our health system and it's not progressing,\" he said.\n\nMr Roberts said the Department of Health had been “dragging its feet” in implementing a duty of candour. He said an honest doctor had “nothing to fear from being open and honest with their patients”. Health Minister Mike Nesbitt said the question was how to create a \"regime that minimises the chill factor that deters individuals from being candid, and maximises willingness and responsibility to engage in an honest review of what went wrong\". \"I wish to assess the impact defined sanctions is likely of have on that balance,\" he said.\n\nHowever, the British Medical Association said the concept was unworkable and the Department of Health in Northern Ireland got it wrong when it linked sanctions with duty of candour in the same sentence in a 2021 consultation. Dr Alan Stout from the BMA in Northern Ireland, said there should be criminal sanction if there is criminal activity, but linking it inextricably with a duty of candour threatened how doctors carried out their normal jobs. “It hasn’t worked because the initial plans were all wrong and that was linking that complete sentence of duty of candour with criminal sanction,\" said Dr Stout. \"It will never work, and we will go backwards rapidly if we continue with that full sentence. \"But if we work together with an individual duty of candour and an organisational duty of candour, we can absolutely make it work.\"\n\nThe infected blood inquiry chair, Sir Brian Langstaff, has called for a statutory duty of candour to be imposed on civil servants as well as healthcare leaders in the wake of his findings. The first recommendation, which Justice O’Hara listed in his 2018 hyponatraemia report, was for a statutory duty of candour to be enacted in Northern Ireland – to put a legal requirement of honesty on those working in the healthcare system. The senior judge said this should apply where \"death or serious harm has been or may have been caused to a patient\" and that \"criminal liability should attach to breach of this duty\". However, both the BMA and the General Medical Council (GMC) oppose this."}

For Gareth Southgate, see Jos Buttler and Matthew Mott. England’s semi-final defeat by India in Guyana was emphatic. It brought an end to their reign as T20 World Cup champions. In many ways it told us what we already knew – that England struggle on slow, low pitches and their bowling attack is not quite at the elite level. But at the same time this tournament leaves unanswered questions, namely, are England any good and are Mott and Buttler the right leaders to take them back to the top of the white-ball game? That those doubts remain is a problem for the coach and captain.\n\nJust days ago it felt like England had turned a corner. It seemed their leadership duo had wriggled free of the ghosts of last year’s disappointing defence of the 50-over World Cup. A run to the semi-final", "continuation": "s would have been viewed as a decent effort in another world. But defeat by 68 runs brings those demons back into view, especially in a tournament where three of your four wins came against Namibia, Oman and the United States. Now, for the first time in five years, England do not hold a white-ball trophy. England's managing director of men's cricket Rob Key must decide whether there has been enough from Buttler and Mott to remain for the next one - the Champions Trophy in Pakistan in February. Buttler’s case is strengthened by the lack of alternatives. Harry Brook is the only realistic candidate of a suitable age, who is also guaranteed a place in the XI. Some doubt whether the job would suit the 25-year-old, but he has led Yorkshire four times in the T20 Blast and England at an Under-19 World Cup. Captaincy has never seemed to come as naturally to Buttler as it did his predecessor and close friend Eoin Morgan.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nSpeak to those close to Buttler and they insist he is the right man – a calm head with a smart cricket brain who can lead by example as England’s greatest white-ball batter. Big mistakes were made in India last year – decisions at the toss in Mumbai and against Afghanistan and bizarre switches in team selection – and Buttler’s call to give part-timer Will Jacks the second over against Australia in this tournament, a move he described as being a “gut” feeling at the time, was another. But he also deserves credit for other moves here, such as his bowling changes in England’s one impressive win against West Indies. He kept spirits high and his message clear when he fronted up as England’s campaign threatened to end after just two weeks. When England arrived in Antigua that week, with just one point and a huge net run-rate disadvantage to Scotland, they could have crumbled – as they did across 11 days in defeats by Afghanistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka in India last year. That campaign broke at the seams. This one steadied and corrected itself, albeit against poor opposition. Buttler, who led England to the title in 2022 with Mott, probably deserves to choose if he wants to go on.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'India on their way' - Axar removes Bairstow\n\nMott’s position is less certain, simply because head coaches are easier to replace. Key has already tipped one member of Mott’s backroom staff, former all-rounder Andrew Flintoff, as a future candidate for the main job, external. Ex-England batter Jonathan Trott has done his standing no harm by leading Afghanistan to the semi-finals. The task ahead of Mott is also not the one he was brought in to do. When he took charge, Morgan was captain and England’s white-ball team supreme. Mott was asked to repeat what he had achieved with the Australia women's side - keep them at the top of the game in a prolonged period of dominance. His England team is now in need of a refresh to build towards the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka in 2026 and the 50-over showpiece a year later in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia. Chris Jordan and Moeen Ali, aged 35 and 36 respectively, are the most obvious members of this squad to be thanked and moved on. Moeen said last year he did not think he should be part of the 50-over set-up going forward. A difficult decision is looming over 34-year-old Jonny Bairstow, who batted well at times but managed only 23 runs combined in his innings against Australia, South Africa and India. The selection of this summer's Test squad was pushed until after this World Cup in case it required an awkward conversation. Should Bairstow not get picked to play West Indies on 10 July, it is not impossible the Yorkshireman has played his last international. England have to hope leg-spinner Adil Rashid does not follow his mate Moeen into the sunset. His 10 wickets at an average of 19 and an economy below seven here show he remains one of the best in the world aged 36. He, Buttler, who will be 36 at the next T20 World Cup, and Archer should be the core going forward, along with younger men in Brook and Phil Salt. After that, a cupboard that once had Alex Hales, Dawid Malan and Sam Billings on the outside looks a little bare. Had a batter got injured in this tournament, the uncapped Tom Kohler-Cadmore, 29, would have been one of the next in line. England’s famed white-ball depth is not what it once was. Their next limited-overs series begins in September, one day after the third Test against Sri Lanka ends. By its end, the Test players will be leaving for Pakistan. Naturally there will be changes and last year’s list of central contracts give a clue to the bowlers who could come in. Expect fast bowlers Gus Atkinson and Brydon Carse, the latter will by then have served a three-month ban for betting offences, to feature in future squads, plus Hampshire quick John Turner. Whether Mott stays to make those calls remains to be seen. If you came here looking for definitive answers, I apologise. Perhaps that is part of the problem.\n• None Get cricket news sent straight to your phone"}

{"context": "European retailers are rushing to place their Christmas orders early as soaring shipping costs and trade route disruption threaten holiday deliveries, experts say. For the last few months, vessels belonging to Western firms have been attacked in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels backing Hamas in its war with Israel, driving shipping prices up. Container prices, which peaked in January and briefly declined, have rebounded sharply in recent weeks. One business told the BBC that increased costs were likely to feed through to the price of big-ticket items such as white goods.\n\nNick Glynn, boss of the Buy It Direct group, owns several online retailers including Appliances Direct and Laptops Direct, which are having to plan and book well in advance to make sure their shipments arrive on time. Because they are planning ahead, he said he didn't think Black Friday and Christmas stock would be affected. But he said: \"It impacts cash and warehouse space as suddenly you have to store the goods for longer. You can't risk ordering later.\" Mr Glynn explained that the spot rate - the current price for immediate delivery of goods - has dramatically increased in recent weeks from $4,500 to $7,500 (£3,500 to £5,900). \"This makes a massive impact on big bulky items, especially those that have low margins such as furniture, barbecues, and kitchen appliances,\" he said. There was \"no way\" most online retailers could absorb those price increases on big-ticket items, he said. \"So unfortunately for consumers, the next few months will see significant rises on these big-ticket items,\" he added.\n\nDisruptions caused", "continuation": " by Yemen's Houthi movement have limited the global supply of shipping space and containers. The Houthi rebels have already launched attacks on more than 50 ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.\n\nGlobal shipping routes have been disrupted by the attacks on vessels in the Red Sea\n\nShipping costs have soared as a result. The average cost of shipping a 40ft container now exceeds $4,000, a 140% increase from 2023, according to freight market tracker Xeneta. Peter Sand, Xeneta's chief analyst, said that importers have learned many lessons from the pandemic including that \"the most straightforward way to protect supply chains is to ship as many of your goods as you can as quickly as possible\". \"That is what we are seeing with some businesses telling us they are already shipping cargo for the Christmas period - in May,\" he said. Typically, retailers start importing goods for the November Black Friday sales and Christmas shopping season between late summer and autumn. Sue Terpilowski, from the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, agreed, saying companies are realising that disruption to the Red Sea route caused by Houthi attacks could last until the autumn. \"To avoid headlines 'Christmas is cancelled, there's nothing in the shops', people are now actually bringing forward their shipments,\" she said. \"So they'll be here in good time allowing any eventualities that might happen while they are at sea.\"\n\nThe attacks on ships have forced owners of vessels travelling between Asia and Europe to take a longer route around Africa, and so ships are starting their journeys earlier to allow for the extra time needed for the diversion. \"The effects of the diversions from the Red Sea that started last December are only now becoming apparent, with vessels on the Asia-Europe trade needing more than 100 days on a rotation by circumventing Africa,\" said Dominique Nadelhofer, from Kuehne + Nagel, a major sea logistics firm. He added that the rotation of container equipment has also been disrupted, and said only around 50% of global container shipping is currently completed on time. As well as concerns about potential future Houthi attacks, there are also growing fears that as naval forces focus on countering the Houthi rebels, the resulting reduction in maritime patrols elsewhere may provide Somali pirates with opportunities to increase their activities."}
{"context": "Iga Swiatek has lifted the French Open trophy in four of the past five years\n\nIga Swiatek achieved the rare feat of winning a third successive French Open women's title with a comprehensive victory over Italian 12th seed Jasmine Paolini. Poland’s Swiatek continued her recent dominance on the Roland Garros clay with a 6-2 6-1 win against first-time major finalist Paolini. The world number one trailed by an early break but instantly hit back, winning 11 of the next 12 games to secure victory. It has secured 23-year-old Swiatek a fourth title in Paris and a fifth Grand Slam triumph overall after her victory at the 2022 US Open. \"I love this place, I wait every year to play here,\" said Swiatek, who won in just 68 minutes. Swiatek follows Monica Seles and Justine Henin into the record books as the only players to have claimed a ‘three-peat’ in the women’s singles since the Open era began in 1968. She is the youngest player in the Open era - which ushered in professionalism - to win four titles at Roland Garros. After sealing victory in little over an hour, Swiatek celebrated by sinking to her knees before dancing around the court.

Ultimately, nobody was able to provide an answer. Along with her formidable history at Roland Garros she arrived in hot form, having already won prestigious WTA titles in Madrid and Rome. Former world number one Naomi Osaka came closest to beating Swiatek, troubling her with powerful returning and holding a match point in their second-round encounter before the top seed recovered. Since then it has been plain sailing for Swiatek. A 40-minute ‘double bagel’ over Anastasia Potapova in the fourth round laid down a significant marker, before she dropped just two games against 2019 finalist Marketa Vondrousova in the quarter-finals. US Open champion Coco Gauff offered more resistance in the semi-finals before Swiatek asserted control against an opponent she has dominated in their previous meetings. Few people gave Paolini hope of causing what would have been an almighty shock. After a sloppy start, Swiatek found her rhythm, crushing Paolini in a devastating performance which showcased her ability and authority on the red dirt. The statistics also underline it:\n• None Swiatek has won 21 matches in a row at the French Open - the fourth longest streak in women's singles in the Open era\n• None Swiatek has won 35 of her 37 career matches at Roland Garros\n• None She has not lost in Paris since 2021\n• None After saving match point against Osaka, Swiatek won 64 of 81 games on her way to the title\n• None Only Chris Evert (seven), Steffi Graf (six) and Justine Henin (four) have won more French Open titles than the Pole\n• None Swiatek dropped the fewest games in a French Open final since Henin beat Ana Ivanovic in 2007\n\nPaolini’s run to the final has been the culmination of a fine season where she has registered several career milestones and climbed into the world’s top 10. Pre-match odds on the 28-year-old causing an upset were about 11-1, but the underdog, who was well supported by a crowd containing lots of Italians, began confidently. Looking unfazed, Paolini was able to use her forehand to good effect and there was a murmur of surprise around the stadium when she deservedly broke for a 2-1 lead. But Swiatek, whose long miss on break point was illustrative of her lack of precision, instantly replied. She broke straight back to love as Paolini could not consolidate, with the Italian handing over another break for 4-2 with a double fault. From that point it was one-way traffic.

Britain's two-time Olympic 1500m champion published his manifesto, external on Thursday morning alongside those of the other six candidates in the running to succeed Thomas Bach next year. \"Innovation is critical, we have to be open to new ideas,\" he told BBC Sport. Coe has vowed to shake up the IOC, claiming \"too much power is in the hands of too few people\". Describing the election as \"the dance I just couldn't sit out\", Coe said: \"The question I ask myself as a member is - 'what input do I and other members have?' \"And the reality of it is, there isn't enough. I'm not sure we're making the most of the extraordinary talent that sits alongside me. The IOC is not a broken organisation but it can be so much better and it needs change.\" In his proposals, Coe reinforces previous pledges to boost youth sport, introduce \"clear, science-based policies\" to protect the female category amid continuing debate in sport over gender eligibility rules, and to listen to athletes. He also says that: \"To sustain the Games we must grow - not just financially but also in reach and relevance. Commercial partners and broadcasters want modernisation.\" Speaking a", "continuation": "t the Olympic Park in Stratford, Coe - who chaired the organising committee of London 2012 - added: \"Climate change is going to fundamentally make us have to think about the global calendar, where we take our events and the times of the year that we take our events. \"And some people have even suggested that we might want to look at the balance between the winter and summer Games. \"You have venues where some sports are indoors. You could in theory take them into another time of the year, maybe a winter Games. \"So these are all the things that I would encourage debate to take place on, because only when we have that debate can we discard the things that may not work. \"Only in collaboration with the winter sports and all those organisations out there. We have the Association of National Olympic Committees. We have the summer federations that are represented, and some of that has to be a collaborative approach. But I think we should always be open to new and fresh thinking.\" Last year the IOC said research showed only 10 countries will be able to host snow sports by 2040 because of the impact of climate change, and accepted \"a need to adapt the Olympic Winter Games\". There are currently four indoor sports at the Winter Olympics: speed skating, figure skating, curling, and ice hockey. In a controversial move, World Athletics introduced prize money for gold medallists at Paris 2024 under Coe's leadership. \"Many of the things I've done at World Athletics have sparked a debate,\" he said. \"That's not something I shy away from. In a world that changes every five minutes, we have to be very open to analysis that doesn't always fit comfortably with how we see the world. And we should embrace that.\" Coe vowed to avoid a repeat of this summer's Olympic boxing controversy when two athletes disqualified from the previous year's World Championships for allegedly failing gender eligibility criteria - Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting - won gold medals after being allowed to compete by the IOC. Both have insisted they are women. \"On the female category, it was non-negotiable [to include it in the manifesto],\" Coe said. \"If you don't have clear policies, you end up with where you got to in Paris. The comforting thing for me is that it could not have happened in athletics.\" Under Coe, World Athletics has banned transgender women from competing in the female category at international events and toughened the rules over the participation of competitors with differences in sex development (DSD).\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Olympics scheduling will have to be more flexible - Samaranch\n\nCoe faces competition from Spaniard Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr, France's David Lappartient, Zimbabwean Kirsty Coventry, Japan's Morinari Watanabe, Swede Johan Eliasch and Prince Feisal al Hussein of Jordan for the IOC presidency. Samaranch - whose late father was in charge of the IOC for 21 years until 2001 - says his core mission is to protect the universality of the Olympics. He also says the IOC \"has a fundamental duty to safeguard women's sport by adopting a policy to maintain unambiguous distinctions between men and women's categories\". Samaranch - who is an IOC vice-president - defended the organisation's role in the Paris boxing controversy, saying: \"Things can always be handled better, but I really think that was a very difficult situation. \"At the end of the day we were talking about two athletes who had a long career as women athletes, that were born women, that had been educated women, that had competed in World Championships and previous Olympics as women. \"So we defended their right to participate, and we had to stick to our guns.\" He told BBC Sport the traditional summer Olympics may have to be held in the northern hemisphere winter in future, insisting: \"We're going to have to be more flexible in scheduling the dates at which the Games can happen.\" When asked if he would be open to the event being held in Saudi Arabia - which is hosting the men's World Cup in 2034 - the IOC vice-president said: \"If I'm true to my claim for universality, we have to be universal also in the regions of the world that can organise the Games. \"Even if [we] go into the winter, we cannot say to more than one billion people in parts of the world that are too warm to hold the Games during the summer 'sorry, you're out'. We cannot. Honestly, I think it's not fair. \"Since the climate is not going to adapt itself to our calendars, we will have to adapt our calendar to the weather.\" Both members of the IOC executive board, Samaranch and Prince Feisal have promised to empower members and pledged to raise the retirement age for them from 70 to 75 years. Japanese candidate Watanabe, who is president of the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG), has proposed staging the Olympics across five cities from five continents at the same time. The IOC has had no female president and just nine men leading it in its 130-year history."}

And they set a tone, a framework and dividing lines with political opponents too. Whisper it, but I quite like to collect them. I have old ones from years gone by on my bookshelves at home. They are political history preserved in glossy paper, and a constant reference point, for at least five years, for victorious and losing parties alike.\n\nThe 2024 Conservative manifesto, external is a 76-page tome which has the desire and the instinct for tax cuts as its controlling thought. But hang on: cuts in national insurance and stamp duty get the thumbs-up, but there is no equivalent on income tax or inheritance tax. The argument goes that as sought after as these might be by many, they are less of a priority than the other two. And there is a pattern here, as you can see when you look at the Tory promise on borders and security. Rishi Sunak renews his commitment to the Conservative plan to send some of those arriving over the Channel on small boats to Rwanda. But look what is not promised: the one thing some reckon would make it more likely this scheme and others like it would work — withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Instead, there is a rather fudgey formulation in the manifesto, on page 36. It reads: \"If we are forced to choose between our security and the jurisdiction of a foreign court, including the ECHR, we will always choose our security.\"\n\nIn short this is a manifesto in Rishi Sunak’s image. Not surprising really, you might say, he is the Conservative leader and fair point — but let me flesh out what I mean. It feels like a document that encapsulates what you might call Sunakian Conservatism. His allies would say the fundamentals of that are deliverable, pragmatic, thought-through ideas, not flashy for their own sake but sensible. His critics within the party are already saying they are insufficiently bold, grabby or game-changey - when a game-changer is so desperately needed, if even possible. \"Doubt any of this will make a blind bit of difference,\" one senior Tory texts me. Before adding, \"Should have gone for a tax cut that would have some cut through. These won’t. ECHR language is completely pointless. It is unreformable and we should be leaving.\" A final thought: there is an undercurrent to public utterances and social media adverts from the Conservatives now, to match their private musings. It is an undercurrent which acknowledges the possibility, even the likelihood of defeat. That is not to say for a moment they are giving up - we are three weeks into this campaign with the three most important weeks still to come. But a framing is emerging from the Tories which acknowledges maximising Conservative support may be about minimising a Labour victory, not preventing it."}
{"context": "Where do England need to improve to beat All Blacks?\n\nMarcus Smith started his first game at fly-half for England since their World Cup warm-up defeat by Wales in August\n\nEngland started their Summer Series with a comfortable 52-17 victory over Eddie Jones' Japan in hot and humid Tokyo conditions. The Brave Blossoms dominated the early exchanges but failed to take their chances and were punished by England, who ran in four tries in each half. Lock Charlie Ewels was sent off in the second half for a dangerous clearout and England's attack lacked cohesion at times. But the performance did have plenty of positives, with fly-half Marcus Smith impressing before the two-Test series against New Zealand in July. So what needs to improve to defeat the All Blacks and secure a first away win in New Zealand since 2003?\n\nJones' first game back in charge of Japan started perfectly when his side took an early lead through a penalty from Seungsin Lee. The Brave Blossoms' high attacking tempo caused England plenty of problems in the opening quarter, but Japan were unable to convert numerous try-scoring opportunities. During this year's Six Nations England trailed at half-time in each of their five matches and that will have to change against the All Blacks. One of New Zealand's biggest strengths is to blow teams away with quick tries, as shown in their World Cup quarter-final victory over Ireland when they raced into a 13-point lead after the opening quarter. \"The focus will be starting the game better in New Zealand,\" former England wing Chris Ashton told BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra. \"Japan controlled the start but didn't take their chances, that won't happen against the All Blacks.\"\n\nEngland defence coach Felix Jones, who helped coach the Springboks to back-to-back World Cups, helped deploy a successful blitz-system during his first Six Nations campaign. The system took time to embed and early mistakes were exploited, but things clicked in round four as Ireland's potent attack was well managed in England's victory at Twickenham. The Brave Blossoms fielded a young side and their inexperience showed with their failure to convert their initial breaks, although England's scramble defence on their own line showed plenty of heart in stopping them. Japan finally scored two late tries as they took advantage of England's fatigue and changing line-up. New Zealand's backline is full of World Cup finalists who only need half a chance, so England's defence will need to be water-tight for the full 80 minutes of both Tests. Keeping a full complement of players will also be vital if Borthwick's side are to win in New Zealand for the first time since 2003. Their discipline has improved since three red cards across the World Cup warm-up matches and opening pool victory over Argentina, but in addition to Ewels' red for a dangerous clearout tackle, Smith was sent to the sin-bin for an illegal tackle. \"We will need to go up several levels and I expect us to go up several levels when we face New Zealand,\" Borthwick said. \"As will the discipline. You can’t give that many penalties away, we know that. You also can't give New Zealand the space we gave Japan.\"\n\nEngland were often criticised during the World Cup and the start of this year’s Six Nations for not producing enough cutting edge in attack. There appeared to be a shift in approach in the win o", "continuation": "ver Ireland and that fluency continued against France, but Marcus Smith was tasked with leading the attack from fly-half in Tokyo with the injured George Ford unavailable. Smith ran, passed and kicked with aplomb against Japan, albeit a side including four debutants. His try followed a move indicative of an England side trying to play with more creativity. The line-out was thrown long for Ollie Lawrence to charge at the Brave Blossoms, but the ball was moved to Alex Mitchell before the centre took contact. The scrum-half had to adjust slightly to gather possession but he had control in time to feed an onrushing Smith to glide through and sidestep the final defender to score. Highlights of the try showed the camera pan to England attack coach Richard Wigglesworth shouting \"Go Marcus!\" in a move he had influence on drawing up. Smith then turned provider, first with a delayed pass to allow Immanuel Feyi-Waboso to cross in the corner before launching a cross-field kick against the run of play for Henry Slade to gather and score. Smith has seemingly been given licence to play what is in front of him, kicking to score tries rather than the formerly favoured kicking for territory. England will have to show creativity if they are to penetrate the All Blacks' stout defence, and Smith has shown signs that he is up to the challenge."}

{"context": "The results are a personal blow to Mr Modi, who has never fallen short of a majority\n\nIndian PM Narendra Modi has won a third consecutive term in a much tighter general election than anticipated. His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) looks set to fall short of a majority and is leading in the 543-seat parliament, below the required 272 seats. However its coalition partners have gained additional seats. The results are a personal blow to Mr Modi, who has always secured majorities in elections as both chief minister of Gujarat state and India’s prime minister, and dominated the country's politics for a decade. The verdict marks a surprising revival for the Congress Party-led INDIA opposition alliance, defying earlier predictions of its decline, and sharply diverging from both exit polls and pre-election surveys. More than 640 million people voted in a marathon seven-week election, hailed as a \"world record\" by election authorities. Nearly half of the voters were women.\n\nThe opposition has staged a remarkable comeback under Rahul Gandhi\n\nMany world leaders have crawled across the finishing line in their third term elections and Mr Modi is no exception. The BJP remains India’s single largest party by seats, and if Mr Modi secures a third term with his allies, the prime minister matches the record of Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first premier. But the significant loss of seats for his party - more than 50 - dims the allure of a third term, especially given Mr Modi's campaign targeting 400 coalition seats, making anything less seem like an under-achievement. This has led to jubilation in the Congress camp and some despair in BJP quarters. Despite the BJP emerging as the single largest party, the burden of hype and expectations has left many of their supporters disheartened. Mr Modi's supporters believe securing a third term can be attributed to several factors: a record of stable governance, the appeal of continuity, efficient welfare programmes, and the perception that he has enhanced India's global image. To his Hindu nationalist base, Mr Modi delivered on key manifesto promises: revoking the autonomy of Indian-administered Kashmir, building the Ram temple in Ayodhya and implementing a controversial citizenship law. Many BJP-ruled states have implemented laws tightening regulations on interfaith marriages.\n\nMr Modi appealed to his Hindu nationalist base by building the Ram temple in Ayodhya\n\nThe BJP's significant drop in seats may be linked to joblessness, rising prices, growing inequality and a controversial army recruitment reform, among other things. Mr Modi's harsh and divisive campaign, particularly targeting Muslims, could also have alienated voters in some regions. His ambitious slogan \"Ab ki baar, 400 paar,\" aiming for more than 400 seats for his NDA alliance, may have backfired, with such a massive majority raising fears of constitutional changes among the poor. Mr Modi’s party faced its largest setback in Uttar Pradesh (UP), a state larger than the United Kingdom and three times as populous. With 80 parliamentary seats, UP holds significant sway in national politics - many consider it the gateway to Delhi. Both Mr Modi and Rahul Gandhi hold seats there.\n\nThe election results show that Brand Modi has lost some of its shine\n\nSo what are the main takeaways of this election? Mr Modi’s popularity has been also attributed to his mastery of branding, transforming routine events into spectacles and astute messaging. A weak opposition and a largely friendly media also helped him build his brand. The election results show that Brand Modi has lost some of its shine, indicating that even Mr Modi is susceptible to anti-incumbency. In other words, he is not as invincible as many of his supporters believed. This offers renewed hope to the opposition. India has a history of chaotic coalition governments, although some in the early 1990s and 2000s played a significant role in implementing economic reforms. If the BJP forms the government, it will be dependent on allies and will need to adopt a more consultative and deliberative ap", "continuation": "proach. This dependency makes it vulnerable to collapse if allies feel neglected. The party, once perceived as all-powerful, is now reliant on allies, unlike in 2014 and 2019.\n\nAkhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi have forged a successful coalition in Uttar Pradesh\n\nMr Modi's uninterrupted decade-long reign at the top has underscored India's embrace of what some political scientists term the one-party dominant system. This has five key traits: a charismatic leader, unrivaled control over resources and communication, unmatched organisational machinery, and an opposition in disarray. Shrinking freedoms also characterise a one-party dominant system. Mr Modi’s BJP is not the first party to dominate Indian politics. For many years after Independence the Congress ruled without a break. Tuesday’s result has restored India to what many consider \"normal politics\", with a range of parties sharing and competing for power.\n\nN Chandrababu Naidu's regional TDP is an ally of Mr Modi\n\nThe results will energise the much-criticised Congress-led opposition. In February, the diverse coalition known as INDIA, short for Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, faced turmoil when one of its key leaders, Nitish Kumar, exited - only to later rejoin the BJP. But led by Rahul Gandhi, the opposition ran a spirited campaign and narrowed the gap, in the face of a partisan media and despite fewer resources. There is more hope for them ahead. The BJP holds about a third of India’s 4,000- plus state assembly seats and has lost to regional parties before. Over the next 14 months, five states are set for elections - all could be keenly contested. With contests in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, and Haryana this year, the BJP could face substantial competition. Delhi's upcoming election may pose challenges, while Bihar in October presents a regional hurdle.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. What worked for India's Modi and what didn’t?\n\nSo what could a potential third term for Mr Modi mean? India needs much more work and some healing. The economy, fueled by government spending, is on the upswing. Yet inequality is rising. Private investment and consumption must increase, and the poor and the middle class will need more money in their pockets to spend more. That will not happen if there are not enough jobs. In a country bristling with ambition and frustration, younger voters are likely to drift from the BJP – around two-fifths of India’s billion-plus people are under 25. Mr Modi has drawn criticism for marginalising Muslims, India’s largest minority, who have borne the brunt of violence. His government faces accusations of stifling dissent, with leading opposition figures jailed on what they say are trumped-up charges. But third terms have often proved to be rocky for many leaders, with unforeseen and unpredictable events blowing governments and their plans off course."}
{"context": "Asmahan al-Masri and 15 relatives live at a camp in Khan Younis, feet away from piles of rubbish\n\nAcross the Gaza Strip, in a landscape newly transformed by war, mountains of stinking rubbish pose severe dangers to health and the environment. “We’ve never lived next to rubbish before,” says Asmahan al-Masri, a displaced woman, originally from Beit Hanoun in the north, whose home is now a wasteland in Khan Younis. “I cry just like any other grandmother would over her grandchildren being sick and having scabies. This is like a slow death. There is no dignity.” In eight months, more than 330,400 tonnes of solid waste are estimated to have built up in the Palestinian territory, according to the UN and humanitarian agencies working on sanitation. Sixteen members of the Masri family share a tent in a camp near al-Aqsa University with clouds of flies and sometimes snakes. Stray dogs can roam menacingly nearby. All the residents complain of the constant stench. “The smell is very disturbing. I keep my tent door open so that I can get some air, but there is no air,” Asmahan says. “Just the smell of rubbish.”\n\nDesperation across Gaza is forcing many, like Mohamed, to scavenge for something to eat, use or sell\n\nSome of the more than one million people who recently fled Israel’s military offensive in the southern city of Rafah have been forced to live in open areas that had already been turned into temporary refuse tips. “We searched everywhere for a suitable place, but we are 18 people with our children and grandchildren, and we couldn’t find anywhere else where we could stay together,” says Ali Nasser, who recently moved to the al-Aqsa University campsite from his home in Rafah. “The journey here cost us over 1,000 shekels ($268; £212) and now our finances are destroyed. We have no jobs, no income, and so we are forced to live in this dire situation. We suffer from vomiting, diarrhoea, and constantly itchy skin.”\n\n\"There is no air,\" says Asmahan, \"just the smell of rubbish\"\n\nBefore the war, years of blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt on Gaza, which was governed by Hamas, had put a severe strain on basic services, such as waste disposal. The tight restrictions for what Israel said were security reasons on what could enter the territory meant there were insufficient rubbish trucks, a lack of equipment for sorting and recycling household waste and for disposing of it correctly. Since the deadly 7 October Hamas-led attacks, Israel’s military has blocked access to the border area, which is where Gaza’s two main landfill sites are located. One in Juhr al-Dik previously served the north, and another, in al-Fukhari, served the central and southern areas. “We’re seeing a waste management crisis in Gaza, and one that has got a lot worse over the past few months,” says Sam Rose, director of planning for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa.\n\nGazans face the risk of disease with sewage water accumulating close to makeshift shelters\n\nSocial media footage compiled by BBC Verify shows temporary waste dumps have grown as people have fled in waves to different towns and cities.

Satellite analysis by BBC Verify has previously shed a light on another aspect of sanitation problems, showing half of Gaza’s water and sewage treatment sites have been damaged or destroyed since Israel began its military action against Hamas. “You see massive pools of grey-brown sludge around which people are living because they have no choice, and you see large piles of garbage. Either this is just left outside people’s homes or in some places, people have been forced to move near the temporary landfills that have been set up,” Mr Rose says. “People are literally living amongst the garbage.” The mass displacement of people has overwhelmed local authorities often dealing with damaged facilities because of the ongoing Israeli bombardment. They complain of a lack of staff, equipment, and rubbish trucks as well as fuel to run them.\n\nAt the Khan Younis municipality, an official, Omar Matar, expresses regret over the appalling conditions for those now living near al-Aqsa University. “These random dumps do not meet health and environmental standards. They do not stop the spread of odours, insects, and rodents,” he says. “They were previously created as an emergency measure because of the closure of the Sofa landfill site [at al-Fukhari], until a solution is found with international institutions to transport the waste there,” he explains. A spokesman for the Israeli military body, Cogat, told me it was looking at several different solutions for the Gaza waste problem.\n\nThe campus of Gaza's al-Aqsa university has turned into a temporary landfill site in Khan Younis\n\nThe UN Development Programme says it has recently been involved in collecting 47,000 tonnes of waste from central and southern Gaza and that it has distributed 80,000 litres of fuel for the clean-up effort. But far more needs to be done. Now as summer temperatures soar, there are new warnings from aid agencies about the health hazards posed by so much rubbish. Yet, desperation drives many Gazans to take extra risks: scavenging for something to eat, use or sell. “We got used to the smell. Every day we come here together to look for cardboard boxes and other things that we can burn to make fires,” says Mohammed, one of a group of boys picking over a rubbish dump near Deir al-Balah as it is filled with waste from aid packaging and rudimentary efforts to clear sites hit by Israeli air strikes. Mazad Abu Mila, a displaced man from Beit Lahia, says he is looking for scrap metal that he could use to build a furnace. “We left all our money behind, our shops, our cars, our livestock, our houses. All were left. This is the most dangerous thing for our health. I would never have gone to a rubbish dump before but right now, everyone is coming here.”"}

{"context": "Chris Mason: Why Labour are so keen to talk about defence\n\n“There are two essential tests of trust: money and national security.” I am chatting to a senior Labour figure about why they think shifting perceptions of the party’s attitude to defence is so important. “If we don’t get those things right - economy and defence - why would people bother listening to us on anything else?” In other words, Labour regard defence as a foundational issue. Important, for its own sake, and, they conclude vital if they are going to win. Arguably this has always been the case. But Labour’s leadership team is acutely aware of it now more than ever, because of what came before: the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nTake a look at this – Mr Corbyn’s interview with Andrew Neil on the BBC in 2017. Labour gave the impression, overall, of being equivocal about the UK’s nuclear weapons. Mr Corbyn was a longstanding opponent of them and was tied in knots in his interview about what a Labour government under his leadership would do about them. So the current Labour leadership have been going out of their way to try to shift those perceptions. More than two years ago, Sir Keir Starmer visited Nato headquarters in Brussels, and told the BBC that Jeremy Corbyn had been “wrong” about the defence alliance. Mr Corbyn had long been a critic of the defence all", "continuation": "iance, although pulling out of it was never Labour policy when he was leader. Sir Keir emphasised then that Labour’s commitment to Nato was “unshakeable.” A month later the Labour leader met Nato troops in Estonia. He was back there again just before Christmas last year. Since then, Labour and the Conservatives have been tussling over who can be trusted to fund our armed forces properly. In mid April, on a trip to the BAE Systems factory in Barrow in Furness in Cumbria, where the UK’s nuclear submarines are built, Keir Starmer promised to spend 2.5% of national income on defence “as soon as resources allow”. At the end of April, when the prospect of a summer election will have been swimming around the mind of the prime minister, I reported on his visit to Warsaw and Berlin to talk about defence – and commit to spending 2.5% of national income on it by 2030. That promise outflanked the Labour Party, because it put a timeframe on the promise. Which brings us to this campaign, and Labour’s determination to project a commitment to the military, in the backdrops the party chooses, the candidates it selects and the language it uses. They are talking up the fact that they have 14 ex-military personnel standing for them at this election. The challenge they face is whether people believe this political leopard really has changed its spots. Just eight years ago under Jeremy Corbyn, around a dozen Labour figures who are now frontbenchers under Keir Starmer voted in the Commons, external against maintaining the UK’s nuclear weapons. Among them, the man who could be foreign secretary next month, David Lammy and the woman who could be deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner. It suggests, in their heart of hearts, there are figures who could soon be hugely influential in government, if Labour win, who are at best equivocal or uncomfortable about the UK’s nuclear arsenal, however committed to it they now claim to be. And, with budgets likely to be tight, whoever wins the election, funding the military in a way deemed adequate will come with trade-offs elsewhere."}

Anthony Stocks tried to kill the boy near Ovingdean, close to Brighton, in September 2022. The 54-year-old, from Goring, Oxfordshire, was found guilty of four counts of sexually assaulting a child under 13, causing a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity and rape of a child under 13. He was also found guilty of attempted murder.\n\nThe boy survived the 100ft (30.5m) fall but received severe injuries. The jury heard how Stocks had told the girl about his plan, and she warned her brother. Via pre-recorded interviews, the girl said Stocks would force her to carry out sexual acts. It made her \"frightened\" and \"uncomfortable\" and she ended up telling her brother about \"all of it… in one big go\", she said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Stocks interrogated by police after his arrest\n\nAfterwards her brother would then try to come between Stocks and her when he could, Oxford Crown Court heard. The boy described how he would \"interfere and stop everything - [Stocks] was really upset I think\". The girl said on another day Stocks, referring to her brother, told her: \"I want to get rid of him so we can be alone so [he] doesn't interfere with us.\" She added: \"All I remember is he was going to push him of a cliff.\" The girl said she was \"worried\" and that night warned her brother. The boy said on the day of the attempt on his life he had been on a trip with Stocks, who is known to the family, to see his favourite football club in London, when he was then asked if he wanted to \"go see a view\".\n\nStocks said he took the trip to Ovingdean because it featured in the film Quadrophenia\n\nHe did not remember being pushed, and the last thing he recalled was standing on the edge of the cliff, before waking up in hospital, the court heard. A passer-by told jurors that after the near-fatal fall Stocks sat down and rolled a cigarette. Stocks claimed the visit to the cliff top had been a last-minute change of plan. He said they took a taxi there because it had featured in the film Quadrophenia. He said the boy had “started getting a bit moody”, and that he warned him not to cross a safety fence close to the cliff’s edge.\n\nPolice body-cam footage captured Stocks moments after he had pushed the boy\n\nOn a previous occasion, Stocks took the boy to a quarry to push him into it but changed his mind, the trial heard. The jury was told Stocks was a one-time film extra who had appeared in the Star Wars franchise, along with JK Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. When he was arrested, police found thousands of pornographic pictures and videos on his phone, all of them “legal”, according to his counsel. But the jury raised a number of questions about his internet searches after the defence team had earlier accepted he had viewed films about adults having sex with younger people.\n\nStocks will be sentenced in “due course”, the judge said.\n\nDet Sgt Rachel Jackson, of Thames Valley Police’s child abuse investigation unit, said Stocks had committed \"absolutely horrific and evil offences\". \"Over a period of around three years, Stocks had subjected the girl to sexual abuse and rape, and when the boy became aware of what was happening, Stocks hatched his evil plan to kill him,\" she said \"What then transpired is nothing short of horrifying. \"Stocks took the boy to one of the highest set of cliffs in the area and hurled him from the top, knowing that this would have almost certainly killed him.\" She said he had \"intended to kill the boy to get him out of the way so he could continue his offending against the girl - this failed\". \"He is a very dangerous individual, who had no thought about anybody but himself, to protect himself from prosecution by removing the boy from the equation,\" she continued. \"He has not shown any remorse throughout the course of this investigation. \"I would like to praise both victims for their unbelievable courage and resolve that helped us to bring Stocks", "continuation": " to justice.\" She described the investigation as \"without a doubt one of the worst cases of child abuse that I have investigated\"."}

{"context": "Reform UK has unveiled billionaire property developer - and former Conservative donor - Nick Candy as its treasurer, with the job of raising big money to fight the next general election. It is the latest in a series of announcements by Nigel Farage's party aimed at showing it is serious about winning power. Candy, who is married to Australian singer and actress Holly Valance, who also supports Reform, made his money by buying and renovating properties with his brother Christian. The pair were privately educated, and bought their first property in London in 1995, using a £6,000 loan from their grandmother. They have never disclosed their wealth, but describe themselves as \"self-made billionaires\". The property tycoon was close to former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, donating more than £270,000 to the Conservative Party under his leadership and attending the then-PM's wedding. Now he says Farage could win the next general election - and is promising to raise \"tens of millions\" for Reform UK, telling journalists he will donate a \"seven figure sum\" of his own cash as well. \"This country needs change and I believe the person to make that change is Nigel Farage and I believe he'll be the next prime minister of this country,\" he said as he was unveiled to the cameras at Westminster.\n\nElon Musk has expressed interest in Candy's appointment, amid speculation the billionaire owner of X is looking into offering Farage's party a large donation. Candy said he and Musk exchanged messages following the announcement on Tuesday morning, but the new Reform UK treasurer refused to be drawn on any negotiations. When he was quizzed about the Donald Trump-supporting tycoon, Farage said: \"We don't know anything about Elon Musk other than he is supportive of our position.\" But he joked: \"If people ", "continuation": "offer us money legally, we'll take it.\" Businesses or individuals have to be registered in the UK to donate to a political party, raising questions about how the South African-born US citizen could give money to Reform. Farage denies Reform UK is becoming a party of millionaires and billionaires, saying the fundraising drive is about getting on an \"even financial footing\" with the other main parties. \"If we do that we will achieve extraordinary things,\" he added.\n\nThere has been speculation Elon Musk is looking into donating to Reform UK\n\nAs well as cash, Reform UK has been gaining valuable contacts in Westminster. Last week former Johnson adviser Tim Montgomerie, a veteran Tory commentator who founded the influential Conservative Home website, announced he was defecting to the party, citing immigration as a policy failure he could not forgive. Farage has a patchy record when it comes to high-profile signings. In his former life as UKIP leader he managed to fall out with figures such as TV personality Robert Kilroy-Silk, Tory defector Douglas Carswell and former EU auditor Marta Andreasen, shortly after unveiling them amid much fanfare. But he has also managed to attract wealthy backers in the past, such as insurance tycoon Arron Banks, who bankrolled his Brexit campaign. He is positioning Reform UK as the party for voters hungry for change - a platform Labour won a landslide election victory on just over five months ago. But Sir Keir Starmer's decision to make difficult and unpopular decisions at the start of his premiership, along with a number of unforced errors, has seen Labour's popularity plummet, as Reform's has risen. Reform UK sits comfortably in third place ahead of the Liberal Democrats in national opinion polls, and is narrowing the gap with the two main parties. The fledgling party proved incapable of transforming the size of its support into seats at Westminster in July. The Liberal Democrats won 3.5 million votes and 72 MPs through their highly-targeted campaign, whereas Reform UK picked up just over four million votes, but only five seats. Farage is on a mission to learn from the Lib Dems how to make Westminster's first-past-the-post voting system work for his party. Reform UK's new multi-millionaire chairman Zia Yusuf has taken on the job of \"professionalising\" the party - no easy task when it has attracted so much controversy in its short life with its choice of candidates in particular. Farage has faced questions over James McMurdock, the Reform MP for South Basildon and East Thurrock, who has a spent conviction after assaulting his girlfriend in 2006. The party has said it was aware of the previous conviction when McMurdock was selected as a candidate, and believes \"strongly that people can change their lives\". But Reform UK is pledging to vet candidates more thoroughly ahead of next year's local elections in an attempt to avoid embarrassment. One target is the new mayoral seat in Greater Lincolnshire, where former Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns has been revealed as the party's candidate. Reform has so far been seen largely as a threat to the Conservatives - but on the day after the general election, Farage made their strategy clear when he declared: \"We're coming for Labour\". The big parties will be watching Reform UK's recent flurry of announcements nervously - and wondering whether they can keep this momentum up."}
{"context": "TikTok set to be banned in the US after losing appeal\n\nTikTok's bid to overturn a law which would see it banned or sold in the US from early 2025 has been rejected. The social media company had hoped a federal appeals court would agree with its argument that the law was unconstitutional because it represented a \"staggering\" impact on the free speech of its 170 million US users. But the court upheld the law, which it said \"was the culmination of extensive, bipartisan action by the Congress and by successive presidents\". TikTok says it will now take its fight to the US Supreme Court, the country's highest legal authority. The US wants TikTok sold or banned because of what it says are its owners links to the Chinese state - links TikTok and parent company Bytedance have always denied. The court agreed the law was \"carefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary, and it was part of a broader effort to counter a well-substantiated national security threat posed by the PRC (People's Republic of China).\" But TikTok said it was not the end of its legal fight. \"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement. They added that the law was based on \"inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information\" and a ban would censor US citizens. Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 US Presidential Election may also present a lifeline for the app. Despite unsuccessfully attempting to ban TikTok during his first term in 2020, he said in the run-up to the November elections he would not allow the ban on TikTok to take effect.\n\nTrump will be inaugurated on 20 January - the day after the law says TikTok must be be banned or sold. However, it remains to be seen whether he will follow through on his pre-election vow. Professor James Grimmelmann of Cornell University said the president-elect would be \"swimming upstream to give TikTok a reprieve\". \"The anti-China sentiment in the US Congress is very strong, so there are now substantial constituencies in both parties that want TikTok to be restricted from the US market,\" he told BBC News.\n\nThe court case has been closely watched both by those who use TikTok- and the app's rivals. Tiffany Cianci, a small business advocate and TikTok creator, said she was \"not shocked\" by Friday's decision - but told BBC News she would not be shifting her TikTok content or presence to the platform's rivals, such as Instagram. \"I'm not going to do what they want and take my content to their platforms where it's not as successful where it's more likely to be censored, where I am more likely to have less control over my audience,\" she said. Nonetheless, other platforms are positioning themselves for a post-TikTok social media landscape. Meta, which owns Facebook as well as Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads, has sought to build rivals to TikTok's short form videos within its own apps, and made changes that users have likened to TikTok amid questions over the app's US future. Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at eMarketer, said there would be \"major upheaval\" if a TikTok appeal were to fail at the Supreme Court and a ban was enforced. She said this would be \"benefitting Meta, YouTube and Snap, while hurting content creators and small businesses that rely on the app to make a living.\" But TikTok won't be easily recreated, said Cory Johnson, Chief Market Strategist at Epistrophy Capital Research. Johnson said deep learning models power TikTok's recommendation engine. \"Enabling such complex AI and big data processing at TikTok's immense scale requires a colossal and expensive technical infrastructure,\" Johnson said. He said TikTok's hyper-targeting and China's data laws pose significant risks, and pointed to Elon Musk's alterations to algorithms at his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, as a cautionary tale. In the run-up to the U.S. election, Musk's", "continuation": " political posts received more views than all U.S. political campaign ads on X's disclosure dataset, Johnson said. \"We have very real and very recent experience in America with a social media network tweaking its algorithms to favor certain voices,\" he added."}
{"context": "The French government fell after parliament backed a motion of no-confidence in Prime Minister Michel Barnier on Wednesday\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron will address the nation on Thursday night, a day after Prime Minister Michel Barnier was ousted in a no-confidence vote. The presidency said on Thursday that Barnier had resigned his post, but would remain in office on a caretaker basis with his ministers until a new government was appointed. Names for a new prime minister have been swirling, including Defence Minister Sébastien Lecornu, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau and centrist former presidential candidate François Bayrou. But finding a name that would not immediately be shot down by one of the large parliamentary factions could take some time, as it did in the summer, when former PM Gabriel Attal stayed on as caretaker for two months.\n\nBarnier's government collapsed after MPs voted overwhelmingly in support of the motion against him, just three months after he was appointed by Macron. Wednesday night's vote was the first time a French government had been voted down by parliament in more than 60 years.

A total of 331 voted in support of the motion, far more than the 288 required for it to pass. Barnier presented the resignation of his government after the vote, while the budget which triggered his downfall was automatically withdrawn. As president, Macron is constitutionally unaffected by Barnier's resignation. But many opposition politicians are increasingly open about wanting to force him to resign and call early presidential elections - something Macron has insisted is off the cards.\n\nMarine Le Pen said the \"only dignified solution\" for opposition MPs was to oppose the budget\n\nThe left-wing alliance New Popular Front (NFP), which won the most seats in the parliamentary elections, had previously criticised Macron's decision to appoint centrist Barnier as prime minister over its own candidate. Alongside the far-right National Rally (RN), it deemed Barnier's budget - which included €60bn (£49bn) in deficit reduction - unacceptable. Marine Le Pen, the RN leader, said the budget was \"toxic for the French\". Ahead of the vote, Barnier told the National Assembly that voting him out of office would not solve the country's financial problems. \"We have reached a moment of truth, of responsibility,\" he said, adding that \"we need to look at the realities of our debt\". \"I did not present almost exclusively difficult measures because I wanted to.\" In an interview with French broadcaster TF1 on Wednesday, Le Pen said there was \"no other solution\" than to remove Barnier. Asked about the French president's prospects, she replied: \"I am not asking for the resignation of Emmanuel Macron.\" Many of her allies, however, are increasingly openly hoping they can force him to resign. RN adviser Philippe Olivier told Le Monde the president was “a fallen republican monarch, advancing with his shirt open and a rope around his neck up to the next dissolution [of parliament]”.

{"context": "The US and Ukraine say North Korean troops are fighting Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk region\n\nWhat Haneul remembers most about his time in the North Korean military is the gnawing, continuous hunger. He lost 10kg in his first month of service, due to a diet of cracked corn and mouldy cabbage. Three months into training, he says almost his entire battalion was severely malnourished and needed to be sent to a recovery centre to gain weight. When they were later deployed as front-line guards to the border with South Korea, rice replaced corn. But by the time it reached their bowls, much had been siphoned off by rear units, and the remainder had been cut with sand. Haneul says his unit was among the best-fed, a tactic to stop them defecting to South Korea. But it failed to prevent Haneul. In 2012, he made a death-defying dash across the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) – the strip of land dividing the North from the South. His experience and that of other military defectors helps shed light on the condition of thousands of North Korean troops deployed to the front line in Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\nHaneul was deployed as a border guard in the Demilitarised Zone with South Korea when he defected in 2012\n\nPyongyang has reportedly sent around 11,000 troops to help Russian forces reclaim part ", "continuation": "of its Kursk region taken by Ukraine in a surprise summer offensive. Earlier this week, Seoul, Washington and Kyiv said the soldiers had now entered the fight \"in significant numbers\", and reported the first casualties, with South Korean officials estimating more than 100 had already been killed and more injured. This figure has not been confirmed. However, defectors and other military experts have told the BBC these troops should not be underestimated. According to South Korean intelligence, most belong to the elite Storm Corps unit, and have \"high morale\", but \"lack an understanding of contemporary warfare\". Only the taller, sportier men are selected for the Storm Corps, says defector Lee Hyun Seung, who trained North Korea's special forces in the early 2000s before defecting in 2014. He taught them martial arts, how to throw knives and make weapons out of cutlery and other kitchen utensils. But even though the Storm Corps' training is more advanced than that of regular North Korean units, the soldiers are still underfed and even malnourished. Online videos, reportedly of the troops in Russia, show younger, \"frail\" soldiers, Haneul says. They are a stark contrast to Pyongyang's propaganda videos, where men are seen bursting out of iron chains and smashing blocks of ice with their bare hands. During his entire time in the army, Haneul says he fired only three bullets in a single live-fire training session. The closest he came to combat was when a hungry farmer stumbled into the DMZ looking for vegetables. Haneul says he ignored instructions to \"shoot any intruders\" and let the man go with a warning.\n\nLee Hyun Seung was a special forces trainer in North Korea in the early 2000s\n\nIt is difficult to know how much has changed in the decade since Haneul defected, given the scarcity of information from North Korea. It appears that the country's leader Kim Jong Un has directed much of his limited resources into missiles and nuclear weapons rather than his standing army. But according to another soldier, Ryu Seonghyun, who defected in 2019, the first three years in the military are \"incredibly tough\", even for the special forces. The 28-year-old, who worked as a driver in the air force for seven years, says that during his service, conditions deteriorated and rice gradually disappeared from meals. \"The soldiers are sent into the mountains for days with a small amount of rice, and are told it is part of their survival training.\" Given these troops have been trained to fight in the mountainous Korean Peninsula, the defectors question how well they will adapt to fighting on the flatlands and in the trenches of Kursk. Crucially, the Storm Corps are not a front-line unit. \"Their mission is to infiltrate enemy lines and create chaos deep within enemy territory,\" Ryu says. But, he adds, Kim Jong Un has no alternative to sending special forces, as regular soldiers spend most of their time farming, building or chopping wood. \"Kim Jong Un had to send men who could demonstrate at least a certain level of combat ability, to avoid damaging North Korea's reputation in Russia.\"\n\nRyu says soldiers are sent into the mountains for days with a small amount of rice as part of survival training\n\nThe language barrier seems to have created an additional hurdle. On Sunday, Ukraine's defence intelligence unit said communication issues had resulted in North Korean soldiers accidentally firing on a Russian battalion, killing eight. With these assessments, it could be easy to dismiss the troops as \"cannon fodder\" and a sign of Russian President Vladimir Putin's desperation. But that would be a mistake, the defectors say. Their loyalty to the regime and fighting spirit will count for a lot. \"Most of the soldiers in the Storm Corps come from working-class or farming families, who are highly obedient to the party and will follow orders unquestionably,\" says Haneul, whose father and cousin were in the special forces. Intense, ideological \"brainwashing\" sessions, held every morning, will further ensure they are mentally ready, Lee adds. He believes the North Korean troops \"will become accustomed to the battlefield, learn how to fight the enemy, and find ways to survive\".\n\nAlthough the soldiers will not have been given a choice over whether to be deployed, Ryu thinks many will have wanted to go. The ambitious will see it as an opportunity to advance their careers, he says. And given how tough it is to serve in North Korea, some will have relished the chance to experience life abroad for the first time. \"I think they'll be more willing to fight than Russian troops,\" he adds, admitting that in their situation, he too would have wanted to be sent. Chun In-bum, a former commander of South Korea's special forces, agrees with the defectors' appraisals. \"Just because they lack food and training, does not mean they are incapable. They will acclimatise quickly. We should not underestimate them.\" While 11,000 troops are unlikely to turn the tide of such an attritional war – it is estimated Russia is suffering more than a thousand casualties a day – experts and officials believe this could be just the first tranche, with Pyongyang potentially able to send up to 60,000 or even 100,000 if they are rotated. In these numbers, Mr Chun believes they could end up being effective. Also, Kim Jong Un will be able to shoulder big losses without affecting the stability of his regime, the former soldiers say. \"Those who have been sent will be men without influence or connections – to put it bluntly, those who can be sacrificed without issue,\" Haneul says. He remembers being shocked to learn there were no children of high-ranking parents in his front-line unit: \"That's when I realised we were expendable.\" He does not expect much resistance from the families of the deceased, whose sons, he says, will be honoured as heroes. \"There are countless parents who have lost a child after sending them to the military,\" he adds, recalling his second cousin who died. His aunt received a certificate, praising her son for his heroic contribution.\n\nPhotos released by North Korea's state media in March 2024 show special forces soldiers taking part in a training session\n\nThe loyalty of the soldiers and their families could blunt Ukrainian and South Korean hopes that many will simply defect once they enter the fight. Kyiv and Seoul have discussed conducting psychological operations along the front line to encourage the men to surrender. But it seems they do not have access to mobile phones. According to Ukrainian intelligence, even Russian soldiers' phones are seized before they encounter North Korean troops. So, possible infiltration strategies include broadcasting messages through loudspeakers or using drones to drop leaflets. Both Ryu and Haneul decided to defect after reading anti-regime propaganda sent across the border from South Korea. But they are doubtful this would work so far from home. They say it takes a long time to build up the desire and courage to defect. Furthermore, Haneul suspects the officers will have been ordered to shoot anyone who attempts to flee. He remembers his comrades opening fire as he made his daring sprint across the DMZ. \"Twelve bullets flew just a metre over my head,\" he says. Even capturing the North Korean troops may prove challenging for Ukraine. In the North, being a prisoner of war is considered extremely shameful and worse than death. Instead, soldiers are taught to take their own lives, by shooting themselves or detonating a grenade. Ryu recalls a famous military song entitled Save the Last Bullet. \"They tell you to save two bullets, one to shoot the enemy and one to shoot yourself.\" Nevertheless, the former special forces trainer Lee is determined to help. He has offered to go to the front line to communicate directly with the soldiers. \"It's unlikely they will defect in large numbers, but we have to try. Hearing familiar voices like mine, and others from North Korea, might impact their psychology,\" he says. Haneul just hopes they get home to North Korea. He knows there is a chance some of his relatives are among the troops sent to help Russia. \"I just hope they make it through and return safely.\""}

Mr Lee, who took a leave of absence from his job on Wednesday afternoon, is married to a Conservative candidate who is being looked into by the betting industry regulator. Laura Saunders, the party’s candidate in Bristol North West, has worked for the Tories since 2015 and is Mr Lee's partner. It is not known when either individual placed a bet or for how much money. Ms Saunders and Mr Lee have been approached for comment by the BBC and have not responded. Rishi Sunak announced 4 July as the date of the general election on 22 May, taking much of Westminster by surprise. A Conservative Party spokesman told the BBC: “We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals.\" The party said it would not be proper to comment further until any process was finished. If someone uses confidential information to gain an unfair advantage when betting, this could be a criminal offence under section 42 of the Gambling Act.\n\nA spokesperson for the Gambling Commission said: “The Gambling Commission regulates gambling in the interests of consumers and the wider public. \"Currently the Commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election. This is an ongoing investigation, and the Commission cannot provide any further details at this time. \"We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation.\" Last week it was alleged that one of Rishi Sunak’s closest aides, Craig Williams, placed a £100 bet on a July polling day three days before the PM named the date. Mr Williams, who was the Tory MP for Montgomery until the election was called and is standing again in the new constituency of Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, previously apologised and said he made a \"huge error of judgement\". When asked by the BBC, he refused to say whether he placed a bet on the basis of inside information.\n\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats have both called for Ms Saunders and Mr Williams to be suspended as Conservative candidates. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: “It’s very telling that Rishi Sunak has not already done that. “If it was one of my candidates, they’d be gone and their feet would not have touched the floor.” Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"It would be an utter disgrace if Conservative politicians were shown to be more focussed on turning a quick buck rather than the needs of the country.”\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nHousing Secretary Michael Gove said it would be “deeply wrong” if anyone had used “inside information” to place bets. \"What I can't do is sort of get too much into the detail of the case while an investigation is going on,” he told the BBC. \"But I can talk about the broad principle and you're absolutely right, it's reprehensible.\" The Conservative candidate in Guildford, Angela Richardson, told the BBC she was \"deeply disappointed\" and described the alleged bets as \"incredibly disrespectful\" to the prime minister and party activists. \"It would never occur to me to do that. \"I am angry... clever people sometimes do very silly things.\" On Wednesday, it emerged that a police officer working as part of the prime minister’s close protection team had been arrested following an allegation of bets on the timing of the election.

{"context": "‘Italian’ purees in UK supermarkets likely to contain Chinese forced-labour tomatoes\n\n“Italian” tomato purees sold by several UK supermarkets appear to contain tomatoes grown and picked in China using forced labour, the BBC has found. Some have “Italian” in their name such as Tesco’s “Italian Tomato Purée”. Others have “Italian” in their description, such as Asda’s double concentrate which says it contains “Puréed Italian grown tomatoes” - and Waitrose’s “Essential Tomato Purée”, describing itself as “Italian tomato puree”. A total of 17 products, most of them own-brands sold in UK and German retailers, are likely to contain Chinese tomatoes - testing commissioned by the BBC World Service shows. Most Chinese tomatoes come from the Xinjiang region, where their production is linked to forced labour by Uyghur and other largely Muslim minorities. The UN accuses the Chinese state - which views these minorities as a security risk - of torture and abuse. China denies it forces people to work in the tomato industry and says workers’ rights are protected by law. It says the UN report is based on “disinformation and lies”. All the supermarkets whose products we tested dispute our findings.\n\nChina grows most of its tomatoes in the Xinjiang region\n\nChina grows about a third of the world’s tomatoes. The north-western region of Xinjiang has the perfect climate for growing the fruit. It is also where China began a programme of mass detentions in 2017. Human rights groups allege more than a million Uyghurs have been detained in hundreds of facilities, which China has termed “re-education camps”. The BBC has spoken to 14 people who say they endured or witnessed forced labour in Xinjiang’s tomato fields over the past 16 years. “[The prison authorities] told us the tomatoes would be exported overseas,” Ahmed (not his real name) said, adding that if the workers did not meet the quotas - as much as 650kg a day - they would be shocked with electric prods. Mamutjan, a Uyghur teacher who was imprisoned in 2015 for an irregularity in his travel documentation, says he was beaten for failing to meet the high tomato quotas expected of him. “In a dark prison cell, there were chains hanging from the ceiling. They hung me up there and said ‘Why can’t you finish the job?’ They beat my buttocks really hard, hit me in the ribs. I still have marks.”\n\nMamutjan, who picked tomatoes in detention, says he was hung from the ceiling of his cell as punishment for not picking enough of the fruit\n\nIt is hard to verify these accounts, but they are consistent, and echo evidence in a 2022 UN report, external which reported torture and forced labour in detention centres in Xinjiang. By piecing together shipping data from around the world, with the non-profit organisation C4ADS, the BBC discovered how most Xinjiang tomatoes are transported into Europe - by train through Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and into Georgia, from where they are shipped onwards to Italy.\n\nOne company name repeatedly appeared as a recipient in the data. This was Antonio Petti, part of a group of major tomato-processing firms in Italy. It received more than 36 million kg of tomato paste from the company Xinjiang Guannong and its subsidiaries between 2020 and 2023, the data showed. The Petti group produces tomato goods under its own name, but also supplies others to supermarkets across Europe who sell them as their own branded products. Our investigation tested 64 different tomato purees sold in the UK, Germany and the US - comparing them in a lab to samples from China and Italy. They included top Italian brands and supermarket own-brands, and many were produced by Petti. We asked Source Certain, a world-renowned origin verification firm based in Australia, to investigate whether the origin claims on the purees’ labels were accurate. The company began by building what its CEO Cameron Scadding calls a “fingerprint” which is unique to a country of origin - analysing the trace elements which the tomatoes absorb from local water and rocks. “The first objective for us was to establish what the underlying trace element profile would look like for China, and [what] a likely profile would look like for Italy. We found they were very distinct,” he said. Source Certain then compared those country profiles with the 64 tomato purees we wanted to test - the majority of which claimed to contain Italian tomatoes or gave the impression they did - and a few which did not make any origin claim. The lab results suggested many of these products did indeed contain Italian tomatoes - including all those sold in the US, top Italian brands including Mutti and Napolina, and some German and UK supermarket own-brands, including those sold by Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer. But 17 appeared to contain Chinese tomatoes, 10 of which are made by Petti - the Italian company we found listed repeatedly in international shipping records. Of those 10 made by Petti, these were for sale in UK supermarkets at the time of testing from April-August 2024:\n\nThese were for sale in German supermarkets, during our testing period:\n\nIn response, all the supermarkets said they took these allegations very seriously and have carried out internal investigations which found no evidence of Chinese tomatoes. Many have also disputed the testing methodology used by our experts. Tesco suspended supply and Rewe immediately withdrew the products. Waitrose, Morrisons, Edeka and Rewe said they had run their own tests, and that the results contradicted ours and did not show the presence of Chinese tomatoes in the products. But one major retailer has admitted to using Chinese tomatoes. Lidl told us they were in another version of its Baresa Tomatenmark - made by the Italian supplier Giaguaro - sold in Germany last year “for a short time” because of supply problems and that they are investigating this. Giaguaro said all its suppliers respected workers' rights and it is currently not using Chinese tomatoes in Lidl products. The BBC understands the tomatoes were supplied by the Xinjiang company Cofco Tunhe, which the US sanctioned in December last year for forced labour. In 2021, one of the Petti group’s factories was raided by the Italian military police on suspicion of fraud - it was reported by the Italian press that Chinese and other foreign tomatoes were passed off as Italian. But a year after the raid, the case was settled out of court. Petti denied the allegations about Chinese tomatoes and the issue was dropped. As part of our investigation into Petti, a BBC undercover reporter posed as a businessman wanting to place a large order with the firm. Invited to tour a company factory in Tuscany by Pasquale Petti, the General Manager of Italian Food, part of the Petti group, our reporter asked him if Petti used Chinese tomatoes. “Yes… In Europe no-one wants Chinese tomatoes. But if for you it’s OK, we will find a way to produce the best price possible, even using Chinese tomatoes,” he said.\n\nPetti sent us what it said was its last invoice from Xinjiang Guannong (l) dated October 2020, but our undercover reporter spotted a label on a barrel sent to Petti dated August 2023\n\nThe reporter’s undercover camera also captured a crucial detail - a dozen blue barrels of tomato paste lined up inside the factory. A label visible on one of them read: “Xinjiang Guannong Tomato Products Co Ltd, prod date 2023-08-20.” In its response to our investigation, the Petti group told us it had not bought from Xinjiang Guannong since that company was sanctioned by the US for using forced labour in 2020, but did say that it had regularly purchased tomato paste from a Chinese company called Bazhou Red Fruit. This firm “did not engage in forced labour”, Petti told us. However our investigation has found that Bazhou Red Fruit shares a phone number with Xinjiang Guannong, and other evidence, including shipping data analysis, suggests that Bazhou is its shell company. Petti added that: “In future we will not import tomato products from China and will enhance our monitoring of suppliers to ensure compliance with human and workers’ rights.” While the US has introduced strict legislation to ban all Xinjiang exports, Europe and the UK take a softer approach, allowing companies simply to self-regulate to ensure forced labour is not used in supply chains. This is now set to change in the EU, which has committed to stronger laws, says Chloe Cranston, from the NGO Anti-Slavery In", "continuation": "ternational.

A spokesperson for the UK Department for Business and Trade told us: “We are clear that no company in the UK should have forced labour in its supply chain… We keep our approach to how the UK can best tackle forced labour and environmental harms in supply chains under continual review and work internationally to enhance global labour standards.” The issue was brought up in the UK Parliament on Monday, where the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it was “extremely concerning”. Baroness Hayman of Ullock told the House of Lords that the department was “looking at labelling as a way to better inform consumers”. Dario Dongo, journalist and food lawyer, says the findings expose a wider problem - “the true cost of food\". “So when we see [a] low price we have to question ourselves. What is behind that? What is the true cost of this product? Who is paying for that?”"}

The Ministry of Defence said the move followed extensive engagement with LGBT veterans and campaigners. Veterans can apply to have their rank restored and discharge reason amended. The total amount available to affected personnel will be increased from a proposed £50m to £75m. Defence Secretary John Healey called the wrongs faced by LGBT service members a \"moral stain on our nation\" in an apology to the House of Commons.\n\nApplications will open on Friday for LGBT veterans who were dismissed or discharged because of their sexual orientation or gender identity to receive £50,000. Additional payments of up to £20,000 will also be available for those negatively impacted by the ban on LGBT personnel between 1967 and 2000. This is aimed at those who suffered harassment, invasive investigations and those who were sent to prison. The exact amount of additional compensation will be decided by an independent panel. All payments will be exempt from income tax and will not affect means-tested benefits. Healey said veterans who suffered mistreatment in the armed forces under the \"gay ban\" can expect to be paid compensation \"soon into the ", "continuation": "new year\". He told the commons: \"On behalf of the Government, I want to apologise without reservation for the pain and the injustice caused during this dark chapter of our armed forces history\". Under the plans, LGBT veterans would have \"any blame or dishonour\" stricken from their service records, Healey said. Homosexuality started being decriminalised in the UK in 1967 but a ban continued in the armed forces until 2000. Those who were or were perceived to be gay were often subjected to lengthy investigations before being discharged from the military.\n\nStephen Close, who joined the army when he was 18, said he will be hoping for some financial compensation. Mr Close was convicted of the sexual offence of gross indecency after kissing another man while stationed in Berlin in the 1980s. He lived as a convicted sex offender for 30 years before being pardoned in 2013. \"Because of my criminal record, I've had to go from job to job. I've built no pension whatsoever. I've no savings. I've never been on holiday. I don't think I've ever had anything new. It's just been a constant struggle all my life\", Mr Close told the BBC.\n\nStephen Close was sent to military prison after officers found out he had kissed another man\n\n\"Mentally, it's been absolutely terrible. I've suffered for many years with depression, anxiety, I have panic attacks\", Mr Close added. Despite that, he said he is still \"proud\" to have served his country. A National Audit Office report found that up to 4,000 veterans are expected to be eligible for compensation. The LGBT Veterans Independent Review, led by Britain's first openly gay judge, Lord Etherton, revealed decades of bullying, assaults and expulsions of LGBT servicemen and women - often leaving them without income or pensions. On the report's release, the then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak apologised in Parliament, calling the ban \"an appalling failure\" of the British state. The government says the £75m available is significantly above the level recommended in the Etherton Review. Veterans will be able to join the scheme from Friday 13 December."}

Businesses recorded bumper sales over the weekend amid the frenzy of fan excitement for The Eras Tour at Murrayfield Stadium. The US singer's three night stint in Scotland had an \"unbelievable impact\" on the city's hospitality industry. There was also the Edinburgh Taylored Taste Trail which saw shops, cafes and restaurants showcasing cocktails, mocktails, afternoon teas, ice creams, desserts, and cupcakes inspired by the singer's iconic songs. There were Blank Space chocolates, Shake It Off confetti creations and Enchanted teas. And some businesses even made their own friendship bracelets for customers. Friendship bracelets are a major part of the Taylor Swift experience - they are handmade, typically out of plastic wire and colourful beads - many fans add letter beads to spell out some of Swift's albums or lyrics. Swifties go up to each other and trade bracelets they have made.\n\nLauren Stenhouse, owner of Coro The Chocolate Cafe, told BBC Scotland News, she had sold more than 100 bespoke Taylor-inspired chocolate fondue boards with dipping sauces and American pancakes and brownies. \"It's been unreal. That's been our best weekend since we have opened. \"The cafe was full and we were having to turn people away because it was so busy and we have never had to do that before. \"It was so much motivation for us as a small business. Sometimes you can have bad days when you see other businesses closing around you and you think 'maybe we are next' but this makes all the bad memories just dissipate. \"We are so excited. I couldn't be more pleased and I cannot believe the impact that tour has had on the hospitality industry in general. \"I could never have anticipated the turnout we got so we are just incredibly ecstatic about it and happy.\" She added that there were so many Swifties handing our friendship bracelets to each other in the shop. \"They created such a nice community setting, it was really sweet,\" she said.\n\nHavana Tansey and Ross Groves made lots of Taylor Swift friendship bracelets for their customers at The Alchemist\n\nClaire Meikle, general manager of The Alchemist, told BBC Scotland that lots of sequins were left behind. \"We had hundreds of Taylor Swift fans - they were very recognisable. \"Everyone was coming in and looking fantastic, it was just such a lovely vibe in the bar because everyone was happy and excited for the concert. \"We had so many people in from the states who were saying apparently it was $5,000 ($£4,000) for one ticket because they don't have control of ticket touts in the US so when they release the tickets they are all swept up immediately and resol", "continuation": "d for a very high price. \"So we had a lot of people in from America and Canada who said they were having a whole holiday for the price they would have paid for in the US. \"When you went into the toilets there was a lot of sequins and a lot of glitter everywhere, it was funny. The cleaners have been working very hard.\" The specialist cocktail and mocktail bar in St James Quarter gave out handmade friendship bracelets with certain drinks. \"They are quite time consuming to make so we couldn't keep up with demand so then we started putting everything to make one bracelet into a bag so they could make them themselves. \"We were running back and forth between other businesses nearby to trade beads with different letters that we needed.\n\nGrandmother Lee Johnston and her family from Virginia in the US travelled to Edinburgh to see the Eras concert again and enjoyed taking selfies with the Taylor Swift lifesize cut out at the Camera Obscura & World of Illusions\n\nClaire Riddoch, marketing manager at at the Camera Obscura & World of Illusions in Edinburgh, said their Giant Kaleidosphere of Taylor Swift and cardboard cut out had been a huge hit with fans. A bespoke animation of the singer was created for the tourist attraction on the Royal Mile. It showed the star wearing a Scottish Jimmy hat while playing bagpipes as she travels through the capital on her way to perform at Murrayfield. Her image was split into dozens of pieces to create an illusion that runs 9ft deep. \"We had a lot of Swifties in over the weekend, we could tell they were here for the concert and were in their hats,\" she said. \"We had a lifesize cardboard cut out of Taylor in our foyer which was very popular, so many photographs and selfies got lots of social media interaction. \"Our Taylor Swift cut out was so popular we are going to keep it and move her to our Autowed machine so you can get married to her. \"There are only two of these machines in the whole world and it's a machine that allows you to get married. \"The machine gives you a certificate and a couple of rings and it will marry you to whomever you would like, it's not legally binding but it is very popular so we are going to put Taylor down beside the machine so people can continue their love affair with Taylor if they wish.\"\n\nIain McKechnie at Sweet Paradice set up a 19 piece menu inspired by the American singer\n\nIain McKechnie, supervisor of Sweet Paradice Desserts which is painted pink inside and out, said they set up a 19-piece menu inspired by the American singer as she is \"all about pink too\". He told BBC Scotland: \"We were the second biggest pink icon in Edinburgh over the weekend. \"We named cookie dough and waffle and ice cream desserts and drinks all after her songs and albums - all great fun.\"\n\nAmy and Ailsa Cameron had a T-shirt made for their dad, Neil, with lyrics from a Taylor Swift song\n\nAilsa Cameron, 32, who went to all three shows over the weekend with her sister Amy, 29, said they spent more than £750 between them and got a special pre-sale code for tickets in July 2023 after pre-ordering the Midnights album in October 2022. \"We have been fans for 16 years and we wanted to go to all of them in our home town. One of the main reasons is the surprise songs Taylor does, they are different every night so we wanted to see all the surprise songs she did in Edinburgh. \"They were amazing. On Friday I got one of my dream surprise songs ever which is Daylight, so I was over the moon with that. \"Then on the Saturday night we went with our dad and his favourite Taylor Swift song is Get Away Car and that was one of her surprise songs so that was amazing she played that the night our dad came with us.\"\n\nTaylor Swift's lucky number 13 comes from her birth date - 13 December\n\nAilsa continued: \"We were near the front one of the nights and the others we were sitting in different parts of the stadium, which was one thing I personally enjoyed was having three different experiences of the concert. \"In the seats we were higher up so we got a whole view of the stage and the set up which we didn't quite get to see when we were standing at the front.\" They dressed up in different outfits for each night and had a T-shirt made for their dad using a line from one of Taylor's songs. \"We also got temporary tattoos of Taylor's lucky number 13 on our hands.\" \"We have grown up with her music, we have always been fans so it was just amazing to have her here, I just couldn't believe she came to our home town because on her other tours she hadn't been to Scotland for nine years.\""}

The new pandas will replace the zoo's existing pandas, named Wang Wang and Fu Ni, who are \"friendly messengers of China-Australia relations,\" Mr Li Said. Mr Li's arrival in Australia on a four-day trip is the first by a Chinese leader in seven years, marking improving ties between the two countries. Both China and Australia will see the visit as central to addressing outstanding trade and consular issues.\n\nMr Li said while Wang Wang and Fu Ni would return to their hometown by the end of the year, he promised that \"China will soon provide another pair of pandas that are equally beautiful, lively, cute and younger to the Adelaide Park [Zoo]. A practice that dates back as far as the Tang Dynasty, which ruled from 618 through 907 CE, panda diplomacy – or sending pandas as diplomatic gifts – has long been an instrument of China's diplomatic efforts. China is seeking to increase its influence in the South Pacific, expanding security and economic ties with island states that are historically allied with Australia. This has been a point of tension between the nations for years, but bilateral relations hit a low point when the former Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, called for an international inquiry in 2020 into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in China. Beijing's answer was to impose high tariffs, including on Australian wine. Mr Li's Australian hosts also took him to a winery during his visit - an apparent reminder that Beijing has only recently lifted the tariffs on wine. On his arrival in Adelaide on Saturday, Mr Li heralded a thaw in the diplomatic rift. He said: \"Mutual resp", "continuation": "ect, seeking common ground while shelving differences and mutually beneficial cooperation\" are key to the relationship.

On Monday, Mr Li will be in Canberra for a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Mr Albanese is expected to bring up the case of Mr Yang, who was given a suspended death sentence on espionage charges in February. As Mr Li engages in trade and panda diplomacy in Australia, Mr Yang's supporters released a statement on Sunday, saying Beijing's High Court had reviewed and upheld the lower court's sentence. \"Our most immediate concern is that Yang's medical conditions remain serious and unaddressed [...] we urge Prime Minister Albanese to use his meeting with Premier Li Qiang to directly demand that Yang be released on medical parole\".\n• None China and Australia: Frenemies who need each other"}

Some people look better in person. He looked great. He looked really nice, and I told him that,\" the US president-elect told the New York Post. The incoming US president also said the pair had touched on health problems in the Royal Family, adding that they had a \"great, great talk\". Prince William met Trump after the re-opening of the Notre-Dame cathedral.\n\n\"And I asked him about his wife and he said she's doing well,\" the president-elect said. \"I asked him about his father and his father is fighting very hard, and he loves his father and he loves his wife, so it was sad.\" The reference to the King \"fighting hard\" was described by royal sources as being about his efforts to continue living actively, rather than a health update. The King has been receiving cancer treatment, but has wanted to keep focusing on his work, with overseas trips expected for next year. \"We had a great talk for half an hour, a little more than half an hour.

{"context": "Khaled al Hamad dug up human remains in search of his two brothers, who vanished under the Assad regime\n\nAdra is a strange kind of neighbourhood cemetery – two lone graves sit in an empty expanse of bumpy earth, sparsely covered with grass. For years, this was an area tightly controlled by President Bashar al-Assad's forces. Now, a week after they fled, a concrete slab in one corner of this empty cemetery has been moved to reveal a shallow grave containing at least half a dozen white bags, labelled with names and prison numbers. Khaled al Hamad, a nearby resident, was desperately pulling the bags out when we arrived. He shows us the three he has already opened. Each contains a human skull and bones. The writing on the sacks suggest they are the remains of two female prisoners, and one male. It is not clear how they died, or whether this is evidence of criminal abuse by Assad's regime. But Khaled needs no convincing. He's searching for his two brothers, Jihad and Hussein, taken by Assad's notorious air force intelligence a decade ago. They haven't been heard of since.\n\n\"Some people were taken to an area called 'the driving school' and liquidated there,\" he said. \"I expect this happened to my brothers. Maybe they are in some of these bags buried here.\" We shared this information with Human Rights Watch in Syria, who said they were investigating reports of prisoners' remains dumped in similar bags elsewhere. Assad's fall has unleashed a tsunami of hope from families who were left for decades without any way of finding out what happened to their loved ones. \"If you ever came past here [in Assad's time], you couldn't stop, you couldn't look up,\" Khaled said. \"Cars used to sp", "continuation": "eed past. If you stopped, they would come to you, put a plastic bag on your head and take you away.\" Tens of thousands of families like his are now searching for relatives who disappeared into Assad's notorious prison system, or into its military interrogation centres. Some were taken to the Mazzeh military airbase in Damascus.\n\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham member Abu Jarrah showed the BBC where he says prisoners were tortured by Assad's military\n\nThis site, once a key buffer between Assad and rebel forces, is deserted. Discarded military boots are strewn on the runway, a live rocket lies on the ground, the only signs of life are the new guards at the gate: young militia men from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the group that took control of Syria last week. They show us the torture room used by Assad's forces – including a metal pole to secure prisoners' feet for beating, and a set of wires next to an electrical switchboard. \"Here they electrocuted prisoners,\" the guards' commander, Abu Jarrah, tells me. \"These are electric cables – the investigator sits here, the guards put them on the prisoner's body and turn on the power. \"The prisoner loses his mind and confesses everything. They tell the interrogator to write whatever he wants, in the hope it will stop.\" Abu Jarrah also said that the 400 women held here were routinely raped, and that children were born into the prison. The only thing more painful than finding your parent or child among the records here is not finding them at all. In the building next door, families scratch desperately through thumbnail photos scattered in piles on the concrete floor – face after face staring grim and blank, silent witnesses to the years of Assad's rule.\n\nPhotos found at the Mazzeh military airbase showed some of those that were held there\n\nSobbing among them was the mother of Mahmoud Saed Hussein, a Kurd from al-Qamishli. \"Yesterday, we saw he was registered at the airbase prison,\" she told me. \"We came but couldn't find him. I've been looking for him for 11 years, searching from one prison to another.\" \"These are all like my son,\" she wept, gesturing at the piles of photos on the floor. \"May God burn Assad's heart, as he has burned ours.\" Beyond them, three rooms packed to the rafters with files open out on each other, one after the other. Several people are crouching on a mountain of documents several feet high covering the floor. Assad's regime was meticulous in documenting its brutality – a vast bureaucracy of terror that makes the scale of its actions all too clear, but in which the stories of individuals are often lost or submerged.\n\nThe mother of Mahmoud Saed Hussein has been searching for her son for 11 years\n\n\"What are these notes?\" one woman raged. \"Nobody is helping us. We want someone to come and check these documents with us. How can I find him among this many prison files?\" The lack of any ordered system means critical evidence is being lost each day at sites across Syria – information about the missing, but also potentially, any links between Assad's regime and foreign governments like the US or the UK, both of which have been accused of benefitting from the American policy of extraordinary rendition, in which terrorist suspects were sent for interrogation to countries that used torture. Human rights groups have accused the UK government of turning a blind eye to the US practice during the so-called war on terror, when America sent detainees to several countries in the Middle East, including Syria. Outside, the silent hangars of the airbase are dotted with the charred remains of Russian-made planes and radar, hit by repeated Israeli airstrikes over the past week. Assad's departure has shifted the delicate balance of power between conflicting groups in Syria, and their various international backers, including Turkey, Iran and the US. This was never just Syria's war and outside powers still have a stake in what happens here. Syrians are adamant that the time has come for them to govern themselves without anyone dictating what they should do. As we leave, a young HTS fighter climbs up on a roof to slash at the portrait of Assad hanging above the interrogation building. He grins down to the comrades watching from below, as photos and documents from the regime's military files flutter around their boots. Assad's fall has posed as-yet-unanswered questions about Syria's future, but it has also left unanswered many questions from the past."}
{"context": "Best albums of 2024: Charli XCX, Beyonce, The Cure and more\n\nCharli XCX scored her second UK number 1 album with Brat, which was released in June to rave reviews\n\nWhen Charli XCX recorded her sixth album, Brat, she thought her prickly, abrasive dance anthems were \"not going to appeal to a lot of people\". In the end, the record topped the charts and became a cultural phenomenon. It was nominated for seven Grammys, referenced in the US presidential election, turned into a paint swatch, and named \"word of the year\" by Collins Dictionary. Now the album has been named the best new release of 2024 in a \"poll of polls\" compiled by BBC News. In multiple end of year lists, critics called Brat \"brilliant from start to finish, external\" and \"pop music for the future, external\", praising the way its \"painfully relatable, external\" lyrics captured Charli's insecurities, anxieties and obsessions. In the star's own words, the record is \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\". \"The louder you play it, the more honest it gets,\" said the Los Angeles Times, external. The BBC's poll is a \"super-ranking\" compiled from 30 year-end lists published by the world's most influential music magazines - including the NME, Rolling Stone, Spain's Mondo Sonoro and France's Les Inrockuptibles. Records were assigned points based on their position in each list - with the number one album getting 20 points, the number two album receiving 19 points, and so on. Brat was the runaway winner with a score of 486 points, nearly twice as many as the number two album, Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter. In total, the critics named 184 records among their favourites, from the The Cure's long-awaited comeback, Songs Of A Lost World, to the kaleidoscopic rap of Doechii's Alligator Bites Never Heal.\n\nCharli was born Emma Aitchison in Essex, UK, and has been chipping away at the coalface of pop for more than a decade. At the start of her career, she scored hits with shiny pop anthems such as Fancy, I Love It and Boom Clap - but over the years, her music has become more volatile and aggressive. Underground anthems like Vroom, Vroom and Track 10 turned her into a cult star but, as she confessed on Brat: \"I've started thinking again about whether I deserve commercial success\". With that in mind, she entered 2024 with a new sense of purpose. \"Before we'd even done much writing, she had a masterplan of all the stuff she wanted to write about, and all the things she wanted to say,\" producer AG Cook tells the BBC. \"She had a real vision for the album, right from the start.\" \"Even the name Brat was in play for about two years,\" adds co-producer Finn Keane.\n\nReleased in June, Brat became the soundtrack to the summer; and Charli extended her success with a remix album that rewrote many of the songs and added an array of guest stars, from Billie Eilish and Robyn to The 1975 and Lorde. The remix project was \"really, off-the-cuff and last minute\", says Cook, \"but that's been part of the fun of Brat\". \"Charli is just incredibly quick and open to ideas,\" adds Keane. \"You can give her kind of any kind of crazy track, and she'll instantly be able to come up with something super hooky, with a twist that's very memorable and elaborate. Billboard: \"Charli XCX pulled off one of the most exciting and culturally significant album launches in modern memory... And best of all? It was all on Charli's own terms. Drawing inspiration primarily from club culture and hyperpop, Charli pulled once-niche spaces in music into the mainstream.\" The Forty Five: \"In making a club record to ignite the underground, she's reached the world's biggest stages. Musically, Charli is at her peak.\"\n\nFrequently mis-labelled as a country album, Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter is so much more. A racial reckoning with the black roots of American folk music, its 27 tracks embrace everything from line-dancing to psychedelic rock, with guest appearances from Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson and Post Malone. The Times: \"The pop hoedown single Texas Hold 'Em remains the best piece, but the acoustic guitar-driven sexy ode Bodyguard is another highlight. Will this finally win Beyoncé her best album Grammy?\" NME: \"A masterclass in creativity from an artist who never forgets her roots.\"\n\nThe fourth album by Dublin's Fontaines DC saw the quintet take their scratchy, sinister sound and run it through a technicolor filter. The results include everything from stadium-sized sing-alongs (Favourite) to panic-inducing punk anthems (Starburster). Allmusic: \"When all is said and done, they remain fantastic songwriters, able to convey a variety of emotions without relying on the trappings of punk. The corners may have been sanded off, but it has only revealed new and interesting textures underneath.\" Mojo magazine: \"Fontaines D.C. are now, in terms of risk-taking potential, the Arctic Monkeys' closest rivals.\"\n\nThe title says it all. None of the songs on Billie Eilish's exquisite third album are content to sit still, moving from hushed intimacy to emotional volatility as the singer navigates the murky waters of her early 20s. The Telegraph: \"Eilish has made something rich, strange, smart, sad and wise enough to stand comparison with Joni Mitchell's Blue. A heartbreak masterpiece for her generation, and for the ages.\" The Guardian: \"An album that keeps wrongfooting the listener, Hit Me Hard and Soft is clearly intended as something to gradually unpick: A bold move in a pop world where audiences are usually depicted as suffering from an attention deficit that requires instant gratification.\"\n\nBilled by one publication as the \"poet laureate of indie rock, external\", MJ Lenderman's breakthrough album is tender, melancholy and wryly funny, populated by a cast of flawed, disappointed and disappointing characters he observed around his hometown of Asheville, North Carolina. New York Times: \"An ace guitarist with a keen ear for jangly tones, he lends even his most pathetic characters a bit of warm-blooded humanity.\" The Line Of Best Fit: \"How he gets you to care about nobodies from nowhere and their very strange plights is in part to do with his knack for universal empathy, but more importantly, the fact that he sings everything like he was just robbed at gunpoint by his 8th grade bully who he later watched win the lottery. You feel bad for things you don't necessarily even understand.\"\n\nSixteen years in the making, The Cure's 14th studio album didn't disappoint. Written during a period where frontman Robert Smith lost his mother, father and brother, it is simultaneously dark and fragile. Speaking to the BBC, Smith said making the record had been \"hugely cathartic\" in escaping the \"doom and gloom\" he felt. Time magazine: \"It's no exaggeration that this is an album haunted by death, so it's almost ironic that, musically speaking, there hasn't been this much life in The Cure for decades.\" Pitchfork: \"It feels like a record whose time is right, delivering a concentrated dose of The Cure and cutting the fat that dogged their later albums.\"\n\nA sprawling, two-hour opus of dreamy pop and psychedelia, this is one of the year's most mysterious records. You can't buy the CD or vinyl, and it's not available on Spotify or Apple Music. At the time of writing, it's only available as a continuous, ad-free stream on YouTube, external, or as a download from Bandcamp., external But the seventh album by Cyndi Lee (the drag alter-ego of rock musician Patrick Flegel) is definitely worth your seeking out - like the lost transmissions of a ghostly 1960s pirate radio station. Uncut: \"Cindy Lee has managed to buck just about every trend, convention and expectation of what releasing music in the digital age is supposed to look and like. And, even more crucially, it sounds just as refreshing.\" Stereogum: \"Diamond Jubilee is two hours of unrushed wandering through a lo-fi escape, catchy to the point of sticky, tarnishing in its abrasiveness yet sun-baked to perfection.\"\n\nOn her sixth album as Waxahatchee, singer-songwriter Katie Crutchfield tackles everything from anxiety and self-doubt, to her ongoing struggle with sobriety, with piercing insight and a laid-back country-rock feel. Pitchfork: \"Her mind is alive and humming, and her language leaps out at you with its hunger.\" Consequence o", "continuation": "f Sound: \"Crutchfield is still growing, both personally and artistically, and we're just glad she's invited us along for the ride.\"\n\nAfter landing the decisive blow in his rap beef with Drake, Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar took a victory lap on his surprise sixth album, GNX. Razor sharp and rhythmically complex, it's both a poison pen letter to his detractors, and a love letter to Los Angeles' hip-hop culture. LA Times: \"Lamar is worked up about liars, about folks doling out backhanded compliments, about other rappers with \"old-ass flows\" wasting space with empty rhymes. Indeed, what seems to make him angriest is the idea that a person could triumph in hip-hop by taking hip-hop less seriously than he does.\" Complex: \"Even cooler is how much space Kendrick gives to underground rappers from the LA scene—figures who are talented but raw, and would likely struggle to gain national recognition without a boost.\"\n\nSix albums into her career, former Disney star Sabrina Carpenter landed on a winning formula - one that puts aside the cookie-cutter pop of her teen years, and zeroes in on her sly humour as a USP. Fleet of foot and packed with memorable one-liners, it produced three number one singles in the UK, including song of the year contender Espresso.

{"context": "The Liberal Democrats have called for an extension to Saturday's deadline to access winter fuel payments, warning tens of thousands of older people could miss out. There has been a surge in applications for pension credit since Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in July that the payment for this year would be mainly limited to those receiving the benefit. But as of mid-November, external, thousands more pensioners believed to be eligible had not yet applied. At this point there was also a backlog of 91,000 unprocessed claims, with around 9,000 being processed each week, according to the latest official figures, external. The government says it has been working to boost take-up and eligible claims can be backdated.\n\nPeople have until the end of Saturday to apply for pension credit to get this year's winter fuel payment. The deadline for online applications is 23:59 GMT, while the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said its claim phone lines would also be open from 08:00 to 15:15. The Lib Dems are calling for this deadline to be extended to 28 February and for applications to be processed quicker, to ensure vulnerable pensioners do not miss out. Previously all pensioners got the payment to help with energy costs, worth between £200 and £300. But in July the government said future payments in England and Wales would only go to those on low incomes who received specified benefits such as pension credit, meaning more than 10 million people will no longer be eligible. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has defended the move, saying tough decisions were necessary because of the state of the public finances. But it has been criticised by several cha", "continuation": "rities, unions and opposition parties, with some Labour MPs also raising concerns about the impact on low-income pensioners. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Older people across the country are having to make heart-breaking decisions over whether to heat their homes or eat over the Christmas period. \"Ministers need to do everything they can to limit the damage of their wrong-headed decision to slash Winter Fuel Payments for millions of pensioners.\"\n\nFollowing its announcement, the government launched a campaign encouraging those eligible to claim pension credit, with around 150,000 new applications between 29 July and 17 November. But this represents a small fraction of the 880,000 pensioners estimated to be eligible who had not put in a claim. Age UK says it has been inundated with requests for help to apply for the benefit. The charity's director Caroline Abrahams told the BBC: \"For some older people, they still haven't heard about pension credit or the form is too overwhelming. \"There is help available but of course the system is overwhelmed at the moment.\" Analysis by BBC Verify suggests tens of thousands of pensioners are unlikely to receive their Winter Fuel Payment before the end of the year because of the backlog in unprocessed claims. The DWP says it has deployed 500 additional staff to speed up processing. A government spokesperson said: \"Over one million pensioners will still receive the winter fuel payment, and our drive to boost pension credit take-up has seen applications more than double with over 40,000 more pensioners now receiving it, as well as the winter fuel payment. \"We continue to urge anyone who thinks they may be entitled to pension credit to check now, as all eligible claims can be backdated, and anyone who makes a successful claim before December 21 will receive their payment.\""}
{"context": "How German podcast tracked down fugitive militant after 30 years\n\nFormer Red Army Faction (RAF) member Daniela Klette was wanted for attempted murder and aggravated robbery\n\nDaniela Klette lived quietly. She walked her dog and gave maths tuition to her neighbours’ children. But when she was arrested in late February, the police found tens of thousands of euros in cash in her Berlin flat and five weapons, among them a Kalashnikov assault rifle and a replica rocket launcher. Klette, 65, had been on the run for more than 30 years. She was wanted for crimes connected to the left-wing militant Red Army Faction (RAF), which was active in Germany from the 1970s to the 1990s. Known in its early days as the Baader Meinhof group, the gang pursued their political aims through the kidnap or murder of senior members of the business and industrial communities. The RAF’s notoriety had led to a podcast team in Berlin trying to track Klette down using a facial recognition tool. The podcast ran shortly before Christmas, only weeks before the arrest. But police deny a connection. They say they had a tip-off from a member of the public.\n\nThe RAF’s crimes are not forgotten in Germany, even if a generation has passed since they were committed. They continue to exercise the imaginations of film and television producers, who have been making high-budget drama and documentary series that recall the assassinations of the 1980s and 90s. “The RAF is deeply rooted in the collective memory, at least in western Germany,” says Petra Terhoeven, an expert in the history of political violence at Göttingen University. Later this year, for example, German television will run a new four-part drama about Alfred Herrhausen, the head of Deutsche Bank, who was murdered shortly after the opening of the Berlin Wall in 1989. A sophisticated roadside bomb destroyed his armoured Mercedes as he was being driven to work. In 2020 the first Netflix original series for the German market, A Perfect Crime, examined the assassination of Detlev Rohwedder. He was the head of the Treuhandanstalt, the organisation established after German reunification to privatise all state-owned industry in the former East Germany. Rohwedder was killed by a shot from a sniper’s rifle through an upstairs window ", "continuation": "at his home in Düsseldorf in the spring of 1991. In neither case have the perpetrators been caught. The Netflix series was made by the Beetz Brothers production company. Recalling its origins, co-director Georg Tschurtschenthaler says the brief was to find a project that the whole country would talk about. “It had to be big and relevant,” he says. “It had to create some noise.”\n\nGeorg Tschurtschenthaler said the period of RAF attacks still resonate today in Germany\n\nA Perfect Crime, while acknowledging the letter found at the crime scene in which the RAF claimed responsibility for Rohwedder’s murder, presents a number of different scenarios as to who may have killed him. For Tschurtschenthaler the background to the murder is what matters – the rapid closure of much of East German industry and the loss of millions of jobs. “It’s a dark period that resonates until today,” he says. Petra Terhoeven, the historian, warns of the dangers of a trivialisation of the crimes committed by the RAF. She detects too great a focus on the perpetrators, too little consideration for the victims. The victim who has received perhaps most attention is Alfred Herrhausen, a charismatic and influential banker and a personal friend of then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl. A new documentary will accompany the four-part television drama later this year. Herrhausen has also been portrayed in fiction, by the writer Tanja Langer. “When I was writing my novel it was important for me to create an homage to this person,” she says of her book. The novel, an account of a relationship between a young woman and an older man, a banker, is written from personal experience. Langer and Herrhausen had a close friendship for several years until his death. Even though the RAF claimed responsibility for Herrhausen’s murder, Tanja Langer thinks the truth may not be as simple. She did several years’ research for her novel and spent a lot of time in the archive of the former East German secret police, the Stasi. “In the end my conclusion was that even if the RAF carried out the murder, maybe there were others that were also part of it,” she says.\n\nIt’s that uncertainty, in part, that fuels the continued interest. There are still many unsolved murders from the 1980s and it’s possible that Daniela Klette, now behind bars, knows something about them. Not long before she was arrested, a podcast company in Berlin, Undone, set out to find her. They had been contacted by a listener who said he’d been at a party where a woman had claimed to be Klette. “It was a crazy story,” says Patrick Stegemann, who worked on the series. Undone brought in an AI expert who deployed facial recognition software to search the internet for pictures that matched one of Klette on an old “Wanted” poster. It came up with a match for a woman living as “Claudia” not far from where the podcasters operate out of an old industrial premises in Berlin. But when they went to look for her, she was nowhere to be found. Two months later, when Daniela Klette, was arrested, it became clear that they had identified the right woman. Patrick Stegemann remembers hearing the news of the arrest. “It was a wild mixture of feelings,” he says. Prosecutors are currently going through dozens of boxes of evidence and are yet to bring charges against Klette. Petra Terhoeven is sceptical she will offer any help. “The majority of former members of the RAF don't speak about the past,” she says. “It’s like a political sect, it’s a kind of cartel of silence. And so probably she will remain silent.” Tim Mansel’s programme “Germany’s AI detectives” is available now on BBC Sounds"}

A gun was found near his body.

{"context": "The baseball world has saluted the achievements of Willie Mays, widely considered one of the sport's best ever players, after his death at age 93. Mays was twice declared the league's Most Valuable Player (MVP) and won the World Series with the New York Giants in 1954. His famous catch during the championship remains one of the most iconic plays ever seen in America’s so-called “national pastime”. In addition to his on-field achievements, Mays embodied an attitude of \"just keep playing and having fun\", one former player told the BBC. Nicknamed the “Say Hey Kid”, the centre fielder had been baseball’s oldest living Hall of Famer. His death was announced \"with great sadness\" on Tuesday by his former team, who are now the San Francisco Giants. Mays's son, Michael, told the Associated Press that his father died in the presence of his family and wished to thank his fans for their years of support. \"My father has passed away peacefully and among loved ones. I want to thank you all from the bottom of my broken heart for the unwavering love you have shown him over the years,” he said. “You have been his life's blood.\" Major League Baseball (MLB) said it was \"heartbroken\" over the death of \"one of the most exciting all-around players in the history of our sport\". Mays was a \"true Giant on and off the field\", MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said. \"His incredible achievements and statistics do not begin to describe the awe that came with watching Willie Mays dominate the game in every way imaginable,” Manfred added. President Joe Biden said in a statement on Wednesday that Mays was the reason he wanted to play centerfield as a child in Little League. \"It was a rite of passage to practice his basket catches, daring steals, and command at the plate – only to be told by coaches to cut it out because no one can do what Willie Mays could do,\" the president said. Mays was \"more than just a baseball icon\", California Governor Gavin Newsom said. \"He broke barriers and inspired millions of Americans - setting records, bringing joy to countless fans, and becoming a role model for a generation of future athletes.\" Barry Bonds, Mays's godson and another former Giants player - also considered to be among the best in the game - paid tribute to the baseball great, saying “you helped shape who I am today”. “I have no words to describe what you mean to me,” Bonds said in a post on social media. MLB sportswriter Sarah Langs said that Mays was her mother’s hero. “I am where I am today because of how he captivated her from a young age,” she said. “His joy for the game inspired her, and she passed that love onto me.”\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAnother former baseball player, CC Sabathia, wrote that Mays “changed the game forever and inspired kids like me to chase our dream.” Despite having not played professional sports for over 50 years, the MLB added 10 more hits to Mays's career record earlier this month, after deciding to incorporate statistics from the Negro League. His record now stands at 3,293 hits, including the 10 he hit for the Birmingham Black Barons in 1948. As recently as Monday, Mays said he would not be able to attend a game in his honour that was scheduled for Thursday in Birmingham. “My heart will be with all of you who are honouring the Negro League ballplayers, who should always be r", "continuation": "emembered, including all my teammates on the Black Barons,\" he said. “It’ll be a special day, and I hope the kids will enjoy it and be inspired by it.\" Mays was born and raised in Westfield, Alabama, and began his professional baseball career while still in high school in 1948. In 1950, he joined the New York Giants - who later became the San Francisco Giants - and in 1951 hit 20 home runs for the team as a 20-year-old. After the 1951 season Mays was drafted into the US Army to serve in the Korean War.\n\nAfter missing the 1952 and 1953 seasons due to his military service, Mays returned in 1954 to earn his first MVP award. That same year, he helped the team defeat Cleveland in the World Series. The famous over-the-shoulder catch he made during the game helped the team clinch the win with a score of 5-2 after 10 innings. In 1972 he was traded to the New York Mets at the age of 41, where he played for two more seasons before retiring. After his playing career, he was still a regular face in the Giants dugout, offering advice on and off the field to young players. “He always had time for you. He had a way about him that you could talk to him about baseball and he would give you honest opinions,” retired Giants player JT Snow told the BBC. “Baseball is a hard game, and we go through ups and downs. I remember him saying: ‘Just keep playing and having fun.’” Snow said Mays kept the noise of analytics and statistics out of his head, sticking with a simple philosophy that saw him change the game: “I see the ball and hit the ball, and I run the bases and I catch it.”"}

King’s College Hospital, Guy’s and St Thomas’ - including the Royal Brompton and the Evelina London Children’s Hospital - and primary care services are among those affected. The incident has had a \"major impact\" on the delivery of services, especially blood transfusions and test results.\n\nIt is thought to have happened on Monday, meaning some departments could not connect to a main server. Some procedures have been cancelled or have been redirected to other NHS providers as the hospitals try to establish what work can be carried out safely.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nJordan Pickford (Everton): He made some massive saves and stopped Arsenal in their tracks. Everton have been under the cosh a lot this year and it's good to see him step up. See, just as much as I hammer him, I can also be nice...\n\nDjed Spence (Tottenham): I don't understand why he hasn't been playing, that's a question for Ange Postecoglou. It looked like it wasn't going to work out for him last year, but he's come back in in the summer and worked hard and been patient. Again, he was excellent and solid and looked like he had been playing all season. Nikola Milenkovic (Nottingham Forest): He has been really good for Forest and it's back-to-back games now where he has been scoring from set-pieces. He's been colossal at the back. A lot of people love Murillo next to him, but he is that calm head. Archie Gray (Tottenham): The way he has acquitted and handled himself, I think he's done really well. He was put in at centre-back against Southampton and impressed. He also came through the game at Rangers in midweek with his head held high. Marc Cucurella (Chelsea): I can't deny he's been playing really well for Chelsea this year. He stupidly got sent off at the end of the game but even so he is performing above expectation. When Chelsea first signed him I wasn't so sure. But he's since been a really consistent performer, to the point where Chelsea will probably end up selling Ben Chilwell. That just shows how good the lad has been doing. And he had a great finish as well.\n\nPape Matar Sarr (Tottenham): He's been good for a couple of weeks and this was the kind of game where he gets a goal and he shows his level of class and composure. This time I'm going to stick him in - even if it was only against Southampton. Manuel Ugarte (Manchester United): He has really, really surprised me. I know it's still early days under the new manager, but Ugarte has a bit of bite about him. ", "continuation": "He's a bit horrible and even at 1-0 down he was making important tackles, blocks and getting attacks started. I thought he was the catalyst as to why they went on to win. I thought if it wasn't for him they wouldn't actually be in the game. An underrated performance that only his team-mates will appreciate.\n\nAmad Diallo (Manchester United): It's been really difficult to pick the forwards this week but Amad Diallo is the only one who is a no-brainer. He was excellent, flipped the Manchester derby on its head. As a young man he just seems to be growing better and better. All that noise around Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford, Diallo just seems to be going about his business and delivering on a regular basis, and that's what it's all about. Ismaila Sarr (Crystal Palace): When I played with him at Watford he was a winger, but at Palace they're playing him as a 10 and he's going to show people just how good of a footballer he is. He is also the quickest person I've ever played with and for his second goal he made up five yards on Lewis Dunk and then for his finish was about 15 yards ahead. Unbelievable finish and great to see him off the mark and flying at Palace. Jacob Murphy (Newcastle): If I'm being totally honest, I never thought I'd do a Team of the Week where we'd be talking about Jacob Murphy. That's probably the best compliment I can give him, he's playing that well I have to put him in. Two goals at the weekend, excellent performance. Alexander Isak (Newcastle): The best striker in the Premier League at this moment in time. Yes I've said it and yes I stand by it. He's the complete striker. Unreal. Every time I watch him I keep thinking, how haven't Arsenal signed him? He's a really good player and finisher. He's a poacher but he's also such a silky player. You don't see many silky poachers.\n\nRuben Amorim (Manchester United): I'm not giving this for Manchester United's win, the winning is separate. I'm giving it for the Rashford and Garnacho decision. It was a huge tone-setter for what he is doing at Manchester United. At one point, with Manchester United losing, I thought he might have to back off that decision because all the chat if they'd have lost would have been about what if those two had played. But he gets the win and no-one is talking about it which is how it should be. Standards are set and he is saying this is what you've got to do and I see and hear everything. You have to make sure you're a Manchester United player with a high level of standard and application otherwise you won't be there.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

On 9 December, Russian media announced that he had been given asylum there - even though there has not been any official confirmation. The Syrian rebel groups are continuing to form a transitional government. HTS, Syria's most powerful rebel group, was set up under a different name, Jabhat al-Nusra, in 2011 and pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda the following year. Al-Nusra broke ties with al-Qaeda in 2016 and later took the name HTS when it merged with other factions. However, the UN, US, UK and a number of other countries continue to designate it as a terrorist group. Its leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, who previously used the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has pledged tolerance for different religious groups and communities. But his group's jihadist past has left some doubting whether it will live up to such promises. UN envoy Geir Pedersen, who met al-Sharaa on Sunday, said Syria must have a \"credible and inclusive\" transition. Qatar has also sent a delegation to Syria to meet transitional government officials ahead of the re-opening of its embassy on Tuesday, 13 years after it was closed. Western countries have not gone as far as re-opening their embassies, but in the past two days the US and the UK said they had been in touch with HTS. The British government made clear the Islamist-led rebel group remains a proscribed terrorist organisation, despite it beginning \"diplomatic contact\" with the group.

{"context": "‘I landed my dream theatre role by auditioning on TikTok’\n\nSonny Monaghan shared his audition on TikTok, where it was viewed thousands of times\n\nEarly this year, thousands of people posted videos of themselves singing on TikTok, hoping it could mark the start of their big break. And, for one of them, it did. In January producers of a UK version of Broadway sensation Dear Evan Hansen launched a nationwide hunt for undiscovered talent ahead of a tour later this year. The multi award-winning musical, which first opened in 2016, follows Evan as he goes viral. So it’s possibly not a surprise for that to be a key part of the auditioning process. Director Adam Penford launched the search with - of course - a video saying his team was looking for the \"next generation of talent\". Hopeful actors uploaded audition tapes of themselves singing You Will Be Found - a pivotal song from the play - in the hope of bagging a real-life audition. Producers say fewer than 2% of the 2,000 who applied were invited to audition. From that final 36, Sonny Monaghan was the chosen one and was recently revealed as the understudy for the lead role. Sonny, from East Sussex, tells BBC Newsbeat there was no way he'd have missed the opportunity. \"Evan's a role I've always wanted to play since I started doing musical theatre,\" he says.\n\nA new version of the Broadway hit Dear Evan Hansen is due to tour the UK later this year\n\n\"I just had to make sure that what I put up was at a high enough standard for myself to be like, 'yeah, that's more than good enough to get seen',\" says Sonny. He'll be understudy for former Book of Mormon and Newsies star Ryan Kopel, who plays the lead role of Evan. While Sonny hasn't been to drama school, he did study musical theatre at college and has also had professional acting roles before. He also has an agent. \"I wasn't getting seen for the show,\" he says. \"And I knew I was right for it.\" While he was hoping his agent would help him get in the room, he says the TikTok auditions gave him a chance to take more control of that process. There’s been some criticism of producers for only casting one person found via TikTok, and when the call originally went out some branded it as exploitative and a publicity gimmick. \"I understand the viewpoint,\" says Sonny. \"Like, 'this must have just been some huge marketing thing'. \"It obviously had that element to it anyway. We knew it.\"\n\nDirector Adam Penford has insisted the TikTok auditions were designed to give more people a chance\n\nDirector Adam Penford previously told Newsbeat the production team's goal was \"to democratise the process\" and give those without a drama school background or an agent a chance to be seen. \"If there's somebody who we feel could be in with a chance for performing in the show, they'll be invited to join the professional auditions,\" he said.\n\nThe production company did also use traditional casting methods for professional actors, and says it was open about this from the start. But it insisted that \"every single person stood a chance of being cast, with or without an agent\". \"There were definitely those who recorded who were not suitable for the parts on offer but rightly saw it as an opportunity to be seen by a professional casting team,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nThomas Fag", "continuation": "e was invited to audition alongside professional actors after casting directors saw his TikTok\n\nFor actors like 19-year-old Thomas Fage, from Birmingham, there are no hard feelings. After posting his audition on TikTok, he was one of the 36 people invited to audition again in person but didn't end up making it through. \"The fact they've given people like me and people who just happened to post a video on TikTok the opportunity to even audition and be in the room with real producers or real directors is incredible,\" he says. It was University of Chester student Thomas’s first professional audition - he doesn't have an agent and at the time told Newsbeat even getting that far had been \"beyond [his] wildest dreams\". As he reflects on the casting announcement a few months down the line, he says: \"The advertisement they put out never stated that it'd be guaranteed a role. \"It's giving people like us opportunities that we wouldn't normally get. And for that, I'm completely grateful.\"\n\nProducers say they were \"genuinely thrilled\" by how many people auditioned on TikTok and that there was \"so much talent on show\". Would they cast this way again? \"For the right project, we’d absolutely consider using TikTok again as a way to discover new talent,\" a spokesperson says. \"Asking for TikTok submissions feels considerably more accessible to many.\"\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."}

She woke up to find it had reached tens of thousands of people, more than many posts from the major political parties. “The post was blowing up really quickly,” she says. “I was shocked.” Miles away in Somerset, with political views on the oth", "continuation": "er side of the spectrum, another 16-year-old, Will, was having a similar experience. He had shared clips of politicians he agrees with, highlighting concerns over knife crime and supporting Brexit, and discovered they were racking up hundreds of thousands of views. “I find it incredibly interesting that most of the time I’m the one who is breaking news to people and not the mainstream media,” Will tells me. Unlike Tolu, who posts her views from a personal account alongside takes on music and fashion, Will has created his own logo and posts exclusively about politics. These are just two of dozens of accidental influencers, with a range of political views, to have emerged this general election across the social media sites. Some of their amateur content is getting as much traction as the parties’ own posts - and more than some of their online ads. Plucked from obscurity by the social media sites’ algorithms and pushed into millions of people’s feeds, the accidental influencers’ content can reach an audience who are disengaged from mainstream political commentary.\n\nSeveral users I spoke to said they had been recommended content about Reform UK - such as this clip posted by Will\n\nTheir videos have appeared on the feeds of the younger characters among my Undercover Voters - 24 fictional people with private online profiles and no friends. I created them to investigate what content the algorithms are promoting during the election. About 90% of the political posts on the feeds of the Undercover Voters aged under 35 are not from the parties themselves but from fellow social media users sharing political content. Dozens of the accidental influencers I have identified - aged between 16 and 31 - have received on average about half a million views for each of their posts. Several have had close to a million views on individual videos - and collectively they have racked up more than 15 million. Giving young people a platform can encourage them to voice their opinions and take part in the democratic process - and lots of these profiles are sharing reliable updates and hot takes. But with great virality comes great responsibility - some other accounts like this have shared misleading claims, as well as finding themselves a target for threats and abuse.\n\nSome other viral accounts have shared misinformation, like this faked image of Sir Keir Starmer in a Palesintian flag T-shirt\n\nSeveral of the influencers say they have been told their posts have changed other people’s minds about whether to vote and who for. Some say they have felt encouraged to post the content they know will rack up the most likes, regardless of whether they believe in it. One even says she has been in contact with a political party about her content. Alex, 20, from West Yorkshire says he was encouraged to start posting election content after more UK political posts were pushed to his own feed. His social media feeds used to recommend videos about football, as well as influencer Andrew Tate - who is facing a trial in Romania over rape and trafficking charges. There was some political content in between too, he says, about former US President Donald Trump and some European right-wing politicians. But more recently, the political content has become dominated by posts about Reform UK, usually on the subject of immigration or opposing “wokeism”, he says. Reform UK content has also been recommended to other users who have very different interests to Alex. After Nigel Farage became leader of Reform UK, Alex says he was inspired to make political content on the same topics he had seen on his feed. “I have always liked him,” he says. Within days his posts were reaching tens of thousands of views - equal to many of those from official party accounts.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Marianna Spring: Why am I tracking 24 phones this election?\n\nWhat happened to Alex, Tolu and Will is symptomatic of how social media sites have changed since the last general election. TikTok, Instagram and X all work by recommending content to users’ “For You” pages or feeds - often from people they don’t follow or know, allowing individuals to go viral instantly, without building up a big following first. This evolution means that paid political advertising on some social media sites, like Facebook or Instagram, is getting less attention than the content created by individual users and then promoted by the social media algorithms - including on apps like TikTok, where paid-for political ads are not allowed. Several of the social media users whose political content has gone unexpectedly viral also did not anticipate the hate, trolling and threats which followed. Tolu says she received racist abuse with graphic descriptions about slavery, while Alex says he has received messages threatening to release his home address and details about his family in response to his posts. The BBC is not using the online usernames of the people featured in this story to protect them from the risk of further abuse. While Alex was already sympathetic to Reform UK before its content was pushed into his feed, I spoke to several other users in their 20s - such as 28-year-old Pete who lives in West Yorkshire - who had shown no interest in Reform UK previously, but whose feeds had also become dominated by political content featuring Reform UK talking about immigration. I found the same on my fictional Undercover Voters’ feeds.\n\nPete says his feed has been dominated by Reform UK content, although he went viral with a post urging voters to consider the Green Party\n\nThomas, 30, from Lancashire, told me he had responded to the prominence of Reform UK content by uploading “a fair amount of old clips of Farage speaking in the EU, as it attracts views” even though they do not reflect his own opinions. While we know some reasons why certain content is likely to be promoted - such as whether it is on a topic already generating a lot of engagement - we don’t know exactly why and how social media algorithms choose what to push. On the accounts of my Undercover Voters, I have noticed the political content popping up does not always reflect trends in recent polling, which indicate young people leaning heavily towards Labour. As well as support for Reform UK, the feeds feature criticism of Labour from a left-wing perspective and also backing for the Green Party.\n\nThese viral posts were pushed to our young Undercover Voter profiles in six battleground constituencies\n\nWhile most of these accidental influencer profiles I have spotted have no political affiliations, 21-year-old Kate who runs a left-leaning political account does tell me she has been in contact with the Labour Party about her profile. But she says she is not paid and the party has no control over what she posts. This is the first general election she can vote in, but she has been posting about politics for several years. She says she has racked up 2.1 million likes and more than 18 million views - more than most of the parties’ official TikToks. “In the past, I’ve had people comment they didn’t know something I’ve included and now they wouldn’t vote Tory,” she tells me. The ability to influence other voters, though, comes with risk. Unlike media outlets, which are subject to regulation, there is little oversight of these posts which can reach millions of people.\n\nPosts from the real accidental influencers were spotted on the feeds of our seven fictional Undercover Voter profiles aged under 35\n\nSome of the other profiles which have gone unexpectedly viral have shared misleading posts mixed in with reliable updates and opinions. One posted a doctored image falsely suggesting Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer wore a white T-shirt with the Palestinian flag to watch an England match in Euro 2024, calling him a traitor and provoking abusive comments. Another shared a conspiracy theory falsely suggesting that a milkshake thrown at Nigel Farage while he was out campaigning had actually been staged by his own political party. Other accidental influencer profiles have used graphics of real polls to make misleading predictions about the election outcome - and some have posted incorrect claims about the positions of different political parties on issues such as immigration and Brexit. Georgina, 18, a student in Edinburgh, says it was “quite overwhelming” when her post urging young people to vote Labour, not Green, and giving her opinion that Sir Keir could be replaced as leader after the election, racked up 100,000 views. She thinks many people - like her - are not prepared for going viral during an election campaign. “If you post with the idea that your post could be seen by millions, then you’d probably be a lot more careful about what you’re saying,” she says. “I was concerned that maybe I didn’t provide enough context and official information.”\n\nGeorgina said she wished she had added more context to her post suggesting Sir Keir Starmer could be replaced as Labour leader\n\nSome of these accidental influencers tell me they are putting lots of effort into researching their own posts and ensuring they are accurate. Several also say, though, that they are finding it hard to work out what to share, because they are unsure what to trust on their own feeds. They say opinions can sound like facts and several tell me they have seen a lot of AI-generated content about the election - predominantly parody clips. That includes faked satirical clips that purport to show Sir Keir Starmer, Rishi Sunak and Nigel Farage “live streaming” the video game Minecraft. Other altered images the influencers have come across include a faked image of Rishi Sunak at a Morrisons supermarket made to look like the sign behind him reads “moron”, with his head obscuring part of the brand name. Several people told me that while some of these fakes are obvious, there are others that “blur the line between fact and fiction”.\n\nParody videos of leaders such as Rishi Sunak live-streaming Minecraft were among the AI fakes seen by these influencers\n\nAccording to a TikTok spokesperson, it has increased its investment “in efforts to ensure reliable information can be found on TikTok”, launching a “UK Election Centre with a fact-checking expert” and adopting an “industry-leading AI labelling technology”. It said also does not allow misinformation about the election or bullying and harassment. An X spokesperson previously told the BBC: “X has in place a range of policies and features to protect the conversation surrounding elections.” A spokesperson for Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, has said they have a “UK-specific Elections Operations Centre” to identify threats and misinformation. Following my earlier investigations into misinformation promoted to voters, and deepfaked clips used to smear politicians, sites have also taken action by removing accounts and content."}

Despite picking up a muscle injury in November, he started the week-long endeavour in Liverpool last Sunday in memory of his late teammate Rob Burrow, who died with the illness in June. Crossing the finish line in Saddleworth having raised more than £1m, Sinfield said: \"Since Rob got diagnosed it's taught me that it's important to take some risk - be uncomfortable and be vulnerable and, yeah, that's what we've had to do this week. \"I understood that at some point it could go wrong and I could end up having to stop, but as I said… you'd have had to chop my leg off for that.\"\n\nSinfield added: \"The families we've met, the stories we've heard – the fight, the inspiration, the willingness to stand together to fight MND – has been wonderful wherever we've been.\" He said he was \"delighted\" to be home, and that he wanted to \"rest his body\". Ahead of the last leg, Sir Keir Starmer said in a video message that Sinfield's efforts were \"almost unbelievable in terms of the endurance, the commitment, the dedication\" to \"such an important cause\".

They became friends after playing at Leeds Rhinos and Sinfield has raised more than £11m since he started the epic runs in 2020. Following Burrow's death at the age of 41, his father urged Sinfield to continue the fundraising efforts to tackle the impact of MND. Sinfield described the challenges as \"just going for a run with some mates for a mate\".\n\nSinfield ran past the stadiums of Manchester City (above) and United before reaching his Oldham home\n\nBurrow, who was married with three children, was diagnosed with MND in 2019, after a successful rugby career which included eight Super League Grand Final victories.

{"context": "Diddy accused of dangling woman from high balcony in new case\n\nSean “Diddy” Combs has been accused in a new lawsuit of dangling a woman from the 17th-floor balcony of an apartment during an altercation. The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles by fashion designer Bryana \"Bana\" Bongolan alleges the incident happened in 2016 while she was at the home of Mr Combs' then-girlfriend Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura. It is the latest in more than two dozen lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of several offences, including sexual assault, drugging people, threatening witnesses and causing physical harm. The music mogul is also facing federal charges in a racketeering and sex trafficking scheme. He has denied all the allegations, including the latest claim.\n\nA representative told the BBC on Tuesday that he \"firmly denies these serious allegations\" in the new lawsuit and \"remains confident they will ultimately be proven baseless\". Ms Bongolan says she was spending the night Ms Ventura's apartment when Mr Combs started shouting and banging on the front door, the lawsuit states. After coming inside the home, Mr Combs allegedly confronted Ms Bongolan, who was on the balcony at the time. The lawsuit states he allegedly grabbed and molested her. He then lifted her up and started dangling her from the balcony of the unit, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nAt the time of the incident, Ms Bongolan weighed about 100lb (45.3 kg), according to the lawsuit. It claims Ms Bongolan \"attempted to resist him, throwing her weight back in a desperate struggle to avoid being thrown to the ground and likely to her death\", but Mr Combs \"easily overpowered her\". The lawsuit states that Ms Ventura came outside to intervene, and Mr Combs allegedly pulled Ms Bongolan back over the ledge by slamming her onto patio furniture. A representative for the rapper denied the allegations in a statement to the BBC on Tuesday. \"Anyone has the right to file a lawsuit, regardless of the evidence they may or may not have,\" the statement reads, adding Mr Combs \"has unwavering faith in the facts and in the fairness of the judicial process\".

She is seeking $10m (£7.89m) in damages from the rapper. In the lawsuit, Ms Bongolan alleged that it was a \"culmination of a series of threats, intimidation and violence that coloured many of Ms Bongolan’s interactions with Mr Combs from the day she met him\". The allegations echo an incident noted in a separate lawsuit filed by Ms Ventura against Mr Combs. That lawsuit - which was filed in 2023 and settled the day after - alleged abuse, rape and sex trafficking. It noted an episode at Ms Ventura's apartment when Mr Combs \"picked up one of Ms Ventura’s friends like a child and dangled the friend over the balcony\".

{"context": "No guns for domestic abuse suspects, top US court rules\n\nActress Julianne Moore speaks outside the court during November arguments\n\nPeople placed under restraining orders for suspected domestic violence do not have a right to own guns, the Supreme Court has ruled. The 8-1 decision upholds a 30-year-old law that bars those with restraining orders for domestic abuse from owning firearms. A lower court had struck down that federal statute as not \"consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation\". Friday's ruling marks a rare victory for firearms restrictions in the top court.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts delivered the majority opinion, with all but one of his colleagues in agreement. The policy of disarming alleged domestic abusers is in line with \"what common sense suggests\", he wrote. \"When an individual poses a clear threat of physical violence to another, the threatening individual may be disarmed,\" he said. Justice Clarence Thomas, arguably the most conservative member of the court, was the lone dissenter. He wrote that \"today's decision puts at risk the Second Amendment rights of many more\". At the centre of the case decided on Friday was Zackey Rahimi, a Texas man with a history of armed violence against girlfriends and shootings in public places. In 2020, his then-girlfriend was granted a restraining order by a court after he dragged her into his car, causing her to hit her head on the dashboard during an argument near his Arlington, Texas, home. He also shot at a bystander who witnessed the assault. Despite a court order suspending his handgun licence and barring him from possessing any firearms, he kept his weapons and was involved in five shootings in public later that year. A small-time drug dealer, according to court filings, Rahimi is currently serving a six-year sentence in a Texas federal prison after pleading guilty to violating the court order.\n\nHe is also currently awaiting state charges related to his shooting spree. The US Constitution's Second Amendment guarantees the right \"to keep and bear arms\". In 2022, the US Supreme Court significantly expanded gun rights when it decided the Second Amendment protects a broad right to carry a handgun outside the home for self-defence. It also created a new test for gun laws, specifying they must be rooted in \"historical tradition\". Justice Thomas delivered that opinion. After that decision, Rahimi filed an appeal against his conviction, arguing it did not pass the Supreme Court's new test. In a handwritten letter from jail last year, he also vowed to \"stay away from all firearms and weapons” once he is released. During a November hearing, Rahimi's lawyer, James Matthew Wright, said he could find no historical precedent for people being disarmed, save those convicted of a felony - which does not include the subjects of restraining orders.

Google parent company Alphabet called the case \"incoherent\" in its attempts to get the legal action dropped.

Hosting such adverts is a huge source of revenue for many websites - Ad Tech Collective Action says digital advertising spend reached $490 billion in 2021. It is also an extremely valuable industry for Google, because it dominates web search so heavily. At the core of the claim is the allegation that Google is abusing that dominance, reducing the income websites get. Ad Tech Collective Action says Google has engaged in what is known as \"self-preferencing\" - in other words promoting its own products and services more prominently than that of its rivals.

Wales' finance secretary will publish the budget, which impacts the economy and some taxes paid by people and businesses, on Tuesday afternoon. But with Labour just short of a majority in the Senedd, a deal must be struck with another party in order to get it through. Here is what to look out for.\n\nFirst Minister Eluned Morgan made a big admission recently when she called record-long waiting times for NHS care \"a crisis\". Reduc", "continuation": "ing the backlog of operations created by Covid was the Welsh government's top priority after the pandemic. Three years later - for most of which, Morgan was health minister - and more people than ever are waiting. Health will swallow half this budget, which covers the period up to the next Senedd election in 2026. But Mark Dayan, a policy expert at the Nuffield Trust, says it takes time to improve things. \"What I think we've seen, both when waiting times improved before in the '00s and in some of the cautious improvements we've seen elsewhere in the UK, is even once you start to turn things around it takes a really long period of time before the amount of weeks the average person will be waiting is really significantly changing,\" he said.\n\nIn October, Chancellor Rachel Reeves gave the Welsh government an extra £1bn to spend in this budget. It puts them in \"a different world\" after a long period of spending squeezes and high inflation, says Drakeford. Experts at Cardiff University say it should allow for a boost to NHS spending, external without having to raid other departments. But the picture is not so rosy after 2026, which could create difficult decisions for public services in the not-too-distant future.\n\nMost of those services are run by Wales' 22 local authorities, some of whom have issued dire warnings about their finances. Social care, schools, bin collections, libraries and swimming pools are all provided by councils, which get most of their funding from Drakeford. Yawning gaps have appeared in their budgets and it's not clear how some will balance the books, external. Their leaders argue the NHS cannot be sorted out unless social care is fixed. But the companies delivering care say there's barely enough funding to pay staff the Real Living Wage that the Welsh government wants. Soon they will also have a bigger National Insurance bill as a result of the UK government's Budget.\n\nDrakeford is chuffed Reeves has given him more to spend, but every week in the Senedd opponents attack other big decisions she has taken. They include means-testing pensioners for the winter fuel payment and maintaining the two-child benefits cap. The Scottish government has offered to provide help for people affected. Even though the Welsh government does not have the same powers over the benefits system as Scotland, it will still face calls to help people with the cost of living. It does, however, have some powers over tax, including over a portion of income tax and the land transaction tax you pay when buying a home. They could give ministers some more money to spend. Lots of businesses saw their rates go up after the last budget. But hiking income tax would be a huge decision. The Welsh rates haven't changed since they were devolved in 2019.\n\nEluned Morgan's Labour government needs a deal with another party to get its budget approved\n\nBecause it has fewer than half the seats in the Senedd, Labour cannot make this budget a reality unless it can convince at least one member from another party to back it in a crucial vote next year. We can expect a lot of negotiation and bargaining behind the scenes, if it has not started already. Morgan has tried to up the ante, with a blood-curdling warning about the money Wales loses if her budget fails to pass. Losing votes could also lop 10p off every £1 of income tax, depriving the Welsh government of crucial funds. That might appeal to some, but it would represent a political and financial crisis for the Senedd – and it is difficult to see a government surviving that. Drakeford says the draft of his budget will offer a \"bright future for Wales\". The Welsh Conservatives said social care needed more funding, as did the NHS \"which is at crisis point\". Tory shadow finance minister Peter Fox also called for a \"root and branch review so that taxpayers' money is well-spent and efficiently allocated\". The support of the Welsh Liberal Democrats' sole MS, Jane Dodds, would be enough to pass the budget. Her spokesperson said she wanted more funding for social care, child poverty and rural investment. The last three budgets passed as part of a co-operation deal with Plaid Cymru, which has now ended. Plaid finance spokesperson Heledd Fychan said the first minister should \"fight for a fair deal\" from Keir Starmer's UK government. \"If she fails, then Labour's budget will mean more cuts and NHS funding that delivers ever-diminishing returns,\" she said."}

His series included Trust Me I’m a Doctor, The Truth about Exercise and Lose a Stone in 21 Days, and he became famous for testing out regimes and theories on himself – from injecting snake venom into his own blood to eating tapeworms to see what impact they had on the body.\n\nMillions more knew him for giving advice on BBC One's The One Show and ITV's This Morning. He was also famous for popularising the 5:2 and the Fast 800 diets, which advocate for intermittent fasting and low-carbohydrate meals. Meanwhile, the simple, accessible health tips in his BBC Radio 4 series Just One Thing attracted 25 million listeners around the world, with a TV version announced earlier this year. Mosley launched Just One Thing in 2021, with each episode focusing on a single idea for listeners to improve their health and lifestyle. He presented more than 100 episodes, exploring easy life hacks ranging from taking an early-morning walk and meditating to skipping and eating chocolate. He recorded an edition of the show at last week's Hay Festival, and the most recent episode - about the benefits of eating slowly - was aired on Radio 4 on Thursday morning.\n\nMosley was born in India in 1957, before moving to the Philippines and then being sent to England at the age of seven to attend boarding school. School “wasn't a fantastic period of my life”, he told Radio 4 in 2015. “I actually became happiest, I think, when I went to university. So there was quite a long and relatively unhappy period in which I spent too much time in England at boarding school and far too little time with my family.” He studied PPE (philosophy, politics and economics) at Oxford University before getting a job as an investment banker, but became bored with finance after two years in the job.\n\nHe often makes himself the guinea pig, such as in The Story of Science in 2010\n\nHe retrained as a doctor at the Royal Free Hospital in London, aiming to become a psychiatrist. But rather than using his skills in a medical capacity, he joined the BBC as an assistant producer in 1985. He worked his way through the ranks, becoming producer of science shows like Tomorrow's World, QED and Horizon. Other behind-the-scenes credits include The Human Face, which was presented by John Cleese and featured Elizabeth Hurley, Pierce Brosnan and Sir David Attenborough, and was recognised with an Emmy nomination in 2002. Mosley received Bafta nominations for his work as executive producer on Leonardo, which starred Sir Mark Rylance as the painter, and Pompeii - The Last Day, both in 2003.\n\nHe then moved in front of the camera, after a TV commissioner asked who would present a documentary he had pitched. “I said, ‘I have no idea’, and they said, ‘Why don't you?’ And that's how I came to be on television.” He soon became a household name thanks to programmes like BBC One's Make Me... in 2009, in which he experimented on himself to find out if he could make himself smarter, stay awake and delay ageing. In the name of both science and entertaining TV, other things he put himself through included being exposed to CS gas, entering a contest for eating the world’s hottest chillis, and being filmed having a colon examination. “You do wonder if he’s really a closet masochist getting his kicks courtesy of the licence fee,” the Times newspaper’s TV critic jokingly wrote in 2020. The Telegraph described him as “part-boffin, part-human guinea pig, volunteering to try radical ideas in the name of improving public understanding around the body and mind”.\n\nMichael Mosley pictured filming documentary Blood and Guts for the BBC in 2008\n\nMosley said he got the idea for self-experimentation after making a programme about a scientist who struggled to prove the effectiveness of a treatment for stomach ulcers – and eventually deliberately gave himself one. “I discovered that almost all the great medical discoveries were made by self-experimenters, whether it was vaccines, anaesthetics or whatever,” he told Radio 4 in 2015. “And so I thought, this is a terrific idea.” His 2012 BBC documentary The Truth About Exercise explored who benefitted the most from different types of aerobic training, while 2013's The Truth About Personality followed a similar format but focused on different outlooks on life and how to change them. The same year, he helped bring back Trust Me I'm a Doctor, a programme he had originally produced in the late 1990s. This time he was leading the line-up of presenters who examined a variety of health claims, attracting more than three million viewers. Some of his work has been seen as controversial, including his 2021 series Lose a Stone in 21 Days for Channel 4. He said in the three-part series that it was possible to lose a stone in three weeks by extreme calorie restriction. This received backlash on social media, with eating disorder charity Beat stating they extended the hours of their helpline to support anyone affected by the show. The broadcaster responded that Channel 4 had spoken to Beat “long before the progr", "continuation": "amme went out”. Mosley's diets advocated for a similar approach, with his Fast 800 Diet recommending those wishing to lose weight undertake an 800 calorie-a-day meal plan that is low in carbohydrates and includes Mediterranean foods. His diets attracted a lot of attention, both for their methods and scientific accuracy. But they were popular, and he published numerous books about Fast 800, as well as titles like Fast Exercise, 4 Weeks to Better Sleep, and a companion book to Just One Thing. While qualified as a doctor, Mosley did not remain registered as a medical doctor. He is survived by Clare Bailey, also a doctor and author, and has four children."}
{"context": "One of England's top-rated water companies is using an accounting trick to artificially inflate its balance sheet by more than a billion pounds, BBC Panorama has discovered. Severn Trent Water claims that an investment is worth £1.68bn in its accounts, when in reality it has no value to the overall business. The made-up money makes the company appear more financially robust and helps to support its bumper payouts to shareholders. Severn Trent denies the accounts are misleading and says Panorama's allegations are \"completely inaccurate\".\n\nThe water company - which is regulated by Ofwat - is part of a complex web of companies in the wider Severn Trent plc group. It serves more than eight million people across central England and mid-Wales and has been awarded the Environment Agency's top four-star rating for environmental performance for a record five consecutive years. Its ultimate parent company, Severn Trent plc, is popular with investors, as it has consistently paid large dividends to shareholders. But some of Severn Trent's customers are unhappy. The Shrewsbury-based campaign group Up Sewage Creek wants more of the company's earnings to be used to combat pollution in local rivers. \"They've not updated the infrastructure, they've used our money to enrich themselves and enrich their shareholders,\" one of the campaigners told us. The complex accounting trick started in March 2017 when a shell company, with no money or assets, called Severn Trent Trimpley was set up as part of the group. Another Severn Trent company called Severn Trent Draycote - which owns the water company - agreed to buy Trimpley for £2. Trimpley then issued additional shares and Draycote bought them for a staggering £3bn.\n\nNo money actually changed hands, however, as Draycote paid Trimpley with a £3bn loan note - effectively an IOU. But, on paper, Trimpley immediately appeared to be worth £3bn because it had the IOU. Severn Trent Water then acquired 49% of Trimpley - and that investment was valued in the water company's accounts at £1.47bn. A hugely valuable asset appears to have been created for Severn Trent Water out of thin air.\n\nPanorama discovered the Trimpley investment through the work of retired auditor Stanley Root. He told the programme: \"This is as near to an unreal transaction as you can get - that has just been made up and put into the accounts to make the accounts look better. \"I think it misleads the reader to think that the net assets of Severn Trent Water Limited are higher than they are and that the company is in a much healthier position than it really is. So I think the balance sheet, the financial statements, are misleading.\"\n\nRetired auditor Stanley Root is examining the finances of the UK's 10 largest water and sewerage companies\n\nSince 2017, the made-up money on Severn Trent Water's books has grown in value because of interest payments. Draycote has agreed to pay Trimpley interest on the £3bn IOU, which means the IOU gets bigger each year. As the value of the IOU goes up, so does the paper value of Trimpley. And that means Severn Trent Water's investment in Trimpley rises every year too. The Trimpley investment is now valued at £1.68bn in the regulated water company's 2023/24 accounts. Those accounts were audited and signed off by Severn Trent Water's directors. When referring to the Trimpley investment, the accounts say: \"In the opinion of the directors the fair value of the company's investments are not less than the amount at which they are stated in the balance sheet.\" While that may be technically correct, the £1.68bn value is based on an IOU that is ultimately backed up by Severn Trent Water itself. In the wider group accounts the made-up money is cancelled out by the IOU that Draycote issued, so it is only the balance sheet of the regulated water company, Severn Trent Water, that is inflated.\n\nIs there more to Severn Trent's finances than meets the eye? Watch on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 9 December (20:30 in Northern Ireland and 22:40 in Wales) - and afterwards on iPlayer\n\nSo why do it? Severn Trent told the BBC that Trimpley was set up to allow the water company to legitimately account for future earnings, but that it has never been used for that purpose. Another possible explanation is that Trimpley helps support increased dividends. As well as bolstering the balance sheet, the made-up £1.68bn has also been added to Severn Trent Water's retained earnings - that is the pot of money from which cash can be paid out to shareholders. The more money there is in that pot, the easier it is to justify large dividends. Since Trimpley was added to the accounts in 2017, Severn Trent Water Ltd has paid out £1.615bn in dividends. Profits over the same period were £1", "continuation": ".246bn, so Severn Trent Water has paid out £369m more than it made in profit during that period. It looks like cash is being drained from the regulated water company.\n\nCampaigners in Shrewsbury want more of the company's earnings to be used to combat pollution in local rivers\n\nAuditor Stanley Root says water companies are under great pressure to pay substantial dividends and the Trimpley scheme helps Severn Trent Water deliver. \"It makes the company's balance sheet look more stable than it really is. It gives them the appearance of financial resilience. It helps to support the dividend payments they're making.\" Severn Trent denies that Trimpley has supported shareholder payouts: \"All dividends paid by Severn Trent are justified by earnings and any assertion otherwise is unjustified and wrong.\" However, it is clear that Trimpley is having a dramatic effect on the pot of money from which shareholders can be paid. Severn Trent Water's 2023/24 accounts - which include the £1.68bn investment - report the company has very healthy retained earnings of £1.84bn. But the accounts for the wider Severn Trent Group, where all the creative accounting is cancelled out, show retained earnings of just £7.9m. Severn Trent says: \"Trimpley is an entirely legitimate, legal and transparent structure.\" Its accounts are independently audited and \"any suggestion that we have misled our investors, regulators and customers on the company's finances is false\". It says the IOU is \"very much a real asset\" as it is backed up by other group companies. Severn Trent also says it is in good financial health, it raised an additional billion pounds from shareholders last year and will continue to invest record amounts into infrastructure."}

The Reform UK leader told the BBC that \"of course\" the war was President Vladimir Putin's fault. But he added that the expansion of the EU and Nato gave him a \"reason\" to tell the Russian people \"they're coming for us again\". Former Conservative Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, who is not standing in the election, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Farage was like a \"pub bore we've all met at the end of the bar\". Conservative Home Secretary James Cleverly said Mr Farage was echoing Mr Putin's \"vile justification\" for the war and Labour branded him \"unfit\" for any political office. The former UKIP leader later said he was one of \"the few figures\" that had been \"consistent and honest\" on the issue.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC's Nick Robinson, Mr Farage was challenged over his judgement and past statements, including when he named Russian President Vladimir Putin as the world leader he most admired in 2014. \"I said I disliked him as a person, but admired him as a political operator because he's managed to take control of running Russia,\" Mr Farage said. He was then pressed over a social media post in February 2022, external, when he claimed the Russian invasion of Ukraine was \"a consequence of EU and Nato expansion\". Mr Farage said he had been arguing since the 1990s that \"the ever eastward expansion\" of the Nato military alliance and the EU was giving President Putin \"a reason to [give to] his Russian people to say they're coming for us again and to go to war\". He added: \"We provoked this war. Of course, it's [President Putin's] fault.\" Mr Wallace - who oversaw the UK's response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 - said Mr Farage \"is a bit like that pub bore we've all met at the end of the bar\" and often presents \"very simplistic answers\" to complex problems. He also said the Reform UK leader had been \"consistently wrong\" on the issue, adding: \"Putin isn't really invading Ukraine because of Nato expansion.\" Mr Wallace noted that a 7,000-word essay penned by the Russian leader before the invasion began - that was later seen as outlining his rationale for starting the war - only mentions Nato in a single paragraph. Conservative Home Secretary James Cleverly said, external Mr Farage was “echoing Putin’s vile justification for the brutal invasion of Ukraine\". Labour defence spokesman John Healey said Mr Farage's comments made him \"unfit for any political office in our country, let alone leading a serious party in Parliament\".\n\nFormer Nato Secretary General Lord Robertson accused Mr Farage of \"parroting the Kremlin Line\" and \"producing new excuses for the brutal, unprovoked attack\". During the interview, the Reform UK leader claimed Lord Robertson had agreed the war was caused by the expansion of the EU. \"Saying that we provoked Russia is like saying that if you buy a burglar alarm, in some way you provoke burglars,\" Lord Robertson told Radio 4's The World Tonight. After the interview aired on Friday, Mr Farage said on X (formerly Twitter) that he was \"one of the few figures that have been consistent and honest about the war with Russia\". Alongside the new statement, he reposted a speech in the European Parliament from 2014 in which he called for the West to \"stop playing war games with Putin.\" Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It followed the occupation of the Crimea and Donbas regions in 2014. Ukraine is not a member of the EU or Nato, which is made up of 32 countries across Europe and North America. However, the country applied to join both blocs following the Russian invasion. Nato was formed in 1949 by 12 countries, including the US, UK, Canada and France. After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many Eastern European countries joined including Hungary, Poland and Estonia. The EU has also expanded since the 1990s, with a number of eastern European countries joining in 2004.\n\nIn the interview, Mr Farage also accused the Conservatives of failing to deliver on Brexit. As the leader of UKIP, he was a key figure in the campaign to leave the EU. While the issue dominated the 2019 general election, with Boris Johnson campaigning on the slogan \"Get Brexit Done\", it has not featured prominently in the current campaign. Asked if he stood by his previous claim that Brexit had failed, Mr Farage said: \"No, it's not a failure but we failed to deliver. \"It can't be a failure. We've left the European Union. We're now self-governing.\" But he added: \"Brexit has failed those who voted for it, believing that immigration numbers would be reduced.” Net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and those leaving - has risen sharply since 2021, when the UK left the EU. This has been driven by non-EU nationals coming to the UK. Net migration reached record levels in 2022 before reducing slightly the following year. Reform UK has said it backs a freeze on non-essential immigration to relieve pressure on housing and public services, increase wages and \"protect our culture identity and values\".\n\nMr Farage also criticised the Conservatives for \"binning\" their promise to scrap 4,000 EU laws. Pressed over whether he was just blaming others, Mr Farage said: \"If you put me in charge, it would be very, very different. Of course they didn't do that. \"The Conservative Party never believed in Brexit... They picked it up as a political opportunity, and they failed to deliver.\"\n\nMr Farage also faced questions over his stance on climate change and whether he believed it is not really a \"crisis\". \"I do think ever since the late 1980s that perhaps there's ", "continuation": "been a bit of hype around this, and I think that perhaps is wrong,\" he said. \"All we ever talk about is fear rather than solutions.\" He added: \"We spend too much time hyperventilating about the problem rather than thinking practically and logically what we can do.” Mr Farage branded the Labour and Tory net zero policies \"nonsense\", claiming £30bn a year could be saved by dropping their climate pledges.\n\nHe was also challenged over Reform’s vetting procedures after the party dropped a number of potential parliamentary candidates over inappropriate or offensive comments. The party has blamed a company it hired to conduct background checks on would-be candidates, claiming it failed to carry out vetting before the election was called. Asked why some people with extreme views appeared to rally to his cause, Mr Farage said: “They’re not there because of me.” Despite co-founding the party and being its honorary president, he insisted: “I have had no involvement with the day-to-day running of the party for over three years. “These candidates were recruited before I said I was going to play an active role in the party.” Mr Farage took over as Reform leader from Richard Tice only in the second full week of the election campaign. At the same time he announced he would run as a candidate himself in Clacton after previously saying he would not stand in July's election.\n\nThe BBC is interviewing major party leaders in the run-up to the election in The Panorama Interviews with Nick Robinson.

It did not confirm that he was killed in a strike, saying only that he \"rose as a martyr on the road to Jerusalem\".\n\nThe statement provided no details about Tawil's role in Hezbollah, but the group published photos showing him shaking hands with its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and sitting next the late Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who was assassinated in a US strike in Iraq in 2020.\n\nThe group also announced that its fighters had fired at Israeli forces in the Shtoula area of northern Israel and in the disputed Shebaa Farms/Mount Dov area in the occupied Golan Heights.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it would not comment on foreign media reports about Tawil's death.\n\nHowever, not long after the incident in Khirbet Selim it put out a statement saying that it \"struck a number of areas in Lebanese territory\" after an anti-tank missile was launched towards the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona.\n\n\"Additionally, [Israeli Air Force] fighter jets struck a series of Hezbollah terror targets in Lebanon, including military sites in which Hezbollah terrorists operated,\" it added.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, the IDF said a jet carried out another series of strikes after an aerial defence array intercepted a \"suspicious aerial target\" that crossed from Lebanon, triggering sirens in the Kfar Blum area.\n\nAn Israeli soldier was also lightly injured by an anti-tank missile that was fired towards Mount Dov, it added.\n\nOver the weekend, the IDF's chief spokesman said it had targeted significant military assets of Hezbollah and carried out \"damaging\" strikes on the Radwan Force in an effort to drive them away from the border. It came after a rocket and missile barrage launched from Lebanon damaged an air traffic control base on Mount Meron.\n\nThe cross-border violence over the past three months has already killed dozens of Hezbollah fighters, as well as several Israeli soldiers and Israeli and Lebanese civilians. But so far, Hezbollah has calibrated its actions to prevent a full-scale war with Israel.\n\nLast week, reacting to a suspected Israeli strike that killed Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri and six other people in Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut, Hassan Nasrallah warned Israeli authorities against starting a conflict. \"Whoever thinks of war with us... he will regret it,\" he said.\n\nHowever, crucially, there was no threat from Hezbollah's leader to escalate its actions.\n\nMany in Lebanon still remember the destruction caused by the month-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 and, with Lebanon suffering a massive economic crisis, there is no public support for any military confrontation. Miscalculation, however, is always a risk.\n\nThe Israeli military’s chief of staff has warned Hezbollah that it is ready for another war\n\nAnd, in Israel, some senior figures have touted a potential larger offensive against Hezbollah to reduce the threat posed by the group and allow the return of thousands of residents who have been evacuated because of constant attacks.\n\n\"We'll create a completely different reality [in the north], or we'll get to another war,\" IDF chief of staff Lt Gen Herzl Halevi said on Sunday.\n\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told soldiers at a base in Kiryat Shmona that he wanted to \"send a message to Hezbollah\".\n\n\"Hezbollah made a big mistake with us in 2006 and it is also doing so now. It thought that we were like 'spider's cobwebs'. Suddenly, it sees what kind of 'spider'. It sees great force here, the unity of the people, the determination to do everything necessary to restore security to the north,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course, we prefer that this be done without a wide-ranging campaign, but that will not stop us,\" he added.\n\nThe US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, who has been meeting Arab leaders on his latest regional tour, has been trying to de-escalate tensions.\n\nHe is also expected to call for Israel to reduce the intensity of its fighting in Gaza amid reports of dozens of Palestinians killed in the latest air strikes."}
{"context": "The Labour Party has abandoned longstanding legal action against five former members of staff who have been accused of \"conspiring\" against Sir Keir Starmer’s leadership. The action is estimated to have cost the party millions of pounds, which critics said could otherwise have been spent on the general election campaign. The five included two key figures from the Jeremy Corbyn era – ex- director of communications Seumas Milne and Mr Corbyn’s former chief of staff Karie Murphy. They were accused of leaking a controversial report soon after Sir Keir became the Labour leader in 2020.\n\nA former shadow cabinet member – who did not wish to identified – told the BBC the party should have dropped the legal action earlier. He said: \"This is a huge embarrassment for the party, which has wasted eye-watering sums which could have made the difference in key seats in this election.\" Martin Forde KC, the lawyer who carried out a wide-ranging report into the culture of the party, said: \"It is a great shame that money has been spent on legal fees that could have been spent on the general election.\" Labour had said previously it had been confident of its case. The most recent documents presented in open court last autumn showed that Labour had spent £1.5m on legal action, and estimated it would spend nearly £900,000 more. The party's final costs are likely to be higher, as these figures don’t reflect the full cost of the litigation. But it’s not clear if the party will meet the costs of those i", "continuation": "t claimed had leaked the controversial report. In a statement to the court, Labour officials claimed that the five \"entered into a conspiracy to use unlawful means… to provide a copy (or copies) of the Report to the press\" to damage the party \"under the leadership of its then new leader, Keir Starmer\".\n\nJeremy Corbyn and Keir Starmer on the campaign trail in 2019\n\nThrough their lawyers, the five had \"strenuously denied, and have consistently denied, any involvement or complicity in the leak whatsoever\". A very senior official in the party previously described the legal action to the BBC as a \"gamble\". And concerns had been raised privately about pursuing it by some Starmer supporters who were no fans of the Corbyn leadership. The 860 page leaked document ostensibly examined the handling of antisemitism complaints under Mr Corbyn’s leadership. But it was a lot more than that. The report's contention was that anti-Corbyn staffers had impeded progress on antisemitism complaints, and it suggested some of them had diverted funds away from certain constituencies in the closely-fought 2017 election which the party needed to win. But perhaps the most controversial aspect was the inclusion of unredacted emails and WhatsApp messages from Corbyn critics, which laid bare internal tensions and factionalism. Some of the messages contained derogatory comments about pro-Corbyn MPs and staff.\n\nA subsequent report, external into the leak and the wider culture in the party by Mr Forde found, for example, \"the criticisms of Diane Abbott are not simply a harsh response to perceived poor performance – they are expressions of visceral disgust\". The report had been intended as a submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which was, at the time, in the process of completing what would be a highly-critical report of the party’s response to complaints of antisemitism during the Corbyn leadership. Following legal advice, the party’s then general secretary Jennie Formby did not submit the document to the EHRC and decided it should not be made public, but it was leaked early in April 2020, within a week of Starmer becoming party leader. Even though the party was under new management following Starmer’s election as leader, it faced legal action from nine people - most of whom had made antisemitism complaints - who said their privacy and data had been breached. Labour named the five it considered responsible, including three more ex-staffers - Georgie Robertson, Harry Hayball and Laura Murray, who had been closely involved in drawing up the report – and took legal action with the aim of making them, and not the party, predominantly liable for any damages. But even when the nine people who had alleged that their data had been breached discontinued their legal action in September last year, the party continued to pursue the five to try recover some of its mounting costs.\n\nHigh Court documents set out Labour’s case against the five – including suggestions that they had discussed leaking the document as part of a communications strategy in 2020. The lawyers for the five said what had been discussed had been instead a \"rough plan\" to brief \"a narrative’ of the document to the press - with any confidential information redacted – but only in the event it was submitted to the EHRC, which never happened. None of the five, their lawyers said, had considered the disclosure of the full unredacted report and they had condemned the leaking of the full document as \"reckless and foolish\" and not politically sensible. Perhaps more significantly, three inquiries or investigations into the leak had been conducted. The party itself appointed an independent investigator, Morag Slater, whose report was unable to name the leakers. The wide-ranging Forde report in to the party’s culture concluded in 2022: \"We could not identify the source of the leak.\" And the Information Commissioners Office - the UK’s data watchdog - told the BBC 18 months ago that it had found \"insufficient evidence\" that \"any individual had unlawfully obtained or disclosed personal data\". A joint statement from Labour and from lawyers for the five states: \"The party is discontinuing its legal claims against Karie Murphy, Seumas Milne, Georgie Robertson, Harry Hayball and Laura Murray on a ‘no order as to costs’ basis. The five welcome the resolution of the claims.\" It is understood neither Labour nor the five have paid costs to each other. With Jeremy Corbyn now expelled from Labour’s ranks, and standing against the party at the general election, the current leadership is likely to be relieved too that this long-running reminder of party infighting has concluded - but not without a political and financial cost."}

It was a difficult game. I'm asking 18-year-olds to do difficult jobs. He's an international, he's won the Champions League, he's a senior player.

But the original case fell apart amid challenges from the Hollywood star's lawyers and the initial team of prosecutors stepped down.\n\nThe new prosecution team dismissed the charge in April 2023 over evidence that the gun may have been modified, causing it to malfunction and discharge without the trigger being pulled.\n\nBut, as prosecutors weighed whether to refile charges in light of their new forensic results, judges had put several civil lawsuits against Mr Baldwin and other Rust producers on hold.\n\nA low-budget independent flick, Rust was said to be a passion project for Mr Baldwin.

{"context": "Blake Lively has filed a legal complaint against It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni, alleging sexual harassment and a campaign to \"destroy\" her reputation. According to the legal filing, she accuses Mr Baldoni and his team of attacking her public image following a meeting in which she brought along her actor husband, Ryan Reynolds, to address \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Mr Baldoni and a producer on the movie. Mr Baldoni's legal team told the BBC the allegations are \"categorically false\" and said they hired a crisis manager because Ms Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met. In the romantic drama, Ms Lively plays a woman who finds herself in a relationship with a charming but abusive boyfriend, played by Mr Baldoni.\n\nThe meeting between Ms Lively and Mr Baldoni, together with others involved in the movie's production, took place on 4 January this year, and it aimed to address \"the hostile work environment\" on set, says the legal filing. Ms Lively's husband, Deadpool star Mr Reynolds, who did not appear in It Ends With Us, joined her at the showdown, according to the legal complaint, which is one step before a lawsuit. Mr Baldoni, 40, attended the meeting in his capacity as co-chairman and co-founder of the company that produced the film, Wayfarer Studios. He was also the film's director. In the legal complaint, Ms Lively's lawyers allege that both Mr Baldoni and the Wayfarer chief executive officer, Jamey Heath, engaged in \"inappropriate and unwelcome behavior towards Ms Lively and others on the set of It Ends With Us\". In the filing to the California Civil Rights Department, a list of 30 demands relating to the pair's alleged misconduct was made at the meeting to ensure they could continue to produce the film. Among them, Ms Lively, 37, requested that there be no more mention of Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath's previous \"pornography addiction\" to Ms Lively or to other crew members, no more descriptions of their own genitalia to Ms Lively, and \"no more adding of sex scenes, oral sex, or on camera climaxing by BL [Blake Lively] outside the scope of the script BL approved when signing onto the project\", says the complaint.

She alleges this was \"the intended result of a carefully crafted, coordinated, and resourced retaliatory scheme to silence her, and others from speaking out about the hostile environment that Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath created\". Responding to the legal complaint, Mr Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said on Saturday: \"It is shameful that Ms Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.\" Mr Freedman accused Ms Lively of making numerous demands and threats, including \"threatening to not show up to set, threatening to not promote the film\", which would end up \"ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\". He alleged that Ms Lively's claims were \"intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media\". In a statement via her attorneys to the BBC, Ms Lively said: \"I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\" She also denied that she or any of her representatives had planted or spread negative information about Mr Baldoni or Wayfarer.\n\nThe film was a box-office hit, although some critics said it romanticised domestic violence. Soon after the release date in August, another co-star, Brandon Sklenar, hinted in an Instagram post at rumours of a rift between Ms Lively and Mr Baldoni. Speculation of a falling out only grew when they did not appear together on the red carpet. It Ends With Us tells the story of Boston florist Lily Bloom, played by Ms Lively, as she navigates a love triangle between her charming but abusive boyfriend, Ryle Kincaid, played by Mr Baldoni, and her compassionate first love, Atlas Corrigan, played by Mr Sklenar. It is based on a best-selling novel by Colleen Hoover. The 45-year-old author has previously said her inspiration was domestic abuse her mother endured.\n\nLively posed for photos with Sklenar (left) and her husband Ryan Reynolds at the premiere, but not her co-star Baldoni\n\nIn an interview with the BBC at the film's premiere in August, Ms Lively said she had felt the \"responsibility of servicing the people that care so much about the source material\". \"I really feel like we delivered a story that's emotional and it's fun, but also funny, painful, scary, tragic and it's inspiring and that's what life is, it's every single colour,\" said the actress. Ms Lively, who is also credited as a producer, told the BBC she felt the film had been made \"with lots of empathy\". \"Lily is a survivor and a victim and while they are huge labels, these are not her identity,\" said Ms Lively. \"She defines herself and I think it's deeply empowering that no one else can define you.\""}

{"context": "Harlow Collinge was taken to hospital, but died four days later\n\nA childminder who admitted shaking and killing a nine-month-old baby boy she was supposed to be looking after has been jailed for 12 years and seven months for manslaughter. Karen Foster, 62, left Harlow Collinge with unsurvivable brain injuries after he had been dropped off at her home by his mother Gemma Collinge, the court heard. Harlow was taken to hospital from the address in Hapton, near Burnley, Lancashire, on 1 March, 2022, but died four days later. Following sentencing, his family said they had lost their son \"in the most horrific of circumstances\".\n\nFoster was due to stand trial at Preston Crown Court for his murder last week but the prosecution accepted a plea of manslaughter. The basis of her plea was that her \"forceful shaking\" caused Harlow's death after he fell out of his high chair and began crying, the court heard. Foster, a registered childminder with nine years experience, called 999 to say he was not breathing, and told a paramedic he had \"suddenly collapsed\". After Harlow was rushed away by ambulance, Foster hugged his mother at the hospital and claimed the youngster had begun choking and that she had slapped him on the back. But she later tried to blame Ms Collinge for the injuries. Harlow died days later in his parents’ arms having suffered massive brain injuries.\n\nFoster, despite claiming benefits for ill health, had been breaking Ofsted rules on the numbers and ages of children she should have been caring for, to make more money from parents, the court heard. Relatives of Harlow shouted \"scumbag\" and \"I hate you\" as Foster was led away from the dock after being sentenced by High Court judge Mr Justice Barry Cotter. The judge described Harlow as a \"happy, healthy, much-loved\" boy, but said that Fost", "continuation": "er, despite ill health and pain in her hip, chose to carry on looking after more children than she should have under Ofsted rules, and this had contributed to her \"loss of temper\". He said: \"I have no doubt you snapped on the 1st of March 2022, in part due to the fact that you were not coping with the demands of caring for four children. \"You lost your temper and he was on the receiving end. \"You shook an (almost) 10-month-old child so violently to cause devastating injuries. His death was caused in the course of an assault.\" In a statement, Harlow's family said: \"We do not know where to begin explaining what it is like losing our son in the most horrific of circumstances. \"Our boy’s life has been taken away by a horrible, fake individual, who we trusted and who promised to care for him. \"No words can describe how it has ruined our lives.\"\n\nHarlow's mother, father Allen Frangleton, older siblings and wider family, sat in the public gallery, weeping as Foster's case was heard and their victim impact statements were read out. Ms Collinge spoke of the \"guilt\" she felt, having made arrangements to move Harlow to a nursery six weeks after first using Foster as a childminder, due to her own concerns about the number of children being looked after. \"All the red flags I missed,\" she continued before recalling Foster trying to comfort her at the hospital, claiming Harlow had choked on pasta.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nShe added: \"She even put her arms around me.

And when pressed on his plan to remove VAT tax breaks from private schools, the Labour leader said he wanted to tackle a lack of resources in state schools. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he appreciated people's frustrations with the government as he acknowledged that levels of tax and immigration were \"too high\". He also apologised again for leaving the D-Day commemorations early and for Covid rule-breaking in government. Responding to a disgruntled former Conservative activist who said she felt \"ashamed\" of the government, Mr Sunak said he was trying to rebuild trust through his actions and by \"making progress on the things that matter to people\" such as economic stability.

After a brief pause and audience laughter, Sir Keir talked about his former roles working with the police in Northern Ireland and in the Crown Prosecution Service saying there's been a \"constant theme in my life of trying to serve the public\". He was repeatedly asked why he backed Jeremy Corbyn in the general election 2019 but was now disparaging the former leader. Sir Keir said he was \"certain that we would lose the 2019 election\" and that he campaigned for Labour because he wanted \"good colleagues\" to keep their seats in Parliament. Asked why he had shifted positions on subjects since taking over from Mr Corbyn as leader, Sir Keir said: \"When you lose that badly you don’t look to the voters and say 'what on earth do you think you were doing', you look at your party and say 'we have to change'.\" One audience member told Sir Keir he feared being priced out of private schools due to Labour's plans to remove VAT tax breaks. The Labour leader said he had nothing against private schools and recognised that parents \"work hard and save hard\" to send their children there. However, he added that \"every parent has aspiration for their children whether they go to private school or not\". He said money raised through his private school policy would help recruit 6,500 teachers for state secondary schools. Asked what he feared the most about potentially becoming prime minister, the Labour leader spoke of his concern about how becoming prime minister could affect his teenage children.

On the economy, the prime minister said he knew things were “not easy” but that he had been taking action to make things “that little bit easier” by trying to bring down inflation.

{"context": "Gisèle Pelicot lifts her sunglasses and chooses to fight back\n\nWarning: This story contains descriptions of alleged sexual offences.\n\nThere was a moment, a few weeks into the trial, when Gisèle Pelicot decided it was time to remove her sunglasses. It wasn't just an acknowledgment of the fading autumn sunshine in the medieval southern French city of Avignon. It was also an indication that she'd passed a milestone – one of many that have marked her slow, painful journey from serene grandmother, to anguished and shame-haunted rape victim, to fearful courtroom witness, to global icon of courage and defiance. \"She had these sunglasses she used to hide her eyes… to protect her intimacy,\" said Stéphane Babonneau, the youthful criminal lawyer who for two years has guided Mrs Pelicot through the case against her ex-husband, Dominique, and fifty other men now on trial for allegedly raping her. \"But there was a point when she felt she no longer needed to protect herself. She didn't need [the glasses],\" Mr Babonneau explained, seizing on that moment as a way to illustrate the slow transformation of a \"sincere… very humble person\", who had begun the trial \"extremely worried\", shocked by the blaze of publicity, and still feeling \"very ashamed of what had happened to her\".\n\nThe Big Cases: My Husband the Monster The shocking story of Gisele Pelicot, raped by strangers her husband invited to abuse her.\n\nOver the course of the trial, Gisèle Pelicot, 72, has said almost nothing about her ordeal, beyond the occasional and brief comment to supporters gathered in Avignon's Palais de Justice. But Mr Babonneau, speaking now with his client's blessing, has begun giving us insights into the way she's handled herself in court, and the way she has slowly and methodically sought to rebuild her life and, to a limited extent, her peace of mind. Another moment - and milestone - sticks out. It was earlier this year, in May. Mr Babonneau and his colleague Antoine Camus had been trawling through some of the 20,000 grotesquely explicit videos and photographs that police discovered back in 2020 on Dominique Pelicot's computer hard drive. A grim task. The videos were \"absolutely disgusting,\" said Mr Babonneau. But it was the audio that was almost more shocking. \"It's possible to hear Mrs Pelicot snoring… to hear her breathing. It's even more disturbing to listen to her choking when some of the men are abusing her. The sound was very important [evidence].\"\n\nThe Big Cases: My Husband the Monster The shocking story of Gisele Pelicot, raped by strangers her husband invited to abuse her.\n\nMr Babonneau knew that without those videos, \"most likely there would have been no trial, no case\". Mrs Pelicot understood that too, but could easily and understandably have decided, for her own sanity, to avoid watching any of the footage herself. Instead, Mr Babonneau remember", "continuation": "s, she simply announced one day: \"I'm ready now.\" So, she sat down beside the two men, in their office, as they introduced a carefully selected portion of each video, explaining who the men were, and what she would be seeing them do to her. Then Mr Babonneau pressed play and images of the Pelicots' bedroom, in their bungalow in the village Mazan, flashed up on the screen. \"How could he?\" she eventually asked, in her quiet voice. It was a phrase she would keep repeating over the coming days. Then a little later, she noted the date on one of the videos. \"That was my birthday evening.\" \"That happened in [my] daughter's bed. In her beach house.\" Mr Babonneau remembers Mrs Pelicot's sustained indignation, but noted too that she never cried, and that with the help of experts, she'd managed \"to put an impressive distance between what she was seeing and her mental health.\" The lawyers saw this moment as a \"final test\" that showed their client had regained \"some kind of equilibrium\" in the four years since 4 November 2020, when she'd been informed about her husband's actions and \"her world was destroyed.\" She was now ready to face the rigours of a public trial.\n\nMrs Pelicot had wanted to watch the footage in order to understand who all these men were, and to help fill in the gaps in her memory, caused by the years of being drugged by her husband. \"She has entire pieces of her existence that don't exist in her mind,\" explained Mr Babonneau. The same practical concerns first shaped her decision to opt for a public trial, and to push for the videos to be shown in open court. She was beyond angry, for sure. But at that stage she wasn't looking to change the world. She was simply nervous about the idea of spending months inside a closed courtroom packed with dozens of her abusers. A public trial would, she thought, feel less intimidating. The first day of the trial was still traumatic. Sunglasses on, Mrs Pelicot was revealing herself in public for the very first time. And it got worse. Walking beside her up the steps towards the courthouse, Mr Babonneau noticed and recognised some of the accused men, in masks. But Mrs Pelicot only slowly became aware that she was now surrounded by them, elbows bumping as they jostled to get through the same security barriers. \"It was stressful for her. She was surprised how casual everything seemed to be,\" recalled Mr Babonneau. And then came the moment – the first in four years – when Gisèle and Dominique Pelicot's eyes met across the crowded courtroom. Their chairs were arranged as if to make such contact unavoidable. \"I saw sometimes that they exchanged looks,\" Mr Babonneau noted. Gisèle had spoken repeatedly to her team of her concern about how she might react in that first encounter.\n\nWe know now, of course, that while giving evidence in court Dominique Pelicot confessed to everything and that he begged his family for forgiveness. We also know that Gisèle Pelicot has not forgiven him. \"For sure, no. She cannot forgive him,\" said Mr Babonneau. And yet, the couple were once deeply in love. They were married for fifty years. And in the courtroom, Mr Babonneau could tell, the former couple were not able to ignore their shared past entirely. So, what did the lawyer see in those glances they exchanged? It was like they were saying \"look at us,\" said Mr Babonneau. He felt they were communicating to each other a shared sense of disbelief. Almost as if they were, briefly, spectators watching the agonies of two strangers. \"How did we end up here?\"\n\nDuring the trial, defence lawyers for various accused men tried to suggest that Gisèle's composure, her lack of tears, somehow implied that she was complicit in her own abuse. Or that she felt sympathy for Dominique Pelicot. \"When a victim doesn't cry, or cries too much, there is always something to criticise,\" said Mr Babonneau, with a flicker of contempt. But while the attacks clearly rattled Mrs Pelicot, she also told her legal team not to worry. There was a simple reason for that. Nothing that the lawyers could throw at her in court could ever compare with the very worst moment of her life, that day in November 2020, when an officer had sat her down at Carpentras Police Station and showed her the first grim images that investigators had extracted from her husband's hard drive. \"You know I survived 2 November 2020, so I'm ready for everything now,\" Babonneau remembers her saying.\n\nAs the trial went on, Gisèle Pelicot was surprised to find that public and media interest was not drifting away, as she and her team had imagined it would. Instead, she began receiving letters and gifts and applause from cheering crowds. \"When she started receiving these letters, she felt some kind of responsibility for victims who had suffered similar things,\" said Babonneau. She came to understand the uniqueness of her case – that the video evidence meant it was not simply \"the word of the victim against the word of the suspect\", and that she now had a rare opportunity \"to change society\". \"I'm lucky to have the evidence. I have the proof, which is very rare. So, I have to go through [all this] to stand for all the victims,\" she told Mr Babonneau. Her lawyer noticed, again, his client's \"simple,\" practical nature. She has no interest in being \"an activist\", but is simply thinking of how her experience of being drugged without realising it, could now help make other women aware of the issue, and look out for possible signs of similar abuse. Had she known then what all of France knows now, perhaps she could have put an end to her ordeal. And maybe other women can now do the same.\n\nAs for the future, Mrs Pelicot may, perhaps, break her silence with a few interviews in the months ahead. But she's made it clear she wants \"to remain an individual… she wants to live a very simple life.\" And while she may never forgive her once \"perfect\" ex-husband, she has found a way to manage her memories of him and to cling on to the \"happy moments\" they once shared. Some psychiatrists argue that Dominique Pelicot is a relatively typical psychopath – a high-functioning narcissist with no capacity for empathy who weaved between his sordid hidden life and the self-gratifying role of playing of a family man. Gisèle Pelicot sees things more simply, embracing the idea, put forward at the trial, of a split personality.

Holly Newton's mother Micala Trussler voiced her concerns in response to a new survey suggesting 49% of teenagers in a relationship in the last year have experienced violent or controlling behaviour from their partner. \"My biggest fear is if children can't access the support they need that they're then going to end up in the same position as Holly and potentially be murdered,\" she warned. Jess Phillips, minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, described the results of the Youth Endowment Fund (YEF) survey as \"heartbreaking and deeply concerning\".\n\nHolly was 15 when she was stabbed to death by her ex-boyfriend in an alleyway in Hexham, Northumberland, in January 2023. Logan MacPhail, who was 16 at the time, had been \"filled with resentment\" after she ended their relationship, his trial heard. He was found guilty of her murder and sentenced to life detention with a minimum of 17 years. Ms Trussler has been campaigning for the age a person can be legally recognised as a domestic abuse victim to be lowered - currently the law requires both the abuser and the victim to be over 16.\n\nHolly Newton was killed in January 2023 by a jealous ex-boyfriend\n\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Ms Trussler said: \"Children need to be safeguarded in all different situations but this domestic abuse for under-16s is just not being acknowledged. \"We need to see change, otherwise children in a situation like Holly's could be murdered as well.\" Ms Trussler and Holly's step-dad, Lee Trussler, deliver talks in schools about abusive relationships and want children to be able to talk to a trusted adult if they find themselves in one. But Mr Trussler said without a change to domestic abuse laws getting help for children affected could be difficult as it would be down to the adult to find a solution. \"If the law was changed charities could help with evacuation plans, the police could get involved as well, but there's just not that help there at the moment,\" he said.\n\nThe findings of the YEF survey, shared exclusively with the BBC, shed light on how widespread coercive control and violence is in young people's relationships. The charity, which was given £200m by the Home Office to fund and evaluate anti-violence projects, asked more than 10,000 children aged 13-17 in England and Wales about their experiences. It found 27% of respondents had been in a romantic relationship during the past year. Of those, almost half said they had been subject to controlling behaviours, such as having their partner check who they had been talking to on their phone. Almost one in three said they had experienced some form of physical or sexual violence, while a fifth reported being pressured or forced into sexual activities to which they did not consent.\n\nYEF chief executive Jonathan Yates said the survey had revealed \"a shocking and pretty depressing set of findings\". Although the study does not draw any conclusions as to why teenagers are experiencing violent and controlling behaviour, Mr Yates had some suggestions about what could be behind the figures. \"Obviously we should be worried about is what's going on online for a lot of our children,\" he said. \"A third of all teenage children said that they've seen violence against women and girls being promoted online.\"\n\nHigh-quality education for young people is key, says YEF's Jon Yates\n\nTo help counter such content, Mr Yates said the first step was for the government to be \"really serious about providing proper high-quality content in schools about spotting the signs of violence in relationships\". At 58%, teens aged 13-15 were more likely to report violent or controlling experiences in their relationships than older teens. For those aged 16-17, the figure was 42%. In contrast to domestic abuse in adults, the survey found boys in relationships are more likely to say they experience violent or controlling behaviours (57%) compared to girls (41%).\n\n\"What we're calling for today is really high-quality lessons and sessions from trained teachers or youth workers on how to stay safe in relationships,\" said Mr Yates. While schools do teach lessons on healthy relationships", "continuation": ", the survey suggests topics such as consent may not be reaching those who most need it. Martha, 18, from near Manchester, is on the YEF's Youth Advisory Board. She said other pupils would skip sex and relationships education more than other lessons, due to a lack of consequences. She added there was still a lot of stigma around talking about less healthy relationships. “We're told what an unhealthy relationship is like, but at no point did they tell us what a good one is,\" she said. Fellow advisory board member Hanzala Minhas, 19, from Bradford, is currently studying in Cornwall. He said: \"You don't want young adults going into the future where they feel like these kinds of behaviours are the norm, because they're not and I feel like it's going to affect society as a whole because people will feel like they can't get into healthy relationships.\"\n\nAccording to the survey, 76% of students received some form of education on dating and relationships in the past year. The topic most commonly reported as having been taught was sexual consent at 55%. The second highest was harassment, at 43%. Additionally, only 40% said they had received lessons on how to be in healthy and respectful romantic relationships. Children who admit to perpetrating sexual violence were even less likely to say they had received lessons on consent and harassment than the average – only 39% and 31% respectively.\n\nResponding to YEF's findings, Phillips said the government was committed to using \"every tool at our disposal\" to halve violence against women and girls in a decade. \"Prevention and education are absolutely fundamental to our approach and we’re considering a range of actions to address teenage relationship abuse, including supporting our education system to teach children about respectful and healthy relationships and consent,\" she said.\n• None If you've been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, you can access information and support via BBC Action Line."}

Excited crowds watched on as the monarch and his family headed into St Mary Magdalene Church, Norfolk. A woman who previously had ovarian cancer told the BBC she was able to wish the King and Catherine well after their own cancer diagnoses. It was announced last week that Prince Andrew would not attend the annual gathering after an alleged Chinese spy was found to have links to the royal. The service took place hours before the King's Christmas message is due to air - it will be delivered from a former hospital chapel.\n\nThe King, Queen Camilla, Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales were joined by the prince and princess's three children - Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.\n\nAlso in the walking party were the Princess Royal, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh and their children Lady Louise Windsor and the Earl of Wessex.\n\nThe royals were greeted at the foot of the steps of the church by the Reverend Canon Dr Paul Rhys Williams. Inside, the National Anthem was sung before the first hymn, O Come, All Ye Faithful. The Christmas morning church service is a big event in the royal calendar, bringing together the Royal Family for a public appearance, with crowds and photographers capturing the moment. Afterwards, the royals spend Christmas at their Sandringham estate, which has been the customary seasonal meeting place for the family since 1988.\n\nCrowds gathered early on Wednesday to catch a glimpse of the annual tradition\n\nShelly from Shrewsbury in Shropshire said she had joined the crowds for the first time this year to support the King and Catherine. Earlier this year, the pair announced their cancer diagnoses within weeks of each other - the King in February and the princess the following month. \"I was spending Christmas on my own and I wanted to turn a negative into a positive and I wanted to be here, really, for Catherine and Charles because of the journey that they've had,\" Shelly told the BBC. \"She [Catherine]'s had a really tough year, and I just want to give my support\". Also in the crowd was Diane from Oldham who shook hands with the King, Prince William and Catherine and their youngest son Prince Louis. She told the BBC that it meant a lot to her, as an ovarian cancer survivor, to speak to the royals. Diane said she was able to wish the King and Catherine good health for the new year, and that she has written to Catherine on various occasions about cancer and has had \"lovely replies\". \"People don't realise how it [cancer] does affect you as a family, so I wanted to be here to see the whole family and see them celebrate Christmas.\"\n\nWhile Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah, the Duchess of York did not attend the service, their daughter Prin", "continuation": "cess Beatrice - accompanied by her husband, property tycoon Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, and his son Christopher Woolf from a previous marriage - did.

The man, reported to have been part of an operation to get close to figures of influence, was described by judges of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission court as having an \"unusual degree of trust\" with the prince. Prince Andrew's office said nothing sensitive had ever been discussed with Mr Yang. The prince is seldom seen in public since apologising for his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and no longer takes part in frontline royal duties. Later on Christmas Day, the monarch's traditional speech was broadcast as usual on television and radio. It was recorded earlier this month in the Fitzrovia Chapel, central London, and marks the first time in more than a decade that the Christmas message has been recorded from a place that is not in a royal palace or estate. Fitzrovia was once the chapel of Middlesex Hospital. The location suggests that healthcare and supporting community links could be themes for the annual speech.\n\nKensington Palace released a video in September which showed Catherine announcing that she had completed her chemotherapy treatment, and promoted the message that \"out of darkness can come light\". She recently marked her biggest return to royal duties after finishing chemotherapy by hosting a carol service at Westminster Abbey. The event was dedicated to individuals who have shown love, kindness and empathy to their communities. Meanwhile, the King's regular sessions of treatment continue, but as a sign of a positive response he has plans for a busy schedule of engagements and overseas trips in 2025."}

A ship named as Eagle S is suspected of damaging the Estlink 2 cable and Finnish coast guard crew have boarded the oil tanker and steered it into Finnish waters. The EU said the Eagle S was part of \"Russia's shadow fleet\" and the failure of the undersea cable was the \"latest in a series of suspected attacks on critical infrastructure\", external. Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said the Raju had set sail early on Friday and he believed Finland would join the operation to protect the remaining cable.\n\nHe told Estonian public radio that the Raju's task was \"to ensure that nothing happens there and that our critical connection with Finland remains operational\". The Kremlin has declined to comment on the damage to the cable, describing it as a \"very narrow issue\" and not an issue for the Russian presidency.

Estonia's power supply has been dramatically reduced after its 170km (105-mile) Estlink 2 cable was shut down. In its initial assessment on Thursday, Finland's Fingrid company said repairs to the cable could last until the end of July 2025. The damage to Estlink 2 is the third incident in little more than a month in the Baltic Sea.\n\nLast month, two data cables were severed: the Arelion cable between the Swedish island of Gotland and Lithuania on 17 November, and then the C-Lion 1 cable was damaged between the Finnish capital, Helsinki, and the German port of Rostock. A Chinese ship, the Yi Peng 3, was suspected of dragging its anchor over the cables in a separate act of Russian sabotage. In October 2023, another Chinese ship ruptured an undersea gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia. The Yi Peng 3 and Eagle S are both suspected of being part of a so-called shadow fleet of oil tankers that Russia is using to avoid Western sanctions imposed since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe Yi Peng 3 eventually set sail from the Kattegat strait last week\n\nThe EU said it was working on measures including sanctions to target \"Russia's shadow fleet, which threatens security and the environment\". After several weeks at anchor in the Kattegat strait between Sweden and Denmark, the Chinese tanker was eventually boarded by authorities from Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Finland, but then set sail last week. By contrast, Finnish authorities said they had boarded the Cook Islands-registered Eagle S in the early hours of Thursday and it was escorted towards the Finnish coast off Porkkala, across the Gulf of Finland from Tallinn. \"Our patrol vessel travelled to the area and could determine visually that the vessel's anchor was missing,\" said Markku Hassinen, deputy head of the Finnish Border Guard, told a news conference. The Estonian prime minister sought to reassure Estonians on Thursday that they would continue to have secure power supplies. The two main power companies, Elering and Eesti Energia, had various reserve and back-up power plants, he told reporters. However, he added that it was impossible to protect every square metre of the seabed at all times."}

Both of the former zoo animals are kept under tight security at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya.\n\nUnable to reproduce, the species is technically extinct. But now the Biorescue team has turned to radical fertility science to bring these animals back from the brink.\n\nThey started their work using southern white rhinos. This close cousin of the northern whites has a population of thousands - and is considered a conservation success story although it's still threatened by illegal hunting.\n\nThe project has taken years and has had to overcome many challenges: from working out how to collect eggs from the two-tonne animals, to creating the first-ever rhino embryos in a lab and trying to establish how - and when - to implant them.\n\nIt has taken the Biorescue team many years to work out how to create and then transfer a rhino embryo\n\nIt took 13 attempts to achieve the first viable IVF pregnancy using southern white rhinos.\n\n\"It's very challenging in such a big animal, in terms of placing an embryo inside the reproductive tract, which is almost 2m inside the animal,\" Susanne Holtze told BBC News.\n\nThe embryo, which was made using an egg from a female southern white from a zoo in Belgium and fertilized with sperm from a male in Austria, was transferred into a southern white surrogate female in Kenya, who became pregnant.\n\nHowever, the success was followed by tragedy.\n\nThe pregant southern white surrogate sadly died from an infection caused by bacteria found in the ", "continuation": "soil\n\nSeventy days into the pregnancy, the surrogate mother died after becoming infected with Clostridia - a bacteria found in the soil that can be deadly to animals.\n\nThe death dealt a blow to the team - a post-mortem revealed that the 6.5cm male foetus was developing well and had a 95% chance of being born alive.\n\nBut it showed that the technique had worked and that a viable pregnancy through rhino IVF was possible. Now the next step is to try this using northern white rhino embryos.\n\nThere are only 30 of these precious embryos in existence, stored in liquid nitrogen in Germany and Italy.\n\nThey were created using eggs harvested from Fatu, the younger female in Kenya, and sperm collected from two male northern white rhinos before they died.\n\nSome of the precious northern white embryos are held at Berlin's Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research\n\nHowever, the birth of a northern white calf will require another scientific first.\n\nNeither of the last two surviving northern whites can carry a pregnancy because of a combination of age and health problems. So instead the embryo will be implanted into the womb of a surrogate southern white rhino.\n\nIVF across a sub species has never been tried before, but the team is confident it will work.\n\nProf Thomas Hildebrandt, the director of Liebniz IZW and project head for the Biorescue Consortium, said: \"I think the situation for the northern white rhino is quite privileged for the embryo transfer because we have a closely related recipient - so their internal map is nearly the same.\"\n\nNoone has ever tried to transfer an embryo into a different sub species\n\nThe Biorescue team hopes to implant the embryos in the coming months. They want the calf to be born while some northern white rhinos are still alive.\n\n\"We want to preserve the social communication, the social heritage of the northern white rhino by putting the first calf on the ground so they can learn the language from the last two rhinos, they can learn how to behave from them,\" explained Prof Hildebrandt.\n\nThe researchers are aware that adding some more animals through IVF will not save this species - there wouldn't be enough genetic diversity to create a viable population.\n\nSo they are simultaneously working on an even more experimental technique, attempting to create rhino sperm and eggs from stem cells, to go on to produce embryos.\n\nThe team is also looking at stem cell research to boost the northern white rhino population\n\nAgain, this will take time and there will be many scientific challenges to overcome.\n\nSome wildlife experts also argue that pouring more money and resources into a species that's as good as lost could be better used in saving more viable species.\n\nHowever, Jan Stejskal, the BioRescue project coordinator from Safari Park Dvur Kralove in the Czech Republic where Najin and Fatu were originally from, said: \"One thing that we have to understand is that behind the extinction of the northern white rhino is man. It's not because of some evolutionary pressure, it was greed, it was the consumption of a rhino horn.\n\n\"So, in a way, we are responsible and if we actually have a technique that can assist us to save them, then I think we have a responsibility to use it and to try to save them.\"\n\nSamuel Mutisya, head of research and species conservation at Ol Pejeta, added that the northern whites were a critical party of the ecosystem and the team was \"committed to do all that is humanly possible to nurture, protect and recover the species\".\n\nFollow Rebecca on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n• None BBC Future: Last male of his kind"}

A monitoring group said on Tuesday evening that the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and its allies were “at the gates of Hama”, but on Wednesday it said the military had retaken several villages in a counter-attack backed by intense air strikes. Syrian state media also said troops had pushed back the rebels north of the city, but the rebels denied losing any ground there. Hama is 110km (70 miles) south of Aleppo, which the rebels captured last week after launching a surprise offensive from their stronghold in the north-west.\n\nThe state-run Sana news agency and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, both reported intense fighting on Wednesday morning around Jabal Zain al-Abadin, a hill about 5km (3 miles) north-east of Hama. The SOHR said the clashes came after government forces launched a counter-attack, during which they were able to push the rebels back almost 10km from the city and recapture two villages near the hill. A spokesman for the rebel’s \"Military Operations Division\" accused the military of spreading rumours to raise the morale of its troops and insisted rebels were still in control of all locations they had recently taken. An affiliated news channel meanwhile said that five more villages east of Hama had been captured, as well as a base of the 25th Special Mission Forces Division.\n\nOn Tuesday, the SOHR reported that there had been “major displacement” from Hama, which is home to about 1 million people, after the rebels reached the city’s outskirts and several civilians were injured by their shellfire. Wassim, a delivery driver who lives in the city, told AFP news agency: \"The sounds were really terrifying, and the continuous bombing could be clearly heard”. But he added: \"I'll stay home because I have nowhere else to flee to.” The SOHR has said that more than 600 people have been killed, including 107 civilians, and tens of thousands have been displaced since the start of the rebel offensive last Wednesday.

Russian warplanes have intensified their strikes on rebel-held areas in recent days, Iran-backed militias have sent fighters to reinforce the government’s defensive lines around Hama, and Iran has said it is ready to send additional forces to Syria if asked. Turkey, which supports the Syrian opposition but has denied reports that it is involved in the HTS-led offensive, has urged Assad to engage in a political process with the opposition to bring an end to Syria’s 13-year civil war. Turkish-backed rebel factions have meanwhile capitalised on the government’s retreat in the north by launching a separate offensive on a pocket of territory near Aleppo that was controlled by a Kurdish-led militia alliance, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\nMore than half a million people have been killed since the civil war erupted in 2011 after Assad’s government cracked down violently on peaceful pro-democracy protests. Before the start of the rebel offensive, the government had regained control of Syria’s main cities with the help of Russia, Iran and Iran-backed militias. However, large parts of the country remained out of its control. The rebels’ last stronghold was in Aleppo and Idlib provinces, which border Turkey and where more than four million people were living, many of them displaced from government-held areas. The enclave was dominated by HTS, which is designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US, Turkey and other countries because it was al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria until it formally broke ties in 2016. A number of allied rebel factions and jihadist groups were also based there, along with Turkish-backed SNA factions and Turkish forces. In 2020, Turkey and Russia brokered a ceasefire to halt a push by the government to retake the region. That led to an extended lull in violence, but sporadic clashes, air strikes and shelling continued.\n\nSmoke rises from the town of Suran, between Aleppo and Hama, on Tuesday\n\nHTS and its allies said last Wednesday that they had launched an offensive to “deter aggression”, accusing the government and allied Iran-backed militias of escalating attacks on civilians in the north-west. But it came at a time when the government’s allies were preoccupied with other conflicts. The Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, which was crucial in helping push back rebels in the early years of the war, has suffered recently from Israel’s offensive in Lebanon. Israeli strikes have also eliminated Iranian military commanders in Syria and degraded supply lines to pro-government militias there. Russia has also been also distracted by the war in Ukraine.

{"context": "Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray has said he will resign before President-elect Donald Trump, who has indicated he would fire him, takes office next month. Wray announced at an internal FBI meeting on Wednesday that he had decided to step aside after weeks of consideration. Trump has already nominated Kash Patel, who has called for \"dramatically\" limiting the FBI's authority, to lead the law-enforcement agency. Wray, whom Trump nominated in 2017 to a 10-year term, has faced criticism during his tenure from Republicans due to the FBI's investigations into the former president after he left office.\n\nSpeaking at the FBI meeting on Wednesday, Wray said: \"I've decided the right thing for the bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current administration in January and then step down.\" \"In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work,\" Wray added. He received a standing ovation after his remarks, with some in the audience crying, an unnamed official told the Associated Press. Trump appointed Wray to lead the FBI after firing his predecessor James Comey following the FBI's investigations into alleged contacts between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia. When appointing him, Trump said Wray - a Yale Law School graduate - was a man of \"impeccable credentials\". But in recent years, Wray has fallen out of favour with the president-elect after the FBI assisted with a federal probe into Trump's handling of classified documents, a case that has since been dropped. Trump said Wray's resignation was \"a great day for America\". \"It will end the Weaponization of what has become known as the United States Department of Injustice,\" he said on Truth Social. \"We will now restore the rule of law for all Americans.\" Following his election to a second term, Trump said his pick for FBI director would be Patel - a former aide who has been a steadfast supporter of the incoming Republican president.\n\nPatel requires Senate approval before he can be appointed\n\nOn Wednesday, Patel said he was \"looking forward to a smooth transition and I'll be ready to go on day one\". \"Senators have been wonderful and I look forward to earning their trust and confidence through the advice and consent process, and restoring law and order and integrity to the FBI,\" he said. Patel requires approval by the Senate before he can be appointed. In the meantime, FBI deputy director Paul Abbate, a veteran FBI agent, will run the bureau after Wray's departure, th", "continuation": "e BBC's US partner CBS News reported. Patel has been a fierce critic of the FBI. In his memoir, Government Gangsters, Patel called for an eradication of \"government tyranny\" within the FBI by firing \"the top ranks\". Patel's critics have expressed doubts that he is qualified to lead one of the world's top law enforcement agencies. However, some Republican lawmakers have welcomed his nomination. \"Reform is badly needed at FBI,\" Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa wrote on X following news of Wray's resignation, adding that the American people deserve transparency and accountability. Wray has strongly denied he allowed a Democratic partisan agenda to run amok as FBI director, telling lawmakers a year ago at a House of Representatives hearing that he had been a lifelong Republican. \"The idea that I am biased against conservatives seems somewhat insane to me, given my own personal background,\" he said.\n\nUS Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, a Democrat, reacted to Wray's resignation by thanking him for his service and saying that the FBI \"will soon embark on a perilous new era with serious questions about its future.\" Wray was also praised by Attorney General Merrick Garland, who said in a statement that he had \"served our country honourably and with integrity for decades, including for seven years as Director of the FBI under presidents of both parties.\" The FBIAA, the association representing the bureau's agents, said that Wray led them \"through challenging times with a steady focus on doing the work that keeps our country safe.\" FBI directors are appointed for 10-year terms - a length chosen to outlast political turnovers in the White House every four years, and therefore the appearance of bias. Wray's term was not due to expire until 2027.

{"context": "Roje Stona's 2024 Olympic discus gold was his first medal at a major championships\n\nLittle more than four months after winning a historic gold medal for Jamaica, Olympic discus champion Roje Stona has set his sights on success in a completely different sport - American football. The 25-year-old is one of 14 athletes selected for the NFL's International Player Pathway (IPP) programme intake in January. The programme is a 10-week crash course for athletes from around the world to learn the skills needed to succeed in the NFL and give them the opportunity to earn a roster spot. Welsh rugby union international Louis Rees-Zammit, eighth-tier English rugby union player Travis Clayton, and Gaelic footballer Charlie Smyth were all selected by NFL teams after being part of the 2024 class. Stona's decision to go from throwing the discus to chucking his weight around a football field is probably the biggest surprise among the 2025 group, especially when you consider he has never played a competitive game of American football at any level. \"Unless you count Madden,\" joked Stona, referencing the popular video game series. \"I understand the work it's going to take,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I've done my research. I think a lot can happen in those eight to 10 weeks. I believe there's great coaches who can teach me a lot.\" When Stona topped the podium at Paris 2024 - setting an Olympic record of 70m in the process - it was the first time Jamaica had won gold in a throwing event. He received a hero's welcome on his return to the island and a message of congratulation from Usain Bolt. However, having reached the pinnacle of the sport he had dedicated his life to, Stona woke up one day with a burning question on his mind: what next? \"There was a little bit of a comedown [after Paris],\" he added. \"I've been throwing the discus and shotput for over 10 years, since I was a junior. \"The goal was to become the best in the world and that came in a great time. So after finishing college and thinking back on the year, that's when I decided I'd pursue my interest in football.\"\n\nStona set an Olympic record when he won discus gold in Paris in the summer\n\nStona said he fell in love with American football after being invited to watch a game while studying in South", "continuation": " Carolina at Clemson University, whose team became national champions in 2017 and 2019. He said: \"My first reaction when I got to the stadium was 'there's a lot of people here'. I am talking the type of crowd you'd see at the Olympics or World Championships - and they had this at a college football game. \"I went to more and more games, became more interested, then started watching the NFL. Then my goals just sort of shifted and I thought, 'I might have a shot at this. I should try it out.' However, Stona describes himself as a \"visual learner\" able to perfect a technique just by watching and repeating the process. After being invited to work out with the Green Bay Packers and New Orleans Saints last spring, Stona decided to take part in all the practice drills. An unusual move, but having never played the sport before he was unsure if he was best suited to play offence or defence. These sessions were also the first time he had worn American football equipment, including a helmet. \"Up until then I'd only seen the sport from the fan point of view, but then I went into these buildings and the coaches were talking about specific plays to run,\" he said. \"It was strange learning a new language.\" Coaches earmarked Stona as best suited to play tight end, catching passes, although his preferred position and the one he would like to pursue is defensive end, tasked with pressuring the quarterback. \"I'm a bit of a sponge,\" he added. \"Going behind the scenes, you see just how much strategy is involved in the game, but I have a lot of curiosity. \"Anything you do for the first time you get nervous, but my whole life has been competing at a high level, so I catch on fast. I am very coachable.\" What Stona lacks in experience on a football field he more than makes up for in athleticism and physicality - he listed at 6ft 6in and just shy of 19st. NFL analyst Lance Zierlein has highlighted Stona's \"outstanding size, length, musculation and explosiveness\". However, the notes on his weaknesses pointed to the fact he is new to the game and that he displayed \"some stiffness in lateral movements\". Stona says he is under no illusion about how much work it is likely to take to even make an NFL roster, let alone take to the field. He is aware hundreds have tried, and few have succeeded, including athletes from backgrounds closer to American football. For now, thoughts of defending his Olympic title in Los Angeles in 2028 are on the back burner. A competitive fire rages inside him, often fuelled by the response from those who are sceptical he can achieve his goal. \"I think it's 100% possible,\" he said. \"If you don't believe it can happen, it probably won't happen. \"I understand the work I have to put in. Discus took time. Football will take some time. I see some of the comments already, but I don't put limits on myself.\""}

The 33-year-old former undisputed super-middleweight boxing champion was taken down multiple times but rose ", "continuation": "to overwhelm her Brazilian opponent with an onslaught of punches at the Utilita Arena. Following the bout, Marshall was joined by long-term boxing adversary Claressa Shields in the cage, with the pair set to continue their rivalry in the PFL. \"Thank god I can punch. I've only been doing this nine months, but I've loved it,\" said Marshall. Marshall has made no secret of her desire to fight Shields under MMA rules, with the Hartlepool native revealing a big factor behind her move to the PFL was to pursue a fight with the 29-year-old American. Shields, who avenged her defeat at amateur level to beat Marshall in 2022 and become boxing’s undisputed middleweight world champion, made her PFL debut in 2021 and has won two of her three fights in the organisation. Marshall started MMA training nine months ago, citing a lack of challenges in boxing, and her appearance on the big screens early in the night at the Utilita Arena brought big cheers from fans. Marshall had been training with UFC interim heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall in preparation for her MMA bow, and cameras showed the Manchester fighter giving her some final words of encouragement as she wrapped her gloves. Walking out in a Newcastle United shirt, Marshall looked focused before entering and side-stepped around the cage to a rousing ovation. The round provided non-stop action from the bell as Marshall's straight right hand stung the 26-year-old Vargas, before the home favourite was wobbled by a leg kick. Marshall was then taken down by Vargas in the first grappling exchange of the fight. Pundits had cited grappling as being the potential downfall of Marshall following her transition to MMA, but under the tutelage of Aspinall and his father Andy - who were in her corner - she showcased the work she has done in jiu-jitsu by getting back to her feet.\n\nWith the crowd now also standing and in full voice, Marshall began her barrage of punches, rocking Vargas with straight left after straight right, but the Brazilian would secure another takedown with a desperate dive at the debutant's feet. Marshall looked in trouble briefly as Vargas attempted an arm triangle submission, but as the crowd drew in breath, she showed excellent defensive skills once more to get back to her feet. For the second time, Marshall then unloaded with piston-like strikes, forcing Vargas to cover up with little offence, and with the stats showing a 31-4 punch advantage, the referee stopped the contest. \"These MMA fighters, you’ve got to be a little bit crazy to do this,\" said Marshall. \"I've loved it, fight week, the training, the MMA community has welcomed me with open arms. It’s a tough sport and I take my hat off to any one who does it \"Mirela is a good opponent, kickboxing world champion, fair play to her for coming over. There's only three rounds, boxing you can take your time, but here they're on you from the first bell.\" Marshall then shared a moment of respect with Shields, as the smiling pair fist-bumped and agreed to fight under MMA rules in the PFL at a later date. But when asked if Marshall would be a regular in the PFL cage, she hinted that a return to boxing might be imminent if promotor Ben Shalom makes the right offer. \"I don't know. Ben Shalom's here, I told him you're going to have to get your purse out now, get the cheque-book out,\" added Marshall. Elsewhere on the card there were impressive wins for Britain's Jack Grant, who back-suplexed Charlie Leary before ending the contest with ground strikes, and compatriot Shanelle Dyer, who knocked out Mariam Torchinava with a spectacular head kick. The PFL also announced British former UFC fighter Marc Diakiese has signed a contract with the organisation.

It said 14 members of the crew had been rescued and taken to the Spanish port of Cartagena but that two others were missing. Ursa Major left port in St Petersburg 12 days ago, according to Russian news agency Interfax. The ship's owner said it was on its way to Vladivostok in Russia's Far East carrying two cranes for the port weighing 380 tonnes apiece, although the destination could not be confirmed independently.\n\nBefore Ursa Major sank, Spain's Salvamento Marítimo maritime rescue agency said 14 people were found on a lifeboat and taken", "continuation": " safely to Spain and a Russian warship then arrived in the area to take charge of the rescue operation. Ursa Major was in the same area of the Med as another sanctioned Russian ship, Sparta, when it ran into trouble and the two ships had been spotted heading through the English Channel last week, reportedly under escort. Earlier this month, Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) reported that the Sparta was heading to Russia's naval base on the Syrian coast at Tartous to move military equipment out of Syria after the downfall of Bashar al-Assad. A Kremlin official said on Monday that Russia was in contact with Syria's new rulers on the future of its two military facilities, at both diplomatic and military level. Ursa Major's owner Oboronlogistika has been heavily involved in transporting cargo to Tartous, although Sparta's reported destination on Tuesday was Port Said in Egypt.
